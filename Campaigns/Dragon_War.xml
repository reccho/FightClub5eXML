      <languages>You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The Halfling language isn&#39;t secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don&#39;t have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling.

If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

	The charmed target must use its action before moving on each of its turns to make a melee attack against a creature other than itself that you mentally choose. The target can act normally on its turn if you choose no creature or if none are within its reach.
	On your subsequent turns, you must use your action to maintain control over the target, or the spell ends. Also, the target can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the spell ends.

	While the creature is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey.

If the creature completes the order and doesn&#39;t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.
	You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn&#39;t do anything that you don&#39;t allow it to do.

	Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.

	Asleep: The target galls unconscious. It wakes up if it takes any damage or if another creature uses its action to shake the sleeper awake.
	Panicked: The target is frightened of you. On each of its turns, the frightened creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest and shortest available route, unless there is nowhere to move. If the target moves to a place at least 60 feet away from you where it can no longer see you, this effect ends.
	Sickened: The target has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. At the end of each of its turns, it can make another Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, the effect ends.

• The creature can&#39;t willingly move closer to the source of its fear.

	If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else&#39;s voice, a lion&#39;s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.
	If you create an image of an object, such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest, it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can&#39;t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.
	If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

        <text>You attempt to reshape another creature&#39;s memories. One creature that you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed by you for the duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and none o f the target&#39;s m emeries are modified.
	While this charm lasts, you can affect the target&#39;s memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory o f the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.
	You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature&#39;s memory isn&#39;t altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.
	A modified memory doesn&#39;t necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature&#39;s natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory o f how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.
	A remove curse or greater restoration spell cast on the target restores the creature&#39;s true memory.

At Higher Levels: If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target&#39;s memories o f an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature&#39;s past (9th level).

The entrance shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains open. You can open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the portal is invisible.
	Beyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.
	You can create any floor plan you like, but the space can&#39;t exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine course banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can&#39;t attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can&#39;t leave it. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion. When the spell ends, any creatures or objects left inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.

        <text>This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.
	The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target&#39;s (or the target&#39;s level, if it doesn&#39;t have a challenge rating). The target&#39;s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.
	The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn&#39;t reduce the creature&#39;s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn&#39;t knocked unconscious.
	The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can&#39;t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.
	The target&#39;s gear melds into the new form. The creature can&#39;t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.
	This spell can&#39;t affect a target that has 0 hit points.

	This spell also neutralizes any poison and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn&#39;t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects, if these aren&#39;t first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. The spell can&#39;t return an undead creature to life.
	This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn&#39;t restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival — its head, for instance — the spell automatically fails.
	Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.

        <text>This spell allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures that you can see within range. You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.
	The spell disguises physical appearances as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in-between. You can&#39;t change a target&#39;s body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.
	The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspections. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature&#39;s outfit objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature&#39;s head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner then you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.
	A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.

        <text>This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can&#39;t be held or carried by an unwilling creature. The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls d100 and consults the table.
	Familiarity:
	Permanent Circle — On Target 01-100
	Associated object — On Target 01-100
	Very familiar — Mishap 01-05, Similar Area 06-13, Off Target 14-24, On Target 25-100
	Seen casually — Mishap 1-33, Similar Area 34-43, Off Target 44-53, On Target 54-100
	Viewed once — Mishap 01-43, Similar Area 44-53, Off Target 54-73, On Target 74-100
	Description — Mishap 01-43, Similar Area 44-53, Off Target 54-73, On Target 74-100
	False destination — Mishap 01-50, Similar Area 51-100
	Familiarity: "Permanent circle" means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. "Associated object" means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard&#39;s library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich&#39;s secret tomb.
	"Very familiar" is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. "Seen casually" is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren&#39;t very familiar. "Viewed once" is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. "Description" is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else&#39;s description, perhaps from a map. "False destination" is a place that doesn&#39;t exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy&#39;s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.
	On Target: You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.
	Off Target: You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 x 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d 10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.
	Similar Area: You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that&#39;s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard&#39;s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.
	Mishap: The spell&#39;s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).

        <text>As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
	Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence — a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the DM. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.
	You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for one year. You need not use the circle to teleport when you cast the spell in this way.

        <text>After spending the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious gemstone, you touch a huge or smaller beast or plant. The target must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 3 or less. The target gains an Intelligence of 10. The target also gains the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a plant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human&#39;s. Your DM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such as the statistics for the awakened shrub or the awakened tree.
	The awakened beast or plant is charmed by you for 30 days or until you and your companions do anything harmful to it. When the charmed condition ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was charmed.

The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
	If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.

        <text>A storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see within range directly above you. The spell fails if you can&#39;t see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can&#39;t accommodate the cloud).
	When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.
	If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell&#39;s damage increases by 1d10.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher level, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.

	Blinding Sickness: Pain grips the creature&#39;s mind, and its eyes turn milky white. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is blinded.
	Filth Fever: A raging fever sweeps through the creature&#39;s body. The creature has disadvantage on Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and attack rolls that use Strength.
	Flesh Rot: The creature&#39;s flesh decays. The creature has disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage.
	Mindfire: The creature&#39;s mind becomes feverish. The creature has disadvantage on Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws, and the creature behaves as if under the effects of the confusion spell during combat.
	Seizure: The creature is overcome with shaking. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity checks, Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls that use Dexterity.
	Slimy Doom: The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably. The creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws. In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, it is stunned until the end of its next turn.

        <text>Until the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.
	Flood: You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave&#39;s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing. The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.
	Part Water: You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell&#39;s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.
	Redirect Flow: You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell&#39;s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.
	Whirlpool: This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn&#39;t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so. The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage, this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.

        <text>You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot- radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area.
	The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature&#39;s concentration is broken.
	When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.
	This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the DM.
	Fissures: Fissures open throughout the spell&#39;s area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM. Each is 1d10 x 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell&#39;s area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure&#39;s edge as it opens. A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).
	Structures: The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure&#39;s height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn&#39;t fall prone or become buried.

        <text>This spell allows you to find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specific fixed location that you are familiar with on the same plane of existence. If you name a destination on another plan of existence, a destination that moves (such as a mobile fortress), or a destination that isn&#39;t specific (such as a green dragon&#39;s lair), the spell fails.
	For the duration, as long as you are on the same plane of existence as the destination, you know how far it is and in what direction it lies. While you are traveling there, whenever you are presented with a choice of paths along the way, you automatically determine which path is the shortest and most direct route (but not necessarily the safest route) to the destination.

If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city from across the Sea of Fire, at the DM&#39;s discretion.
	Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.
	You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails the save, it is transported to a random location on the plane of existence you specify. A creature so transported must find its own way back to your current plane of existence.

A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.
	If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.
	At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down.

	This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all diseases, and lifts any curses affecting the creature when it died. The spell replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs. If the creature was undead, it is restored to its non-undead form.
	The spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists, in which case you must speak the creature&#39;s name. The creature then appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of you.

While in this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the Dash action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is incapacitated and can&#39;t move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.
	If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can&#39;t land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.

	If the target is native to the plane of existence you&#39;re on, you banish the target to a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is incapacitated. The target remains there until the spell ends, at which point the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
	If the target is native to a different plane of existence that the one you&#39;re on, the target is banished with a faint popping noise, returning to its home plane. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Otherwise, the target doesn&#39;t return.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th.

The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
	If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.
	If you target a nonmagical plant that isn&#39;t a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn&#39;t make a saving throw, it simply withers and dies.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.

        <text>You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger or smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.
	If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.
	Enlarge: The target&#39;s size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category — from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn&#39;t enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target&#39;s weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target&#39;s attack with them deal 1d4 extra damage.
	Reduce: The target&#39;s size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category — from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target&#39;s weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target&#39;s attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can&#39;t reduce the damage below 1).

        <text>You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can&#39;t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.
	The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.
	You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight five her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn&#39;t met before the spell expires, the activity isn&#39;t preformed.
	If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.

        <text>A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn&#39;t pushed.
	In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell&#39;s effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.

At Higher Levels:
	When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

	If the target is native to the plane of existence you&#39;re on, you banish the target to a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is incapacitated. The target remains there until the spell ends, at which point the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
	If the target is native to a different plane of existence that the one you&#39;re on, the target is banished with a faint popping noise, returning to its home plane. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Otherwise, the target doesn&#39;t return.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th.

Each humanoid in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make a Charisma saving throw a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two effects.
	You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.
	Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the DM rules otherwise.

        <text>You touch a point and infuse an area around it with holy (or unholy) power. The area can have a radius up to 60 feet, and the spell fails if the radius includes an area already under the effect a hallow spell. The affected area is subject to the following effects.
	First, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead can&#39;t enter the area, nor can such creatures charm, frighten, or possess creatures within it. Any creature charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed upon entering the area. You can exclude one or more of those types of creatures from this effect.
	Second, you can bind an extra effect to the area. Choose the effect from the following list, or choose an effect offered by the DM. Some of these effects apply to creatures in the area, you can designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that follow a specific deity or leader, or creatures of a specific sort, such as ores or trolls. When a creature that would be affected enters the spell&#39;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it can make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature ignores the extra effect until it leaves the area.
	Courage: Affected creatures can&#39;t be frightened while in the area.
	Darkness: Darkness fills the area. Normal light, as well as magical light created by spells of a lower level than the slot you used to cast this spell, can&#39;t illuminate the area.
	Daylight: Bright light fills the area. Magical darkness created by spells of a lower level than the slot you used to cast this spell can&#39;t extinguish the light.
	Energy Protection:. Affected creatures in the area have resistance to one damage type of your choice, except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.
	Energy Vulnerability: Affected creatures in the area have vulnerability to one damage type of your choice, except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.
	Everlasting Rest: Dead bodies interred in the area can&#39;t be turned into undead.
	Extradimensional Interference: Affected creatures can&#39;t move or travel using teleportation or by extradimensional or interplanar means.
	Fear: Affected creatures are frightened while in the area.
	Silence: No sound can emanate from within the area, and no sound can reach into it.
	Tongues: Affected creatures can communicate with any other creature in the area, even if they don&#39;t share a common language.

	A creature that partakes of the feast gains several benefits. The creature is cured of all diseases and poison, becomes immune to poison and being frightened, and makes all Wisdom saving throws with advantage. Its hit point maximum also increases by 2d10, and it gains the same number of hit points. These benefits last for 24 hours.

	This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting the creature when it died. It doesn&#39;t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, and the like, if such affects aren&#39;t removed prior to casting the spell, they afflict the target on its return to life.
	This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.
	Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.
	Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long rest, you can&#39;t cast spells again, and you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

	Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn&#39;t return the creature&#39;s soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can&#39;t learn new information, doesn&#39;t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can&#39;t speculate about future events.

	The spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists, in which case you must speak the creature&#39;s name. The creature then appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of you.

      <text>Perhaps the eldest of the dragons present, the Red Dragon once had big plans, long ago. Now she instead diverts all of her energy into fighting for her life, trying to escape the curse.

Following their imprisonment, a Gold Dragon came to stand guard; this dragon has now long-since died, their statue destroyed by dueling dragons.

Through all of it, only the White Dragon can truly say how much death and destruction she has seen - dozens of heroes and monsters have died here.

Still seeking vengeance, the White Dragon holds onto a primal anger, seeking to slay and destroy the latest Gold Dragon before escaping this prison. For her, vengeance is worth far more than freedom.</text>

In addition, the creature can use either an action or a bonus action on its turn, but not both. These effects last for 1 minute.

      </legendary>
      <text>This Copper Dragon once liberated a small city from the rule of a tyrannical Blue Dragon.

Upon mingling with the commoners afterward, one attempted to offer treasure, as they had to their old ruler. From this offering, the Copper Dragon took only two copper, stating that this payment was all that would ever be required - for the entire city.

For this, he earned their respect and love, along with his name. Humble, he doesn’t often go into detail about his past, although your Bard (or anyone with a high enough History check) may recognize them and their battle scars from stories past.</text>

      <name>-READING THIS ADVENTURE</name>
      <text>This adventure is written for 3-5 characters at level 20, forming an adventure of epic level and consequence. These pages will provide notes for adjusting the difficulty based on party size at the end (see Appendix E).

Intended as a one-shot, single session adventure (around 3-5 hours), this can instead be dropped into most existing settings and/or campaigns.

Please read this entire adventure before playing, to ensure everything is understood and prepared for.

At the end of this document, after the adventure, you will find several appendices, providing supplementary information such as stat blocks. Additionally, five pre-generated character sheets can be found after the appendices. These are not required to enjoy this adventure, but are available for those that wish to use them.</text>

      </name>
      <text>Entering a mysterious ruin, the party finds cryptic inscriptions and warnings carved into the stone walls.

Moving deeper, they discover a massive cavern, filled with stone rubble and gargantuan statues. As they watch, two of these statues come to life, revealing a Copper Dragon and a Green Dragon, both clearly ancient.

As a standoff ensues, the party learns that they have triggered an ancient trap. Having been cursed by entering, they will find themselves forced to choose sides as more dragons awaken, leading to an epic battle testing their fears, abilities, and even their very alignments.</text>

      <name>    -THE MISSING FARMER</name>
      <text>Traversing the countryside, the party enters a small village, living in the shadow of a large
mountain.

Opening in a tavern, the party is eating and drinking the night away. Speaking to the locals, the evening is light-hearted and fun until a dour middle-aged man enters the bar.
Eyebrows furrowed and eyes puffy from lack of sleep, this man takes a seat in a lonely corner of the bar, quietly ordering a drink from the bartender.

This man is Carlos Alves Sousa, as described in Appendix A. The mood in the tavern becomes a bit less joyful as he takes his seat, and an Insight check (DC 13) will show that people are not afraid - in fact, they seem to pity him.

If the party asks about Carlos, they’ll be sadly (and quietly) told a simple story: Carlos’s brother Rodrigo recently went up to the mountain, chasing ancient rumors of great treasure. Many people have sought this treasure throughout the years, but none have ever returned…including Rodrigo. Due to the fabled curse upon the mountain, he is presumed dead.

Carlos had begged him not to go, but Rodrigo didn’t listen, wanting to help his impoverished older brother afford better farm tools. Now in mourning, Carlos blames himself for his brother’s death.

Hopefully, this will be enough to entice the party up the mountain to explore for themselves. If for any reason they seem uninterested, the bartender (Marcos, also detailed in Appendix A) will quietly approach the party, of a modest amount of gold for this expedition, mostly to cover costs of food and supplies - including a small handful of Potions of Healing or Potions of Greater Healing, if desired. These can be purchased from another shop in town (Appendix B).</text>

      <text>Stretching high into the clouds, this mountain may not be comparable to Everest, but it does provide a steep climb for those willing to spare a day to climb it.

Not much plant life grows in the high snowy areas, which means fewer animals bother to venture that far up the mountain.</text>

      <name>    -A MYSTERIOUS RUIN</name>
      <text>Resting and gearing up, the party will ascend the mountain. If desired, you can describe the rough terrain and dangerous cliff that must be scaled along the way, requiring Athletics checks (DC 15) to climb successfully.

Any who fail this check will slip, potentially falling. If the party has thought to use climbing gear or rope, perhaps tying themselves together, require a Strength saving throw (DC 15) from the next party member as their body weight tugs at them suddenly.
If this party member fails their check, move on to the next, increasing the DC. They may find themselves each pulled from the ciffs if they’re not careful!

If they did not use rope or find themselves falling anyway, these characters will take 3d6 bludgeoning damage as they fall around 25-30 feet, landing hard on the gravel below.

Continuing the climb, they will eventually reach an area near the top, where they find an immense cave entrance. Over one hundred feet wide and tall, they may not realize it, but this cave is big enough for an ancient dragon to fly through…or worse, something bigger.</text>

      <text>Large in size and covered in ribbons of flowing script, these carvings have faded over years of
wind erosion. 

Nearly a mile in length, a creature trapped inside would need to fully exit this cave entrance into the outside world if they wish to escape the curse.</text>

      <name>    -STRANGE WARNINGS</name>
      <text>Allow them a short rest near the cave entrance if they wish. A full day hasn’t passed, so it’s a bit too early for a long rest (not that they need it) Assuming they began their trek at dawn, it’s likely noon by now - perhaps a couple hours
later if they struggled or have lower walking speeds.

Entering the cavern, it doesn’t take long before carvings start to gradually take form from the
rough rock. Although ancient, it is clear that these walls, floors, and ceiling were all polished smooth once, many centuries or millennia ago.

On these now-crumbling walls, the party will find strange hieroglyphs and writing. Some of it is illegible due to sections of the wall falling
away, and others are in unknown runic languages.

However, a History check (DC 18) will allow a character to recognize sections which resemble the languages of the Giants and the Abyss, along with various pieces of Elemental languages. Realizing this is a form of Primordial, any character who speaks this language will require only a History check of DC 13 to read it. 

Oddly cryptic and foreign, this Primordial writing seems to be an early dialect, potentially pre-dating anything else they’ve ever seen. If this writing can be translated, the players will find odd warnings and stories of some terrible monster or being, which is never fully described or explained.

Disturbingly, as the party presses forward, the clearest phrases soon shift from warnings to stay away to pleadings to never leave. Eerie and spine-chilling, these glyphs now seem determined to convince them that they will spend eternity within these halls.</text>

      <name>THE COLOSSAL CHAMBER</name>
      <text>Enormous in size, this place must have taken years to carve out. Even with magic, it would still take months and dozens of magic users, speaking to a truly impressive power wielded by the creators…especially considering the horrors trapped beneath the once-polished stone floors.</text>

      <name>    -CAVERN OF STATUES</name>
      <text>After walking a fair distance, the party eventually reaches a point where the already-massive passage opens up into an incredible cavern. Big enough to house a town - perhaps a city - this cavern is several hundred feet tall, stretching far into the darkness opposite the entry tunnel.

With dozens of immense stone pillars, this room - for it is a room, as your highest Passive Perception characters soon notice - has been
carefully carved, with the same once-smooth walls, floors, and ceilings as the entrance tunnel.

However, eons of time have caused several pillars to crumble, allowing various stone debris
and sections of the ceiling above to scatter below, forming massive blockages in the central areas of the room.

Along the walls, dirt and sand has begun to collect, as if massive winds pushed ancient piles of rock and dust against them.

Looking ahead, the party begins to see several gargantuan shapes in the darkness between the pillars, unmoving.

Approaching, these are clearly life-size statues of ancient dragons. As the party comes closer, a resounding crack echoes through the room, followed by the cacophonous sound of grating
stone.</text>

    <note>
      <name>    -WE SHOULD NOT HAVE COME</name>
      <text>As the party watches on, two of these statues quickly spring to life, their rock prisons cracking open and crumbling around their feet. Battle-scarred and clearly dangerous, one of these is an Ancient Green Dragon, while the
other is an Ancient Copper Dragon. 

Roaring at each other, the sound causes the floor to quake, as dust drifts from the ceiling above. With multiple sparks of blue light, several of their open wounds begin to close, clearly being healed by an unknown, powerful magic.

Noticing the party, the Copper Dragon will growl, moving to protect them from the Green
Dragon. Standing between them, this dragon will speak. “You should have heeded the warnings,” he rumbles, before continuing. “But it’s too late now. This prison houses terrible evil, and I stand as protector. If you wish to protect this world, let none escape this place.”

As the party readies to assist him (presuming a good-aligned party) or begins to speak, the Green Dragon begins to cackle with grating laughter. Interrupting the party if they are clearly planning to aid the Copper Dragon, the Green Dragon will choose their words carefully if the party hesitates.

“Fools. If you aid him, this place will become your prison also! For the curse to remain, none may leave…including you.”

As the Green Dragon speaks, allow a Perception check (DC 13). On a success a party member will notice faint movement in the corner of the room. Rock still crumbling from his shoulders and back, a man with similar facial features to Carlos is sneaking toward the exit, ducking behind pillars. Looking terrified, he motions for the party to stay silent.

However, both dragons quickly notice him. Eyes flicking in his direction, the Green Dragon continues speaking. “Are you prepared to spend eternity defending this place? Because that is what he asks of you.”

As Rodrigo bolts for the exit in a mad dash, the Copper Dragon roars, beating his wings. Forcing everyone nearby (within 15 feet) to make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 23), any who fail are knocked prone, taking 2d6+8 bludgeoning damage.

As they watch on in horror, Rodrigo is sent flying, crumpling against a pillar in a heap. Clearly dead, the party witnesses his skin slowly become stone once more.</text>

      <name>    -CHOOSING SIDES</name>
      <text>At this point, the party has limited time to choose sides before the other dragons awaken and Initiative is rolled.

Having just seen a good-aligned dragon kill an innocent man, a party who typically opposes evil may be stunned, unsure of who to help.

Allow them a couple quick questions, but keep answers brief, with both dragons attempting to sway them to their side.</text>

      <name>    -THE DRAGONS AWAKEN</name>
      <text>As can be quickly explained, any chromatic dragons present entered without knowing of the curse, planning to make this place their new lair.

Wise metallic dragons who knew the truth recognized the threat posed if a chromatic dragon escaped, and slowly gathered over time to prevent anyone from leaving, as is the point of the stone curse - to collect ‘immortal’ guardians, revived through the ages to defend the prison. 

With the basic details, the party must choose. As the party aligns with either the chromatic or metallic dragons, this choice will affect the upcoming battle.

As more cracks echo through the chamber, several more dragons begin to awaken in the further reaches of the room. Too far for the party to interfere, one awakened dragon will crash through three other stone dragons, destroying and killing them - after all, the only way to die within this chamber is to have your statue broken. These three slain dragons are of the same type aligned with the party, leaving two allied dragons against five opposing (one CR 21/22 and one CR 23/24 - your choice). For example, if the party decides to align with the Green Dragon (whatever their reasons), three chromatic dragons will be destroyed, leaving the party with only two chromatic allies against five metallic enemies.

This balances this encounter, as dragons would quickly tear each other apart in a boring battle if their numbers were even. This way, the dragons need the party if they wish to succeed.</text>

      <name>    -RUNNING THIS ENCOUNTER</name>
      <text>Rolling for Initiative, 
be sure to roll separately for each dragon. This will help space their turns throughout those of your party, so they don’t get bored. 

With seven dragons and 3-5 players, there are 10-12 turns each round. With Legendary Actions, dragons are able to act after another creature’s turn, which could bog down combat if used poorly. To avoid this, only allow two Legendary Actions per turn. This way, you won’t get distracted, keeping each turn manageable. Even with ten turns per round, this means only a single Legendary Action will go unspent, which could be used for a Wing Attack if you’d like a 3-Action round. Even still, you’ll need to be quick. Decide which Dragons will take Legendary Actions next as your players take their turns, to keep things moving.

Additionally, keep in mind that if a Legendary Action costs two actions, that’s it for the round! Two counts as two, whether two dragons make Tail Attacks or one is making a Wing Attack. This can be a deadly encounter for your players if they’re not careful, or if the dice don’t go their way. But, that’s the fun of an Epic Level adventure - high stakes!

To help you keep track of everything, we’ve provided cheat sheets in Appendix F, detailing each dragon and info you’ll need during battle.

Although full stats are provided in Appendix C, you likely won’t need them if you use the cheat sheets instead.</text>

      <name>      =ALLIES OF CONSEQUENCE</name>
      <text>Keep in mind, their allies do matter. All the chromatic dragons need to do in order to win is escape, which means the metallic dragons are
going to be playing defense, trying to prevent anyone from leaving.

Additionally, the chromatic dragons aren’t exactly allies here, unlike the unified metallic dragons. If a breath weapon or Wing Attack
accidentally hits another chromatic dragon or even a member of the party, they won’t really care. Their own survival is of the utmost importance.

Also, feel free to substitute in Gem Dragons from Fizban’s Treasury of Dragons if you like, or even other dragon types if that sounds fun!</text>

      <name>      =MORALITY TWIST</name>
      <text>If you’d like to put an interesting morality spin on this adventure, you could even have the lawful chromatic dragons (Blue and Green) ally themselves with the lawful metallic dragons (Bronze, Gold, and Silver).

For this scenario, providing an interesting twist, lawful evil dragons may recognize the danger of allowing anything to escape the chamber, thus working together with unlikely allies. Meanwhile more chaotic dragons may view themselves as strong enough to escape or defeat the coming apocalypse themselves, causing a
strange clash of alignment.</text>

      <name>    -PURPOSE…OR DOOM</name>
      <text>Having defeated their enemies, the party still has an important choice to make. They’re free to change their minds, after all…however, the
guardian dragons might require convincing to allow this. If failed, the party may find themselves fighting their once-allies for their
desired freedom.

Are they willing to remain here as protectors, preventing the apocalypse for eternity? It’s a
worthy purpose.

Or, is the party willing to risk it all, unleashing chaos upon the world on the gamble that they can defeat it?

This is a battle they might not win. Are they truly strong enough to stop the apocalypse? Or will their hubris doom this world forever?</text>

      <name>MOVING FORWARD</name>
      <text>Greater Restoration can cure Rodrigo of his petrification. If they all survive the end of the world, he might be able to return to his brother, with treasure left behind by the dragons. 

If they choose to stay, Wish or Divine Intervention may be enough to save a player character. However, some may be left behind to their new destiny, if they desire it.

So, what will these heroes choose? To tempt the fates, or to partake in eternal battle? Either way, there will be consequences…</text>
