# About these Files

The files in this folder are notes you can import directly to your character in the Notes section. Why would you want to do that? Well, as amazing as Fight Club is, it has a few drawbacks. It doesn't really offer a good way to keep track of proficiencies (beyond skills and saves), to monitor your character's action economy, or to record your character's roleplaying traits or background. That's where Notes come in, and these files give you standardized templates for all of that.

Additionally, while the spells and bestiary files are great, it's a bit harder to connect the two. Conjure Animals tells you you can summon a CR 2 beast, but figuring out what beasts are CR 2 or less is kind of time consuming. In GM 5, there's no way to search the bestiary by Type, and indeed in Fight Club there's no way to list the creatures by CR at all. The files in the Conjure Creatures folder help with that, by listing all the valid creatures for various summoning spells.

The Character Notes file will add several notes:
- Backstory, a place to put your character's backstory
- Allies and Organizations, a place to put all the people your character is familiar with.
- Treasures, a place to put the treasures and trinkets you find on your adventures.
- Roleplaying Statistics, a place to put alignment, personality traits, ideals, bonds, flaws, and all that jazz, with a template.

The next four replicate a suggestion from Mike Mearls, the game's lead designer, about how to keep track of your character's action economy. Mike suggests writing all of your character's available Actions, Bonus Actions, and Reactions on notecards, and turning the card over when you take the corresponding action each turn. When you begin your turn, turn all three face up again.

These notes serve the same purpose. They're pre-populated with all the standard actions; you simply need to add any you gain from race, class, or other features. If you want, you can even replicate the card-flipping tracker idea: expand all three at the start of your turn, and collapse each as you use it. This will help you keep track of whether you still have your reaction available to take an opportunity attack, for example.

The fourth card is a similar idea. It gives you a place to list all of your spells which require concentration. Expand it if you're not concentrating and collapse it if you are, and it will remind you.

The files in the proficiency folder list the starting weapon, tool, armor, language, and save proficiencies for each class. This gives you a nicely-formatted place to combine all of your proficiencies from your class, background, and race, as well as any other feature which grants you proficiencies, and see them all in one place. Import the one appropriate for your starting class and add your skills, languages, and tools from other features, and you're good to go. The formatting might require a little adjustment to make sure it looks good, but once you're set, it's quite nice to have.
