  <description>In this new Unearthed Arcana document, we explore material designed for upcoming books, using rules from the 2024 Player's Handbook. This playtest document presents a revised Artificer, along with 4 revised subclasses: Alchemist, Armorer, Artillerist, and Battle Smith. It also presents a new spell and a number of new magic items.

This Is Playtest Content:
The material in Unearthed Arcana is presented for playtesting and to spark your imagination. These game mechanics are in draft form, usable in your D&amp;D campaign but not refined by final game development. They are not officially part of the game. For these reasons, material in this column is not legal in D&amp;D Adventurers League events.</description>
