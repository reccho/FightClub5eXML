      <feature>
        <name>Level 1: Spellcasting</name>
        <text>You have learned how to channel magical energy through objects. See the Player's Handbook for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Artificer spells, which appear in the Artificer spell list later in the class's description.

Tools Required:
You produce your Artificer spells through tools. You can use Thieves' Tools, Tinker's Tools, or another kind of Artisan's Tools with which you have proficiency as a Spellcasting Focus, and you must have one of those focuses in hand when you cast an Artificer spell (meaning the spell has an "M"
component when you cast it).

Cantrips:
You know two Artificer cantrips of your choice. Acid Splash and Prestidigitation are recommended.
	Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Artificer cantrip of your choice.
	When you reach Artificer levels 10 and 14, you learn another Artificer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Artificer Features table.

Spell Slots:
The Artificer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a Long Rest.

Prepared Spells of Level 1+:
You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Artificer spells. Cure Wounds and Grease are recommended.
	The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Artificer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Artificer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Artificer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 5 Artificer, your list of prepared spells can include six Artificer spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.
	If another Artificer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Artificer spells for you.

Changing Your Prepared Spells:
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Artificer spells for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability:
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Artificer spells.

      </feature>
      <feature>
        <name>Level 1: Magical Tinkering</name>
        <text>You know the Mending cantrip.

As a Magic action while holding Tinker's Tools, you can create one item in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of yourself, choosing the item from the following list:

	• Ball Bearings
	• Basket
	• Bedroll
	• Bell
	• Blanket
	• Block and Tackle
	• Bucket
	• Caltrops
	• Candle
	• Crowbar
	• Flask
	• Jug
	• Lamp
	• Net
	• Oil
	• Paper
	• Parchment
	• Pole
	• Pouch
	• Rope
	• Sack
	• Shovel
	• String
	• Tinderbox
	• Torch
	• Vial

See the rules for the item in the Player's Handbook. The item lasts until you finish a Long Rest, at which point it vanishes.
	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

      <feature>
        <name>Level 2: Replicate Magic Item</name>
        <text>You have learned arcane plans that you use to make magic items.

Plans Known:
When you gain this feature, choose four plans to learn from the Magic Item Plans (Artificer Level 2+) table (see the Dungeon Master's Guide for the items' descriptions). Bag of Holding, Cap of Water Breathing, Sending Stones, and Wand of the War Mage +1 are recommended. Whenever you gain an Artificer level, you can replace one of the plans you know with a new plan for which you qualify.
	You learn another plan of your choice when you reach certain Artificer levels, as shown in the Plans Known column of the Artificer Features table. When you choose a plan to learn, you choose it from any Magic Item Plans table for which you qualify; your qualification is based on your Artificer level.

Creating an Item:
When you finish a Long Rest, you can create one or two different magic items if you have Tinker's Tools in hand. Each item is based on one of the plans you know for this feature.
	If a created item requires Attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you create it. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for Attunement.
	When you reach certain Artificer levels specified in the Magic Items column of the Artificer Features table, the number of magic items you can create at the end of a Long Rest increases. Each item you create must be based on a different plan you know.
	If you try to exceed your maximum number of magic items for this feature, the oldest item vanishes, and then the new item appears.

Duration:
A magic item created by this feature functions as the normal magic item, except its magic isn't permanent. When you die, the magic item vanishes after 1d4 days. If you replace a plan you know with a new plan, any magic item created with the replaced plan immediately vanishes.
	If an item that you created with this feature is a container, such as a Bag of Holding, and it vanishes, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.

Spellcasting Focus:
You can use any Wand or Weapon created by this feature as a Spellcasting Focus in lieu of using a set of Artisan's Tools.

Charge Magic Item:
As a Bonus Action, you can touch a magic item within 5 feet of yourself that you created with Replicate Magic Item and uses charges. You recharge the item and expend a level 1+ spell slot. The number of charges an item regains is equal to the level of spell slot expended.

Drain Magic Item:
As a Bonus Action, you can touch a magic item within 5 feet of yourself that you created with Replicate Magic Item and cause the item to vanish, converting its magical energy into a spell slot. The slot is level 1 if the item is Common or level 2 if the item is Uncommon or Rare. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest. Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a Long Rest.

Transmute Magic Item:
As a Magic action, you can touch one magic item within 5 feet of yourself that you created with Replicate Magic Item and transform it into a different magic item. The resulting item must be based on a magic item plan you know. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

	While holding the object, a creature can take a Magic action to produce the spell's effect from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires Concentration, the creature must concentrate. Once a creature has used the object to produce the spell's effect, the object can't be used this way again until the start of the creature's next turn.
