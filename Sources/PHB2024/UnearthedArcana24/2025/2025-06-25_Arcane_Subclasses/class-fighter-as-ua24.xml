        <text>Deploy Magical Effects through Enchanted Ammunition

An Arcane Archer studies a unique elven method of archery that weaves magic into attacks to produce supernatural effects. The first Arcane Archers stood watch over their communities, keeping a keen eye out for dangers and using magic-infused arrows to defeat monsters and invaders. Over the centuries, other species have learned the elves' mystical methods of blending arcane aptitude with archery and broadened their application to ranged weapons of many kinds while applying those talents to an adventuring life.

DESIGN NOTE: ARCANE ARCHER UPDATES
Here are the main updates in this subclass since its appearance in Xanathar's Guide to Everything:

	• Arcane Archer Lore now gives you proficiency in both the Arcana and Nature skills.

	• Arcane Shot has been redesigned. The feature now allows you to use any weapon with the Ammunition property. You now use the Arcane Shot Die it grants for extra damage in the options you select.

	• Ever Ready Shot is now available at a lower level.

	• Improved Shots, Powerful Shots, and Masterful Shots are new features that improve your Arcane Shot Die. They incorporate prior damage increases to your Arcane Shot options but spread the increases across more levels of play.

Using Arcane Shot. Once per turn when you make a ranged attack using a weapon with the Ammunition property, you can apply one of your Arcane Shot options to that attack. You decide to use the option when you hit a creature and deal damage to it unless the option doesn't involve an attack roll.
	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

Arcane Shot Die. Arcane Shot options refer to your Arcane Shot Die. Your Arcane Shot Die is a d6.

Saving Throws. If an Arcane Shot option requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Intelligence modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus.

This extra attack doesn't require ammunition.

    <text>Your magic temporarily sequesters your target in a harmless demiplane. The creature you hit takes additional Psychic damage equal to one roll of your Arcane Shot Die and must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished.

The Charmed condition ends early if the charmer attacks the target, deals damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw.

    <text>You give your ammunition an ethereal quality. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the ammunition shoots forward in a 30-foot Line that is 1 foot wide, originating from you, then vanishes. The Line ignores cover, as the ammunition phases through solid objects. Each creature in the Line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit plus additional Piercing damage equal to two rolls of your Arcane Shot Die. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

    <text>You grant your ammunition the ability to seek out a target. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the last minute. The ammunition flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring Half Cover and Three-Quarters Cover. If the target is within your weapon's long range, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Otherwise, the ammunition disappears after traveling as far as it can. On a failed save, the target takes damage as if it were hit plus additional Force damage equal to two rolls of your Arcane Shot Die, and you learn the target's current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.
