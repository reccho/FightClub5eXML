        <text>Step Across Space and Call Creatures from Thin Air

You consider distance and matter to be flexible guidelines rather than physical laws. Conjurers harness the power of magic that moves creatures instantly through space and summons creatures to fight on their behalf.

DESIGN NOTE: CONJURER UPDATES

	• Benign Transposition is now available at a lower level, and the new Distant Transposition and Quick Teleportation features improve it.

	• Conjuration Savant now gives you free Conjuration spells to add to your spellbook.

	• Durable Summons is now available at a lower level, and the Temporary Hit Points it grants are based on your Wizard level.

	Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 2+ spell slot (no action required).

Your magic clouds or captivates minds. Some Enchanters use their abilities to encourage peace and soften cruelty, while others use their mind-altering magic for selfish ends. Many Enchanters fall somewhere in between.

DESIGN NOTE: ENCHANTER UPDATES
Here are the main updates in this subclass since its appearance in the 2014 Player's Handbook:

	• Enchantment Savant now gives you free Enchantment spells to add to your spellbook.

	• Enchanting Talker and Vexing Movement are new features that replace Hypnotic Gaze, giving the Wizard new options to use in and out of combat.

	• Reflecting Charm replaces the former Instinctive Charm feature; instead of compelling an attacker to choose a new target, the feature now reliably reduces the damage you take and might harm the attacker.

	• Bolstering Belief is a new feature to aid yourself and allies in many situations.

You explore the cosmic forces of life, death, and undeath. As a Necromancer, you learn to manipulate the energy that animates all creatures. As you progress, you learn to use magic to drain the life force from a creature, transforming its vital energy into magical power. Many see Necromancers as menacing or villainous, though not all Necromancers are evil. Nevertheless, the manipulation of life and death is considered taboo in many societies.
