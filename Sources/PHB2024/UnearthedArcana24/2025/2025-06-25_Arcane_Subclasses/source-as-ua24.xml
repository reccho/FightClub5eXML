  <description>Get ready to be enchanted by the latest Unearthed Arcana content! This document presents nine subclasses: revised subclasses for the Cleric (Arcana Domain), Fighter (Arcane Archer), Warlock (Hexblade Patron), and Wizard (Conjurer, Enchanter, Necromancer, and Transmuter) and new subclasses for the Monk (Tattooed Warrior) and Sorcerer (Ancestral Sorcery). The material uses the rules in the Player's Handbook.

This Is Playtest Content
The material in Unearthed Arcana is presented for playtesting and to spark your imagination. The options here are experemental and in draft form, usable in your D&amp;D campaign but not refined by final game development. They are not officially part of the game. For these reasons, material in this column is not legal in D&amp;D Adventurers League events. Your feedback will help determine whether we adopt it as official.</description>
