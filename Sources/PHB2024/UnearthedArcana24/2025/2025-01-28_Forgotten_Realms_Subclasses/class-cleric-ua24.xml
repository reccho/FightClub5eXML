        <text>Unearth Secrets and Master the Mind

The Knowledge Domain values learning and understanding above all. Clerics who tap into this domain study esoteric lore, collect old tomes, delve into the secret places of the earth, and examine the process of the mind itself.

Gods of knowledge vary from masters of arcane magic to patrons of craft and invention. To them, knowledge is more valuable than material wealth, and the desire to learn is an act of worship. Libraries, universities, and other institutions dedicated to education also draw on the power of the Knowledge Domain.

On Faerûn, Clerics of the Knowledge Domain worship deities of learning and ingenuity like Oghma and Gond. Other powerful deities—such as Asmodeus, Mystra, Savras, and Jergal—also count Clerics of the Knowledge Domain among their devotees, as do less-common divinities like Deneir, the Scribe of Oghma, and Azuth, servant of Mystra.
