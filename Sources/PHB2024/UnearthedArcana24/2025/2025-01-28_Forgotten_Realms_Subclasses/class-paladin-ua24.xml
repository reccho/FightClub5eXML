        <name>Paladin Subclass: Oath Of The Noble Genies (UA)</name>
        <text>Brandish the Elemental Splendor of Genies

Paladins sworn to the Oath of the Noble Genies revere the forces of the Elemental Planes. Through taking this oath, Paladins draw power from the four different types of genies—dao, masters of earth; djinn, masters of air; efreet, masters of fire; and marids, masters of water—to create splendid and destructive displays of elemental might.

On Faerûn, many Paladins who swear this oath hail from Calimshan, a land rife with genie-kind. Despite their strong local ties, these Calishite Paladins often undertake quests that take them all over the Realms and across the multiverse—including, naturally, the Elemental Planes.

These paladins share the following tenets:

	• Beget creation with destruction.
	• Lead with splendor and grace.
	• Respect the elements, and fear their wrath.

        <name>Level 3: Elemental Smite (Oath Of The Noble Genies (UA))</name>
        <text>Immediately after you cast Divine Smite, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity and invoke one of the following effects.

Dao's Crush. The target has the Grappled condition (escape DC equal to your spell save DC). While Grappled, the target has the Restrained condition.

Djinni's Escape. You teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of yourself and take on a mist-like form, which lasts until the end of your next turn. While in this form, you have Immunity to the Grappled, Prone, and Restrained conditions.

Efreeti's Fury. The target takes an extra 2d4 Fire damage.

Marid's Surge. The target and each creature of your choice in a 10-foot Emanation originating from you makes a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is pushed 15 feet straight away from you and has the Prone condition.
