        <name>Otherworldly Patron: Hexblade (UA)</name>
        <text>You've made a pact with a sentient magic weapon and the cursed forces contained within its blade. Such a weapon could be the sword sheathed at a Warlock's side, or it could be an infamous magic weapon stored elsewhere, projecting its power across the multiverse to further its cunning plans. To those who are willing to follow this weapon's whims, these inscrutable patrons offer the power to bestow malignant curses, deliver punishing blows, and bolster the wielder.

Design Note: Hexblade Patron Updates:
Here are the main updates in this subclass since its appearance in Xanathar's Guide to Everything:

	• Hexblade Spells (formerly Expanded Spell List) now gives you a list of always prepared spells. The spells granted have been revised.

	• Hexblade Manifest is a new feature, allowing you to cast Hex a number of times without a spell slot. It also grants you a handful of unique ways to interact with your cursed target.

	• Life Stealer is a new feature that interacts with the Hex spell to provide healing and reliable damage.

	• Armor of Hexes now more reliably reduces damage taken.

	• Masterful Hex is a new feature that boosts the power of Hexblade Manifest.

        <name>Level 3: Hexblade Manifest (Hexblade (UA))</name>
        <text>Your patron grants you the power to summon cursed echoes of its blade to hinder your foes. You gain the following benefits.

Hexblade's Curse. You can cast Hex without expending a spell slot a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. When you cast Hex, a spectral weapon resembling your patron orbits the cursed target.

Hexblade's Maneuvers. Once per turn, when you hit a target cursed by your Hex with an attack roll, you can cause one of these additional effects:

	• Draining Slash. The target makes a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target can't make Opportunity Attacks and its Speed is halved until the start of your next turn.

	• Harrowing Blade. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the next time the target makes an attack roll against a creature other than you before the start of your next turn, the target takes Necrotic damage equal to your Charisma modifier.

	• Stymying Mark. The target has Disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Otherworldly Patron: Undead Patron (UA)</name>
        <text>Defy Death for Profane Power

You've made a pact with a creature that defies the cycle of life and death: a powerful lich, vampire, or other entity of undeath. Having once been mortal themselves, these ancient patrons know firsthand the paths of ambition and the routes past the doors of death. They eagerly share this profane knowledge, along with other secrets, with those who work their will among the living.

Design Note: Undead Patron:
Here are the main updates in this subclass since its appearance in Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft:

	• Undead Spells (formerly Expanded Spell List) now gives you a list of always prepared spells.

	• Grave Touched now allows your spells and attacks to ignore Resistance to Necrotic damage.

	• Necrotic Husk no longer requires a Reaction to use its secondary feature, and it restores you to a number of Hit Points equal to 10 times your Charisma modifier.

	• Superior Dread is a new feature that improves your Form of Dread, allowing you to fly, regain Hit Points, and improve your spellcasting.
