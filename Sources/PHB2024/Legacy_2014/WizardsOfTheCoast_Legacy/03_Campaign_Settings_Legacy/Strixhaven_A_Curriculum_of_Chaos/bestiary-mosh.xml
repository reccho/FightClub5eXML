      <text>Using a 10-minute ritual, the daemogoth can forge a magical bond with a willing creature it touches throughout the ritual. The creature becomes bound by the pact until it dies, the daemogoth dies, or the pact is broken by any effect that can remove a curse.

The daemogoth chooses one spell from the necromancy or enchantment school that is 3rd level or lower. The bound creature can cast that spell using this pact, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability. When it casts the spell, the creature takes 7 (2d6) psychic damage, which can't break the creature's concentration on a spell. Once the bound creature casts the spell in this way, it can't do so again until it finishes a long rest.</text>

      <text>Each creature of the guide's choice that is within 30 feet of the guide must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed by the guide for 1 hour.

A charmed target must move on its turn toward the guide, trying to get within 5 feet of the guide. The target doesn't move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. Whenever the charmed target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

A target that successfully saves is immune to any guide's Smile and Wave ability for the next 24 hours.</text>

      <name>Sanguine Sense</name>

    <action>
      <name>Blood Lash</name>
      <text>Melee Spell Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d10 + 5) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it can't regain hit points until the start of the Y'demi's next turn.</text>

    <action>
      <name>Blood Boil (Recharge 4-6)</name>
      <recharge>D4</recharge>
      <text>Y'demi chooses a point within 150 feet of itself, and a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that point fills with a burst of searing, blood-red mist. Each creature of Y'demi's choice that she can see in that area must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 38 (7d10) necrotic damage and is incapacitated until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't incapacitated. A creature dies if reduced to 0 hit points by this necrotic damage.</text>

      <name>Sanguine Tentacles (1/Day) (Bonus Action)</name>
      <recharge>1/DAY</recharge>
      <text>The blood in the copper basin disappears as tentacles of congealed blood fill a 10-foot cube centered at a point on the ground that Y'demi can see within 15 feet of her. The effect lasts for 1 minute, during which time that area is difficult terrain. Any creature entering that area for the first time on a turn or starting its turn there must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by the tentacles. A creature that starts its turn restrained by the tentacles takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage. A creature restrained by the tentacles can use its action to make either a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check or a DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, ending the restrained condition on itself on a success.</text>
