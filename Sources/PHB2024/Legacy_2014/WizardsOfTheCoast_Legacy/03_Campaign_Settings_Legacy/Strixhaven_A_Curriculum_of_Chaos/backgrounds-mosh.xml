	• Skill Proficiencies: History, Religion
	• Languages: Two of your choice
	• Equipment: A bottle of black ink, an ink pen, a hammer, a hooded lantern, a tinderbox, a tome of history, a school uniform, and a pouch containing 15 gp

      <text>You gain the Strixhaven Initiate feat and must choose Lorehold within it.

In addition, if you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, the spells on the Lorehold Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

Lorehold Initiate Spells:
Level | Spells
1st | Comprehend Languages, Identify
2nd | Borrowed Knowledge, Locate Object
3rd | Speak with Dead, Spirit Guardians
4th | Arcane Eye, Stone Shape
5th | Flame Strike, Legend Lore

Consider customizing how your spells look when you cast them. Your Lorehold spells might create displays of golden light. You might use a tome or a scroll as a spellcasting focus, and your spell effects might reflect the appearance of the reference books you study.</text>

      <name>Building a Lorehold Character</name>
      <text>Any class or subclass that deals with knowledge of the past can be a good fit in Lorehold. Bards thrive in Lorehold, and wizards (particularly those of the School of Divination) are numerous among its students. Clerics (often with the Knowledge or Light domains) are also quite common.

For a more unusual take on a Lorehold student, you could consider playing a barbarian with a primal connection to the past (perhaps adopting the Path of the Ancestral Guardian from Xanathar's Guide to Everything) or a paladin whose Oath of the Ancients gives a concrete link to history.</text>

Lorehold Trinkets:

1 | A map made of concentric circles that can be rotated around the page
2 | A puzzle box bedecked with amber
3 | A dented brass compass with a red needle
4 | The head of a broken statue that houses the consciousness of a snarky sage

d6 | Personality Trait
1 | I thrive on esoteric lore. The more obscure the historical references I can include in everyday conversation, the better.
2 | By searching for these lost artifacts, I hope to find who I really am along the way.
3 | I can barely go a minute without talking about my research. I have so much knowledge in my head, and it needs to be let out somewhere!
4 | The spirits of the dead are so much more interesting to talk with than living classmates.
5 | I can speak eloquently about the historical ramifications of an ancient war. But ask me to add two-digit numbers together, and I'm a mess.
6 | In the end, it's all just entropy. Everything falls apart someday.</text>

      <text>You are an artist, and you have been preparing to hone your craft according to the traditions of Prismari College. Whatever your medium—sculpture, dance, paint, music, drama, architecture, or any other field—you have grand visions of bringing your art to life in a fusion of magic and creativity.

In addition, if you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, the spells on the Prismari Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

Prismari Initiate Spells:

1st | Chromatic Orb, Thunderwave
2nd | Flaming Sphere, Kinetic Jaunt
3rd | Haste, Water Walk
4th | Freedom of Movement, Wall of Fire
5th | Cone of Cold, Conjure Elemental

Consider customizing how your spells look when you cast them. You might wield your Prismari spells with dynamic, gestural movement—as much dance as somatic component. Even a blast of fire in your hands is a sculpted work of art; elemental forces make grand designs as you hurl spells. These forces might linger on your body or in your clothes as decorative elements after your spells are dissipated, as sparks dance in your hair and your touch leaves tracings of frost on whatever you touch.</text>

      <text>Any class or subclass that wields elemental forces of cold, fire, lightning, and wind can be a good fit in Prismari. Druids and sorcerers are common in Prismari, and wizards who study the Schools of Evocation or Transmutation are also well represented. Clerics aren't very common in this school, but some with the Tempest domain end up here.

Beyond the ranks of traditional spellcasters, Prismari students also include monks who follow the Way of the Four Elements. Some acrobatic rogues and fighters (including those who emulate the archetype of the Eldritch Knight) also delight in the athleticism of Prismari performance.</text>

d6 | Personality Trait
1 | I'm the life of the party, and I expect everyone's attention when I walk into a room.
2 | Two weeks ago, I was enthralled with my latest project. Now, I think it's garbage and deserves to be destroyed.
3 | I believe everyone has the ability to express their truest selves through art, and I'm happy to quietly push them in the right direction.
4 | Everyone is a critic, and I work to win them all over.
5 | I'm beset with such an overwhelming sense of ennui regarding my art. Nothing quite captures my attention anymore.
6 | Instead of confronting my negative emotions, I channel them into explosive artistic displays.</text>

      <text>In preparation to become a student of Quandrix College, you have spent years working through the college's math problems for prospective students. Your interests concentrate on the mathematical principles and patterns found in the natural world. You might lean more toward mathematics or physics, or you delve into more abstract studies of metaphysics, arcana, or logic.

	• Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan's tools

2nd | Enlarge/Reduce, Vortex Warp
3rd | Aura of Vitality, Haste
4th | Control Water, Freedom of Movement
5th | Circle of Power, Passwall

Consider customizing how your spells look when you cast them. Your Quandrix spells might manifest amid kaleidoscopic swirls of fractal patterns, amplifying the tiniest movements of your somatic components. When your magic creates or alters creatures, it might briefly surround the targets with shimmering fractal designs or tessellated patterns.</text>

Both the scholarly focus of wizards (especially those who study the Schools of Abjuration, Illusion, or Transmutation) and the metamagic manipulations of sorcerers are welcome in Quandrix, and many druids explore the patterns of nature in Quandrix as well. A few clerics, particularly those with the Knowledge or Nature domains, study in Quandrix as well.

Aside from traditional spellcasters, a few characters of other classes find homes in Quandrix. Some fighters, monks, rangers, and rogues study here, using Quandrix principles to train their minds.</text>

2 | I hope this all makes sense to me one day. Until then, I'm going to keep faking it.
3 | Equations and patterns come naturally to my mind. I wish friendship came just as easily.
4 | I believe I'm always the smartest person in the room. And I'll prove it, even if no one asks me to.
5 | If these classes have taught me anything, it's that reality is a lie, and nothing matters. So why bother?
6 | Before I graduate, I want to achieve something mathematically impossible. I must leave a legacy!</text>

      <text>You have spent years practicing your writing and oration in the hope of becoming a student of Silverquill College. Your studies focus on language, literature, and the power of words, both magical and otherwise. The metaphorical power of words to illuminate or conceal is joined with the literal ability of magic to do the same in your academic pursuits.

Consider customizing how your spells look when you cast them. Your Silverquill spells might be accompanied by visual effects resembling splotches of ink or radiating ripples of golden light.
