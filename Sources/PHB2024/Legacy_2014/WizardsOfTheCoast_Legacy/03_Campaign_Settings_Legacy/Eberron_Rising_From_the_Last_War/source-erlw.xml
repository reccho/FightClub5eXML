  <description>Explore the lands of Eberron in this campaign sourcebook for the world's greatest roleplaying game.

This book provides everything players and Dungeon Masters need to play Dungeons &amp; Dragons in Eberron — a war-torn world filled with magic-fueled technology, airships and lightning trains, where noir-inspired mystery meets swashbuckling adventure. Will Eberron enter a prosperous new age or will the shadow of war descend once again?

	* Dive straight into your pulp adventures with easy-to-use locations, complete with maps of floating castles, skyscrapers, and more.
	* Explore Sharn, a city of skyscrapers, airships, and noirish intrigue and a crossroads for the world's war-ravaged peoples.
	* Include a campaign for characters venturing into the Mournland, a mist-cloaked, corpse-littered land twisted by magic.
	* Meld magic and invention to craft objects of wonder as an artificer—the first official class to be released for fifth edition D&amp;D since the Player's Handbook.
	* Flesh out your characters with a new D&amp;D game element called a group patron—a background for your whole party.
	* Explore 16 new race/subrace options including dragonmarks, which magically transform certain members of the races in the Player's Handbook.
	* Confront horrific monsters born from the world's devastating wars.</description>
