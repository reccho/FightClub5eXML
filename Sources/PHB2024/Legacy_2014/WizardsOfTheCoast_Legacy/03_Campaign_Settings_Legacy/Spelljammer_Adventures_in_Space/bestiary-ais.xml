        <description>Aartuks are intelligent plant creatures that live to wage war. Beholders destroyed their original home world and scattered the survivors across the Material Plane. These survivors formed small nomadic cells.

Aartuk cells can be found throughout Wildspace, including aboard spelljamming ships whose former crews were either murdered or forcibly ejected by a band of aartuks.

An aartuk's body is shaped like a five-pointed star and is covered with thick, flexible bark. The tips of its branch-like extremities end in suction cups that allow the creature to climb on vertical surfaces and along ceilings. Each suction cup houses three retractable pseudopods that are used to manipulate small objects.

The head of an aartuk surmounts a 6-foot-tall stalk that can be extruded from the center of the star. The head contains the aartuk's sensory organs, including a long tongue that the creature uses as a weapon.

An aartuk continues to grow throughout its long life. Aartuk elders can be as large as 12 feet in diameter.

An aartuk's preferred method of attack is to shoot forth its gooey tongue and use it to drag enemies to ward the center of its body so that it can batter them with its powerful branches. It can also spit pellets of radiant energy.

Aartuks have no deities of their own, but certain groups have adopted various gods of war and vengeance, including Gruumsh, Hextor, and Sargonnas.

The Aartuk language is made up of rustling sounds, snaps, pops, and hisses. It has no written form.

        <description>Lunar dragons (also known as moon dragons or phase dragons) are capricious, xenophobic creatures that make their lairs inside desolate moons by burrowing through the rock.

Before laying eggs, a female lunar dragon stocks her lair with food; she won't leave the lair again until the eggs hatch and the offspring are old enough to fend for themselves. Lunar dragon eggs have stony shells that are pale white to light gray in color. Lunar dragons are alabaster white when they hatch and gradually turn darker as they age. Ancient moon dragons are the color of slate.

Lunar dragons enjoy depriving other creatures of treasure more than acquiring the treasure themselves. Often found among the treasures in a lunar dragon's hoard are one or more spelljamming helms (see the Astral Adventurer's Guide) taken from vessels that dared to invade the dragon's territory.

A lunar dragon can become incorporeal, but not to the extent that it can pass through other creatures or solid objects. In this semi-incorppreal state, roughly half of the dragon's body has a dark, indistinctly spectral form.

A Lunar Dragon's Lair:
The cave complex where a lunar dragon makes its lair contains ample space for food, as well as one or more hidden chambers where the dragon keeps its treasure. Depending on the composition and features of the moon, the lair might contain natural springs and heat vents, wild gardens, crystal formations, magical phenomena, or an ecosystem of lesser life forms that have adapted to living with the dragon.

Regional Effects:
The region containing an ancient or adult lunar dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which produces one or more of the following effects:

	• Black Frost: A thin layer of black frost covers the ground, which kills all ordinary plants growing within 6 miles of the lair if the dragon is ancient, or within 3 miles if the dragon is an adult.

	• Haunting Moan: A haunting sound gets louder or fainter (dragon's choice) the closer one gets to the lair. The moan is audible 6 miles from the lair if the dragon is ancient, or 3 miles if the dragon is an adult.

	• Moon Devils: Swirling funnels of dust and frost known as moon devils crisscross the area within 1 mile of the lair, intercepting other creatures they encounter. A moon devil is a free-willed air elemental that deals cold damage instead of bludgeoning damage. If the dragon dies, the moaning stops, the moon devils dissipate, and the black frost disappears over the course of 1dlO days, allowing plant life in the area to recover.

        <description>A solar dragon (also known as a radiant dragon or a sun dragon) is born in the heart of a star. It divides its time outside its lair between patrolling its territory and hunting for food. The dragon has a serpentine body, a pair of ventral limbs ending in long fins, nebulous wings that give off light, and gleaming, multicolored scales. It can see clearly even in blindingly bright light.

Solar dragons are fond of treasure just as all dragons are, but in the airless void of Wildspace, they value food even more. Solar dragons typically feed on kindori, scavvers, and other forms of space-dwelling wildlife. A solar dragon might mistake a distant spelljamming ship for possible prey and come within range of the vessel's weapons before realizing its error and veering away. A wise or experienced captain won't take the dragon's approach as a sign of hostility. Solar dragons that are fired upon have been known to batter the offending ships to flinders.

Solar dragons are territorial carnivores, and they behave accordingly. A young solar dragon might lay claim to an asteroid belt, where food is relatively plentiful, while an ancient solar dragon might consider an entire Wildspace system its hunting
ground. They tend to give a wide berth to Humanoid folk, whom they find violent and tiresome. Trespassers who are detected in a solar dragon's lair can expect to be met with resistance, followed by hostility, especially if the lair contains eggs.

A solar dragon egg has an obsidian shell, shiny black and opaque. When an egg is close to hatching, the shell becomes translucent, allowing the light from the unborn wyrmling's wings to shine through.

A Solar Dragon's Lair:
A solar dragon customarily lairs in a star's radiant core or nests in a gigantic, hollowed-out rock engulfed by the star's blinding radiance. A star in which a solar dragon makes its lair has the following effects on creatures:

	• Blinding Radiance: A creature that is within 10 miles of the star or inside it is blinded by its intense light unless the creature has protective gear to shield its eyes, such as goggles of night or a similar form of eyewear.

	• Stellar Incineration: Any creature that enters the star or starts its turn inside it takes 132 (24d10) radiant damage. Source:	Spelljammer: Adventures in Space - Boo's Astral Menagerie p. 52</description>

        <description>The following rules apply to Agony the ghost:

	• As long as the Last Breath has at least 1 hit point, the ghost can't be permanently slain. If the ghost is reduced to 0 hit points and the ship has at least 1 hit point, the ghost re-forms 24 hours later in the ship's cargo hold with all its hit points.

	• If it moves more than 100 feet from the Last Breath, the ghost disappears and instantly reappears in the ship's cargo hold.

	• While away from the Last Breath, the ghost can use a bonus action to magically teleport back to the ship, either to the lower cargo hold (area 13 on the space galleon deck plans) or a location it can see.

        <description>Lunar dragons (also known as moon dragons or phase dragons) are capricious, xenophobic creatures that make their lairs inside desolate moons by burrowing through the rock.

Before laying eggs, a female lunar dragon stocks her lair with food; she won't leave the lair again until the eggs hatch and the offspring are old enough to fend for themselves. Lunar dragon eggs have stony shells that are pale white to light gray in color. Lunar dragons are alabaster white when they hatch and gradually turn darker as they age. Ancient moon dragons are the color of slate.

Lunar dragons enjoy depriving other creatures of treasure more than acquiring the treasure themselves. Often found among the treasures in a lunar dragon's hoard are one or more spelljamming helms (see the Astral Adventurer's Guide) taken from vessels that dared to invade the dragon's territory.

A lunar dragon can become incorporeal, but not to the extent that it can pass through other creatures or solid objects. In this semi-incorppreal state, roughly half of the dragon's body has a dark, indistinctly spectral form.

A Lunar Dragon's Lair:
The cave complex where a lunar dragon makes its lair contains ample space for food, as well as one or more hidden chambers where the dragon keeps its treasure. Depending on the composition and features of the moon, the lair might contain natural springs and heat vents, wild gardens, crystal formations, magical phenomena, or an ecosystem of lesser life forms that have adapted to living with the dragon.

Regional Effects:
The region containing an ancient or adult lunar dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which produces one or more of the following effects:

	• Black Frost: A thin layer of black frost covers the ground, which kills all ordinary plants growing within 6 miles of the lair if the dragon is ancient, or within 3 miles if the dragon is an adult.

	• Haunting Moan: A haunting sound gets louder or fainter (dragon's choice) the closer one gets to the lair. The moan is audible 6 miles from the lair if the dragon is ancient, or 3 miles if the dragon is an adult.

	• Moon Devils: Swirling funnels of dust and frost known as moon devils crisscross the area within 1 mile of the lair, intercepting other creatures they encounter. A moon devil is a free-willed air elemental that deals cold damage instead of bludgeoning damage. If the dragon dies, the moaning stops, the moon devils dissipate, and the black frost disappears over the course of 1dlO days, allowing plant life in the area to recover.

        <description>A solar dragon (also known as a radiant dragon or a sun dragon) is born in the heart of a star. It divides its time outside its lair between patrolling its territory and hunting for food. The dragon has a serpentine body, a pair of ventral limbs ending in long fins, nebulous wings that give off light, and gleaming, multicolored scales. It can see clearly even in blindingly bright light.

Solar dragons are fond of treasure just as all dragons are, but in the airless void of Wildspace, they value food even more. Solar dragons typically feed on kindori, scavvers, and other forms of space-dwelling wildlife. A solar dragon might mistake a distant spelljamming ship for possible prey and come within range of the vessel's weapons before realizing its error and veering away. A wise or experienced captain won't take the dragon's approach as a sign of hostility. Solar dragons that are fired upon have been known to batter the offending ships to flinders.

Solar dragons are territorial carnivores, and they behave accordingly. A young solar dragon might lay claim to an asteroid belt, where food is relatively plentiful, while an ancient solar dragon might consider an entire Wildspace system its hunting
ground. They tend to give a wide berth to Humanoid folk, whom they find violent and tiresome. Trespassers who are detected in a solar dragon's lair can expect to be met with resistance, followed by hostility, especially if the lair contains eggs.

A solar dragon egg has an obsidian shell, shiny black and opaque. When an egg is close to hatching, the shell becomes translucent, allowing the light from the unborn wyrmling's wings to shine through.

A Solar Dragon's Lair:
A solar dragon customarily lairs in a star's radiant core or nests in a gigantic, hollowed-out rock engulfed by the star's blinding radiance. A star in which a solar dragon makes its lair has the following effects on creatures:

	• Blinding Radiance: A creature that is within 10 miles of the star or inside it is blinded by its intense light unless the creature has protective gear to shield its eyes, such as goggles of night or a similar form of eyewear.

	• Stellar Incineration: Any creature that enters the star or starts its turn inside it takes 132 (24d10) radiant damage. Source:	Spelljammer: Adventures in Space - Boo's Astral Menagerie p. 50</description>

        <description>Long ago, some elves ventured to the Astral Plane to be closer to their gods. There, they ceased to age and could exist indefinitely without sustenance.

Astral elves were among the first creatures to dwell in the Silver Void. As other explorers have reached for the stars, astral elves have had to reckon with violent neighbors and strange visitors. Over the eons, astral elves have clashed with numerous invaders, including psurlons, mind flayers, and githyanki. When dealing with others, astral elves customarily cover their faces with ornate visors, becoming faceless extensions of their gods. Their fierce devotion to the pantheon of elven deities is repaid with divine power. For example, the gods invest astral elf warriors with the power to channel the radiant energy of starlight through their weapons, just as they empower astral elf leaders with the ability to cast spells and summon solar dragons.

Astral elves ply the Astral Sea and Wildspace in ships of their own design. These ships are fashioned from crystals harvested from Wildspace systems and bound together with an organic, plant-based material that hardens like ceramic. The elves sculpt these substances in various configurations to create star moths (see the Astral Adventurer's Guide) and other vessels. The elves also reshape the petrified bodies of dead gods found adrift in the Silver Void, transforming them into floating cities and citadels.

Although the Silver Void is their home, astral elves often venture into Wildspace systems and place their ships and citadels in orbit around stars. Astral elves do this for several reasons. Proximity to a star allows the astral elves to forge pacts with solar dragons and to collect starlight, which the elves use to grow crystals and repair their ships. Most important, astral elves use their time outside the Deep Astral to replenish their numbers by having and raising children.

Many astral elves are thousands (in some cases tens of thousands) of years old. Whatever their disposition, their longevity gives astral elves a perspective on time that few other kinds of creatures can appreciate. Whether they choose to live in quiet contemplation or strike out to explore the far reaches of the multiverse, astral elves tend to see events happening elsewhere as having little or no meaning to them.

An astral elf aristocrat is a brilliant, highborn leader gifted with magical abilities, including the power to channel sunlight and summon a solar dragon.

        <description>Long ago, some elves ventured to the Astral Plane to be closer to their gods. There, they ceased to age and could exist indefinitely without sustenance.

Astral elves were among the first creatures to dwell in the Silver Void. As other explorers have reached for the stars, astral elves have had to reckon with violent neighbors and strange visitors. Over the eons, astral elves have clashed with numerous invaders, including psurlons, mind flayers, and githyanki. When dealing with others, astral elves customarily cover their faces with ornate visors, becoming faceless extensions of their gods. Their fierce devotion to the pantheon of elven deities is repaid with divine power. For example, the gods invest astral elf warriors with the power to channel the radiant energy of starlight through their weapons, just as they empower astral elf leaders with the ability to cast spells and summon solar dragons.

Astral elves ply the Astral Sea and Wildspace in ships of their own design. These ships are fashioned from crystals harvested from Wildspace systems and bound together with an organic, plant-based material that hardens like ceramic. The elves sculpt these substances in various configurations to create star moths (see the Astral Adventurer's Guide) and other vessels. The elves also reshape the petrified bodies of dead gods found adrift in the Silver Void, transforming them into floating cities and citadels.

Although the Silver Void is their home, astral elves often venture into Wildspace systems and place their ships and citadels in orbit around stars. Astral elves do this for several reasons. Proximity to a star allows the astral elves to forge pacts with solar dragons and to collect starlight, which the elves use to grow crystals and repair their ships. Most important, astral elves use their time outside the Deep Astral to replenish their numbers by having and raising children.

Many astral elves are thousands (in some cases tens of thousands) of years old. Whatever their disposition, their longevity gives astral elves a perspective on time that few other kinds of creatures can appreciate. Whether they choose to live in quiet contemplation or strike out to explore the far reaches of the multiverse, astral elves tend to see events happening elsewhere as having little or no meaning to them.

An astral elf commander leads warriors into battle and usually has one or more spelljamming ships under their command. A commander channels the radiant energy of starlight through their weapons, and they can rescue warriors from a perilous situation by using their gods-given power of teleportation.

The safety of important individuals and locations is entrusted to astral elf honor guards, highly trained warriors who are more than capable of holding their own in combat.

Star priests draw their strength from the pantheon of elven gods and oversee religious practices in astral elf society. It's common for them to serve aboard spelljamming ships, not only as emissaries of the gods but also as spelljammers.

        <description>An autognome is a mechanical gnome that resembles the rock gnome who created it, though it could never be mistaken for a gnome. Regardless of what its insides are made of, it has a metallic outer casing painted with gnomish features. It walks with a stiff gait, clanking, wheezing, whirring, and buzzing wherever it goes.

An autognome obeys its creator's commands when it is functioning properly, but a design flaw can cause an autognome to go rogue, forget its orders, and wander Wildspace doing anything except what it was designed for.

No two autognomes are necessarily made of the same materials; magic is what gives them their intelligence. Most autognomes are programmed to obey the following three directives: defend gnomes who are being attacked by non-gnomes, defend yourself if you are attacked, and protect infants and youngsters from harm. The last directive arose from the best intentions, but it doesn't distinguish between species; if an autognome sees a group of adults battling a lunar dragon wyrmling, for instance, it would come to the wyrmling's defense.

11-12: "My Mind Is Going. I Can Feel It." The autognome is incapacitated for 1 minute.

15-16: "Who Turned Out the Lights?" The autognome's head falls off and deactivates, causing the autognome to be blinded and deafened until a creature uses an action to reattach the head, which reactivates it.
17-20: "Have a Magical Day!" The autognome explodes and is destroyed. Each creature within 20 feet of the exploding autognome must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>

        <description>B'rohgs are broad-shouldered, four-armed Giants, 15 feet tall, with burnt-orange skin. They have fiat
noses, pointed ears, and long hair that grows down the backs and sides of their otherwise bald heads. They wear simple garb and like to hurl heavy rocks. A b'rohg can wield a weapon with each of its four arms, but it prefers to pound enemies with its fists and rip smaller creatures apart with its bare hands.

B'rohgs communicate with one another using grunts and basic hand signals; they have no spoken or written language. They prefer to be left alone and for that reason don't normally pose a threat to smaller creatures. Because of their size and strength, they are popular attractions in gladiatorial arenas, where they are coerced into fighting for food.

B'rohgs are accustomed to eking out a meager existence in their natural habitat, and they rarely bond with other kinds of creatures. A b'rohg that benefits from a stranger's act of kindness is at first puzzled by the effort, then wary. If this kindness is sufficient to earn the creature's trust, the b'rohg will try to repay the stranger, perhaps by carrying their gear or helping them navigate perilous terrain. A solitary b'rohg that is befriended by a group of adventurers might follow them around for a while, but it will soon tire of their company and once again seek out others of its own kind.

        <description>Scavvers are shark-like scavengers that fly through space, feeding on whatever they can fit in their mouths. Scavvers are not always aggressive; often they trail behind larger creatures as well as ships and asteroids, living off droppings and discarded refuse. They can enter the air envelopes of these bodies, so that as their "host" moves (often at high speed), the scavvers keep pace. The lesser varieties-brown and gray-rarely rise above the level of nuisances. The larger varieties are more formidable, in part because they often don't wait for their meals to come to them.

A scavver has a single large eye in the leading edge of its head. This eye glows while the creature is awake. Its wide mouth is full of sharp teeth. A scavver flies in lazy circles when it sleeps but otherwise moves through space much as a shark swims through water.

Void scavvers are 20 feet long. Each one is a solitary menace with a pitch-black hide. While most other scavvers are content to feed on kitchen scraps, a void scavver goes after the cook.

A void scavver can emit an invisible ray from its eye that causes its target to feel fear even more intense than what it might normally experience given the creature's size and nature.

        <description>A braxat is a towering, warm-blooded carnivore with a thick, articulated shell covering its back, a squarish head topped with horny protrusions, and thick arms ending in large hands with opposable thumbs. The creature walks upright on two legs and speaks in a voice similar to that of a human.

Braxats hunt alone or in pairs, prowling deserts, dry canyons, desolate wastelands, and lonely asteroids in search of prey. Braxats also spew acid, though they tend to do so only as a last resort, since the acid dissolves and ruins the flesh they crave.

A braxat projects an invisible psychic barrier around itself that enhances its natural armor, and it can amplify this magical energy to create shields of rippling force that deflect incoming attacks and absorb magic missile spells.

Brown scavvers are 10 feet long and range in color from sun-dappled brownish gold to dark umber. It takes them days to digest a meal, during which time they attack only in self-defense.

A brown scavver likes to swallow its prey whole. The creature's stomach is filled with poisonous gas, which kills off anything that survives being swallowed.

        <description>Chwingas are tiny elemental spirits that adapt easily to any habitable environment. These gentle creatures protect nature, considering themselves as its humble custodians. Chwingas live inside plants, rocks, and springs far from civilization.

Chwingas resemble 6-inch-tall, animated dolls with mask-like faces, spindly limbs, and wild hair. They don't have names and can't speak.

Chwingas normally avoid other creatures, but they find the trappings of civilization fascinating. They puzzle over creatures that wear armor, carry weapons, use tools, and cook food. When a chwinga encounters one or more such creatures, its curiosity compels it to shadow them for a short time and observe them. If it takes a liking to a particular creature, a chwinga uses its cantrips to aid that creature, or bestows upon it a magical gift before departing. The features that attract a chwinga to a particular creature vary. A chwinga might like the way a certain creature walks or the way it combs its hair, or be smitten by its ability to play music or to eat copious amounts of food.

Chwingas that live in Wildspace usually dwell on habitable moons and asteroids, though they occasionally stow away on spelljamming ships or ride around on space guppies. Using its Magical Gift ability, a chwinga astronaut can bestow one of the following charms in place of those described in the Dungeon Master's Guide.


Charm of Air Bubbles:
This charm allows you to cast the air bubble spell as an action. Once used three times, this charm goes away.

Charm of Instant Tools:
This charm allows you to magically conjure a set of artisan's tools, navigator's tools, or thieves' tools. The conjured tools appear either in your hand or somewhere else in your space (your choice). Once used, this charm goes away, but the tools remain.

        <description>It's easy to spot giff in a room: these burly folk are 7-foot-tall, hippopotamus-headed people. In Wildspace and its associated ports, giff are most often encountered as spacefaring mercenaries. These troops are renowned for their martial training and love of explosives and are typically armed with gleaming firearms.

Every aspect of these spacefaring giff's society is organized along military lines. From birth until death, each has a military rank. Promotions don't depend on time in service but are granted by superiors as rewards for valor.

Muskets and grenades are the specialties of many giff regiments. The bigger the boom, the brighter the flash, and the thicker the smoke it produces, the greater the glory for the one wielding the weapon.

Giff shipmates, who make up the bulk of the crew on most giff vessels, are disciplined sailors.

Characters who venture to the Happy Beholder can find Commodore Krux there, day or night, nursing a hefty flagon of ale

Krux is a lawful good giff shipmate (see Boo's Astral Menagerie), a soldier who believes his glory days are behind him. Krux has spent the last few years working as a mercenary on and around the Rock of Bral, but lately the giff has been spending more time in his cups as new jobs have become fewer and farther between. The parrot perched on Krux's shoulder isn't his; the bird belongs to Large Luigi, the tavern's beholder proprietor. Luigi uses the parrot to help cheer up downtrodden patrons.

        <description>Cosmic horrors are colossal, malevolent entities that occasionally slip the bonds of the Far Realm and find themselves adrift on the Astral Plane. Drawn to the light of distant stars, these creatures invade Wildspace systems and lay waste to worlds. After feeding on the minds and bodies of a world's inhabitants until it is sated, a cosmic horror usually returns to the void, where it falls into a deep sleep, drifting aimlessly until hunger or some other stimulus awakens it.

Cosmic horrors are among the most powerful creatures spawned by the Far Realm. No two of them have the same appearance, but they have certain qualities in common. Each one is roughly 100 feet long or tall, and its physical form is a seemingly impossible conglomeration of eyes, mouths, wings, tentacles, and less recognizable organs and appendages.

        <description>Dohwars are short, pudgy, flightless avians that look and move like penguins. They are inveterate merchants, always looking for an opportunity to turn a profit. Dohwars conduct their dealings in secrecy, preferring to do business in dark alleys and out-of-the-way places even when the items being bought or sold aren't illegal or dangerous. They tend to dress in a garish mishmash of clothing, but many of them also shroud themselves in hooded cloaks. A group of dohwars is called a cartel.

The average dohwar stands 3 feet tall and has bright plumage. Instead of wings, it has arms and tiny hands.

Dohwars prefer to communicate through a form of telepathy they call merging, in which two dohwars stay in mental contact while both are telepathically linked with a third creature.

Dohwars have their own pantheon of deities, made up entirely of gods of commerce and wealth. These deities include Waukeen, Abbathor, and Zilchus. By focusing on the worship of such deities, the dohwars hope to become the best merchants in the multiverse without alienating or offending any god in particular.

        <description>An esthetic is a biological, symbiotic creation of a reigar. It is essentially an organic ship with only the barest hint of awareness. Without its reigar to guide it, an esthetic becomes a nearly mindless entity with an instinct for self-preservation.

Reigar use their esthetics as spelljamming warships. When a hostile reigar in its esthetic encounters another spacefaring vessel, it uses a magical vibration to disable the ship's spelljamming helm. The reigar then commands the esthetic to grapple members of the ship's crew and dissolve their flesh with its acid-secreting tentacles.

Each esthetic is unique in appearance. One might be bilaterally symmetrical (two matching halves, like a humanoid body along its vertical axis), radially symmetrical (like a starfish), or have no definable shape. From a distance, an esthetic is easily mistaken for a giant, space-dwelling jellyfish or cephalopod. Its outer shell is made of bioluminescent resin.

An esthetic contains enough interior space to comfortably accommodate its reigar host and up to six Medium passengers. Access is gained through a hatch that the reigar (and no one else) can open or close with a touch.

An esthetic can survive indefinitely on the Astral Plane, provided its creator is alive. If the esthetic's creator dies, the esthetic sickens over a period of 1d12 days and then expires.

        <description>When its large eye and mouth are closed, an eye monger looks like nothing more than a 12-foot-diameter asteroid. When it senses vibrations in the space around it, the eye monger opens its eye and reveals its true, menacing nature.

An eye monger has no use for treasure, but its belly might hold a fair amount of incidental valuables that it can't digest, including coins, metal weapons, gemstones, and magic items that belonged to the creatures it swallowed.

Although an eye monger doesn't project an antimagic cone from its eye as a beholder does, magic is suppressed inside its gullet, which prevents a swallowed creature from using magic to escape.

The eye monger can swallow one creature at a time. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, has total cover against attacks and other effects originating outside the eye monger, and takes 35 (10d6) acid damage at the start of each of its turns.

If the eye monger takes 25 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside its gullet, the eye monger regurgitates the swallowed creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the eye monger. If the eye monger dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.</text>

        <description>A feyr (pronounced "fear") is a tentacled horror that feeds quietly on strong emotions. To minimize the chance of harm to itself, it prefers to devour the nightmares of other creatures while they sleep.

Feyrs shun bright light but aren't harmed by it. Consequently, they are as much at home in the void of Wildspace as they are in dark alleys and dungeons. A feyr that comes across a spelljamming ship tries to enter the ship's air envelope and stow away, remaining secluded and invisible until it finds a sleeping victim it can attack. It retreats rather than allows itself to perish in a confrontation.

        <description>Gaj are hideous hunters that prey on other intelligent life forms. They crawl on six insectile legs and attack with their mandibles. They ambush prey by burying themselves under sand or silt and lying in wait, lurking in dark caves, or perching on natural stone ledges, where they blend in with their surroundings. Gaj have no language, but they have the magical ability to understand the speech of other creatures.

A gaj's head is a spongy globe about 2 feet in diameter, with three feathery antennae protruding from the top. Spaced around the head are six compound eyes, and six finger-like appendages hang over its mouth. A gaj can try to read the thoughts of another intelligent creature by wrapping its antennae around the creature's head. Regardless of whether the attempt succeeds, this mental probe is painful and takes a toll on the victim's well-being.

        <description>Space hamsters resemble their terrestrial kin, both in their appearance and general demeanor, and they come in a variety of colors.

Giant space hamsters are cute, plant-eating rodents as big as brown bears. They tend to avoid other creatures, especially threatening ones, but they can be trained to serve as mounts and beasts of burden. Gnomes have tried to build spelljamming ships powered by giant space hamster wheels, so far without success.

        <description>It's easy to spot giff in a room: these burly folk are 7-foot-tall, hippopotamus-headed people. In Wildspace and its associated ports, giff are most often encountered as spacefaring mercenaries. These troops are renowned for their martial training and love of explosives and are typically armed with gleaming firearms.

Every aspect of these spacefaring giff's society is organized along military lines. From birth until death, each has a military rank. Promotions don't depend on time in service but are granted by superiors as rewards for valor.

Muskets and grenades are the specialties of many giff regiments. The bigger the boom, the brighter the flash, and the thicker the smoke it produces, the greater the glory for the one wielding the weapon.

Giff shipmates, who make up the bulk of the crew on most giff vessels, are disciplined sailors.

A giff shock trooper is trained to mount assaults on enemy strongholds. Each one is adept at softening up the enemy from a distance with firearms before charging into melee to mop up the foes that remain standing.

Muskets and grenades are the specialties of many giff regiments. The bigger the boom, the brighter the flash, and the thicker the smoke it produces, the greater the glory for the one wielding the weapon.

A high-ranking giff who takes up the life of an independent mercenary might amass enough power and influence to become a warlord.

A giff warlord usually commands a small fleet of spelljamming ships and operates out of a heavily defended stronghold. Anyone who shares the warlord's ideology-whatever it might be-is eligible to join the ranks of the warlord's army, which is mainly made up of mages who helm the ships of the fleet and provide magical firepower, sellswords of various species, and guns for hire in the form of giff shock troopers.

The Monster Manual and Monsters of the Multiverse contain a variety of githyanki for your use. This section provides additional options.

Githyanki buccaneers ply the Astral Plane for riches, which they haul back to their hidden fortresses in the Deep Astral. Many of them are warriors who lost the will to serve the Lich-Queen Vlaakith; they prefer to live by their own code or revel in their unbridled freedom.

The Monster Manual and Monsters of the Multiverse contain a variety of githyanki for your use. This section provides additional options.

Githyanki star seers believe that the stars are the eyes of the multiverse. They use their magic to contact ancient stellar entities such as Acamar, Caiphon, and Hadar, hoping to learn their secrets, then record these secrets in journals. They scour Wildspace in search of new entities as well, hoping to be the first to contact them.

Some of the secrets learned are so cryptic that they require years of research to decipher, but time is of little concern to a star seer, who resides mainly on the Astral Plane.

        <description>Githyanki descend from an ancient people who were also the progenitors of githzerai. These tall, gaunt folk have potent psionic powers and dwell, for the most part, on the Astral Plane. Among the best-known githyanki are the followers of the Lich-Queen Vlaakith. They terrorize the Astral Plane, raiding into Wildspace to plunder the multiverse of its magic and riches.

The Monster Manual and Monsters of the Multiverse contain a variety of githyanki for your use. This section provides additional options.

A githyanki xenomancer travels to the farthest reaches of Wildspace and the Astral Sea, even visiting worlds of the Material Plane from time to time, to study and catalog creatures it has never encountered before. Friendly contact with sapient creatures can bring the xenomancer's diplomatic skills to the forefront, while hostile contact becomes a test of the xenomancer's survival skills.

Sometimes a xenomancer's research requires that a specimen be captured and imprisoned (to study its behavior) or killed and dissected (to study or harvest its insides). Many xenomancers prefer to do this work in their laboratories on the Astral Plane.

        <description>Scavvers are shark-like scavengers that fly through space, feeding on whatever they can fit in their mouths. Scavvers are not always aggressive; often they trail behind larger creatures as well as ships and asteroids, living off droppings and discarded refuse. They can enter the air envelopes of these bodies, so that as their "host" moves (often at high speed), the scavvers keep pace. The lesser varieties-brown and gray-rarely rise above the level of nuisances. The larger varieties are more formidable, in part because they often don't wait for their meals to come to them.

A scavver has a single large eye in the leading edge of its head. This eye glows while the creature is awake. Its wide mouth is full of sharp teeth. A scavver flies in lazy circles when it sleeps but otherwise moves through space much as a shark swims through water.

Gray scavvers are 6 feet long and travel in packs. The scent of blood sends them into a feeding frenzy, but wounding one usually weakens it enough to make it break off its attack.

        <description>Hadozees are slender, highly adaptive Humanoids with simian features and their own language. Their feet are fully as dexterous as their hands, even to the extent of having toes that serve as opposable thumbs. Membranes of skin hang loosely from their arms and legs. When stretched taut between outstretched limbs, these membranes enable a hadozee to glide.

On Yazir, their home world, hadozees lived high up in the trees to avoid large predators that walk on land. Today, Wildspace is where most of them feel at home. Hadozees are often hired as mercenary crews by other spacefaring folk. Their natural climbing ability comes in handy, as does their ability to glide. A hadozee accustomed to space travel knows how to use a ship's gravity plane to its advantage in combat, by diving off one side of the ship, gliding under the keel, and appearing on the opposite side of
the ship from where it leapt off.

Hadozee explorers scour Wildspace systems for riches and adventure. They often serve as navigators aboard spelljamming ships. To them, the Astral Plane is a mostly uncharted expanse worthy of further exploration.

        <description>A jammer leech is a barnacle-like creature that begins life as a space-dwelling spore that attaches to the hull of a spelljamming ship, with the leech inside in larval form. A spore that remains attached to a ship for a few days punctures the hull and begins to develop a hard shell that roughly matches the color of the hull. The shell is affixed to the ship by a glue-like substance secreted by the leech. The shell grows until it's about 1 foot in diameter. The leech inside is reddish-purple in color, with a body resembling that of a snail. It has a single watery eye at one end and a spiked tentacle protruding from just below the eye, which it uses to defend itself.

A mated pair of leeches produces 1d6 spores every month. Some of these spores might join their parents on the hull of the ship, while others float off, waiting to attach themselves to another unwary vessel.

A jammer leech damages the hull of the ship to which it is attached and absorbs magic from the ship's spelljamming helm. It can discharge this magic from time to time as a defensive measure. If the crew of a ship becomes aware of leeches that have become attached, it's customary for them to try to scrape the leeches off the hull rather than attack them with weapons. Killing a leech while it is attached to the ship is dangerous, because the trauma of its death can be felt by the ship's spelljammer, who is weakened and incapacitated by the shock.

        <description>Kindori are among the largest creatures found in Wildspace. They resemble aquatic whales in general shape and are mammals as well. An adult specimen can be up to 80 feet long.

A kindori lacks a noticeable mouth. The leading edge of its body is dotted with small eyes that can emit bright beams of light, which the creature uses to blind predators before making its escape. Kindori communicate with one another over long distances by sending flashes of light from their eyes and draw their nourishment from the light of suns and stars.

A kindori is large enough to have its own gravity plane and air envelope, enabling smaller creatures to live and travel on its body. Mosses, molds, and other parasitic organisms grow on its surface, which in turn attract predators to clean them off. A kindori might have scavvers feeding on these parasites, which it doesn't mind. An extremely old or sick kindori can be identified by the overgrowth of vines and vegetation on it.

The bones and cartilage of a dead kindori do not deteriorate after parasites devour the creature's flesh. A kindori skeleton can be transformed into a spelljamming ship by placing a spelljamming helm
inside it.

Kindori are peaceful creatures but have many natural enemies, including lunar dragons, solar dragons, and various peoples that inhabit Wildspace.

        <description>Lunar dragons (also known as moon dragons or phase dragons) are capricious, xenophobic creatures that make their lairs inside desolate moons by burrowing through the rock.

Before laying eggs, a female lunar dragon stocks her lair with food; she won't leave the lair again until the eggs hatch and the offspring are old enough to fend for themselves. Lunar dragon eggs have stony shells that are pale white to light gray in color. Lunar dragons are alabaster white when they hatch and gradually turn darker as they age. Ancient moon dragons are the color of slate.

Lunar dragons enjoy depriving other creatures of treasure more than acquiring the treasure themselves. Often found among the treasures in a lunar dragon's hoard are one or more spelljamming helms (see the Astral Adventurer's Guide) taken from vessels that dared to invade the dragon's territory.

A lunar dragon can become incorporeal, but not to the extent that it can pass through other creatures or solid objects. In this semi-incorppreal state, roughly half of the dragon's body has a dark, indistinctly spectral form.

A Lunar Dragon's Lair:
The cave complex where a lunar dragon makes its lair contains ample space for food, as well as one or more hidden chambers where the dragon keeps its treasure. Depending on the composition and features of the moon, the lair might contain natural springs and heat vents, wild gardens, crystal formations, magical phenomena, or an ecosystem of lesser life forms that have adapted to living with the dragon.

Regional Effects:
The region containing an ancient or adult lunar dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which produces one or more of the following effects:

	• Black Frost: A thin layer of black frost covers the ground, which kills all ordinary plants growing within 6 miles of the lair if the dragon is ancient, or within 3 miles if the dragon is an adult.

	• Haunting Moan: A haunting sound gets louder or fainter (dragon's choice) the closer one gets to the lair. The moan is audible 6 miles from the lair if the dragon is ancient, or 3 miles if the dragon is an adult.

	• Moon Devils: Swirling funnels of dust and frost known as moon devils crisscross the area within 1 mile of the lair, intercepting other creatures they encounter. A moon devil is a free-willed air elemental that deals cold damage instead of bludgeoning damage. If the dragon dies, the moaning stops, the moon devils dissipate, and the black frost disappears over the course of 1dlO days, allowing plant life in the area to recover.

        <description>Megapedes are enormous centipedes that can be as much as 150 feet long, though most specimens top out at between 100 and 120 feet. Their dozens of legs are each 5 feet long and tipped with flexible claws, and they have fur-covered carapaces. A megapede that lives in a sandy environment often buries itself in the sand and waits for prey to wander nearby, but megapedes also nest in cavernous underground chambers.

A megapede's bite is poisonous. In addition, the creature has magical abilities that make it a superior predator. It can exude an invisible aura of life-draining energy, or it can fix its gaze on one creature and implant a psychic bomb in that creature's mind.

After a megapede lays eggs, it attaches the eggs to its body using sticky saliva and carries them on its back until the eggs hatch. Newly hatched megapedes grow to full size within weeks by consuming as much as they can, possibly including one another if food is scarce.

        <description>Mercanes are merchants who trade primarily in magic items and advanced technology, including artifacts and spelljamming helms. These 12-foot tall, lanky, blue giants dress in elegant robes and have elongated heads and long, spindly fingers. They use spelljamming ships to cross the Astral Sea and travel from world to world within Wildspace systems, where they conduct most of their business. It's rare to see more than one mercane at a time, though it's common for a mercane to be accompanied by underlings or bodyguards.

Mercanes will conduct business with anyone, fairly and reliably, provided the other party has neither harmed nor swindled another mercane in the past. Mercanes have a special form of telepathy that enables them to communicate with one another across the multiverse. A mercane often uses this ability to warn another mercanes about individuals who are dangerous or unreliable. Once a mercane has been offended by someone, getting back into their good graces is next to impossible.

        <description>Evil spellcasters create murder comets by combining the essence of earth elementals with that of fire elementals. A murder comet looks like a screaming stone head wreathed in flame. It trails fire behind it as it flies through Wildspace, either singly or in a posse with other murder comets, looking for ships, crews, and other unsuspecting targets to destroy.

A murder comet's creator can bind their spirit to the comet. In this form, the comet's creator becomes ageless and immortal, free to race across Wildspace without need for air, sleep, or sustenance. The murder comet's face takes on the appearance of its creator's, and its statistics change as follows:

	• Replace the comet's Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores with those of its creator.

	• Replace the comet's alignment and languages with those of its creator.

        <description>Known throughout the multiverse as brain collectors, neh-thalggu consume the brains of Humanoids and use them as receptacles to enhance their magical abilities.

Neh-thalggu are born in the nightmarish Far Realm, but they spread across the Astral Plane and find their way onto the various worlds of the Material Plane, where brains are much more abundant. A neh-thalggu has a bulbous body and six legs resembling those of a crustacean. Four bulging eyes and a tooth-filled maw dominate its hideous visage. Behind and above these features, one or more lumps protrude from its body, each one containing a brain the neh-thalggu has consumed.

After a neh-thalggu kills a victim, it uses its pincers to cut open the victim's head and remove the brain. It then swallows the brain whole. The collected brain is stored inside one of several pockets in the neh-thalggu's head. Once it has collected twelve brains in this fashion, it is overcome by an urge to return to the Far Realm and begins devoting all its energy to finding a way home.

In an encounter with a neh-thalggu, roll a d12 to determine how many brains it has already collected.

        <description>A neogi looks like an outsize spider with an eel's neck and head. It can poison the body and the mind of its targets and can subjugate even beings that are physically superior.

Neogi usually dwell in far-flung locations on the Material Plane, as well as on the Astral Plane and the Ethereal Plane. They left their home world long ago to conquer and devour creatures in other realms. During this era, they dominated umber hulks and used them to build sleek, spidery ships capable of traversing the multiverse.

A neogi lives about a century. When an individual is rendered weak by advanced age, the other neogi in the group overpower it and inject it with a special poison. The toxin transforms the old neogi into a bloated mass of flesh. Younger neogi lay their eggs atop it, and when the hatchlings emerge, they devour the old neogi and one another until only a few of the strongest newborns are left. Sometimes the newborns, united by a singular evil purpose, coalesce into a skittering swarm instead.

        <description>A neogi looks like an outsize spider with an eel's neck and head. It can poison the body and the mind of its targets and can subjugate even beings that are physically superior.

Neogi usually dwell in far-flung locations on the Material Plane, as well as on the Astral Plane and the Ethereal Plane. They left their home world long ago to conquer and devour creatures in other realms. During this era, they dominated umber hulks and used them to build sleek, spidery ships capable of traversing the multiverse.

Neogi pirates are adult neogi that serve as crew members aboard nightspiders (see the Astral Adventurer's Guide) and other neogi-controlled vessels.

Neogi society makes no distinction between individuals, aside from the ability that a given creature has to control others, and they don't comprehend the emotional aspects of existence that humans and similar beings experience. To a neogi, hatred is as foreign a sensation as love, and showing loyalty in the absence of authority is foolishness.

Neogi pirates (and adult neogi in general) mark themselves and those they capture through the use of dyes, transformational magic, and other markings intended to signify rank, achievements, and the identity of the individual's leader. By these signs, neogi can identify each other's place in the hierarchy-and they must defer to those of higher station or risk harsh punishment.

A neogi void hunter is bigger than a typical adult neogi and often fills the role of captain aboard a nightspider (see the Astral Adventurer's Guide). The void hunter pledges fealty to one or more stellar entities in exchange for a taste of their immense power. These entities-known by such names as Acamar, Caiphon, Gibbeth, and Hadar-resemble stars and embody the essence of evil.

        <description>Scavvers are shark-like scavengers that fly through space, feeding on whatever they can fit in their mouths. Scavvers are not always aggressive; often they trail behind larger creatures as well as ships and asteroids, living off droppings and discarded refuse. They can enter the air envelopes of these bodies, so that as their "host" moves (often at high speed), the scavvers keep pace. The lesser varieties-brown and gray-rarely rise above the level of nuisances. The larger varieties are more formidable, in part because they often don't wait for their meals to come to them.

A scavver has a single large eye in the leading edge of its head. This eye glows while the creature is awake. Its wide mouth is full of sharp teeth. A scavver flies in lazy circles when it sleeps but otherwise moves through space much as a shark swims through water.

Night scavvers are 15 feet long. Their coloration resembles that of Wildspace itself: white spots (representing stars) sprinkled amid dark patches and patterns of color. They fearlessly invade the air envelopes of spelljamming ships and attack crew members on deck.

Cooked night scavver meat is a popular offering in taverns across Wildspace.

        <description>Plasmoids are intelligent oozes that can alter their shape at will. Their amorphous bodies have a soft, malleable texture, and plasmoids can extrude up to five pseudopods, each one up to 5 feet long. They use their pseudopods for locomotion as well as for manipulating objects.

Every plasmoid has a mass of nerves for a brain. Plasmoids don't have internal organs as humans know them, but they have pores through which they absorb oxygen. Up to four times in its life, a plasmoid can reproduce by joining with another member of its species. After this merging, the two plasmoids separate, and one of them (determined randomly) divides in half. When a plasmoid splits in two, one of the resulting creatures is the original, and the other is a physical duplicate that lacks the experience and knowledge of its parent.

A plasmoid talks by forcing air through tubular cavities in its body, giving its voice a whistling quality.

On occasion, due to some biological anomaly, a plasmoid balloons in size upon reaching adulthood (around the age of twenty years). Plasmoids who use their increased size and strength to boss around smaller, weaker creatures can easily end up in positions of power, surrounded by loyal underlings, sycophants, and would-be usurpers. A plasmoid boss might be the master of a guild, the leader of a criminal enterprise, the lord of a plasmoid community, or the captain of a spelljamming ship. Regardless of the roles they secure for themselves, plasmoid bosses need no small amount of charm and wit, in addition to their strength and size, to stay in power for long.

Wanderlust compels some plasmoids to explore the Astral Plane and visit different worlds of the Material Plane. Such an explorer usually travels light, keeping its possessions in a backpack or similar container.

These battle-hardened plasmoids can toughen their outer surfaces, giving themselves protection comparable to light armor.

        <description>Long ago, some elves ventured to the Astral Plane to be closer to their gods. There, they ceased to age and could exist indefinitely without sustenance.

Astral elves were among the first creatures to dwell in the Silver Void. As other explorers have reached for the stars, astral elves have had to reckon with violent neighbors and strange visitors. Over the eons, astral elves have clashed with numerous invaders, including psurlons, mind flayers, and githyanki. When dealing with others, astral elves customarily cover their faces with ornate visors, becoming faceless extensions of their gods. Their fierce devotion to the pantheon of elven deities is repaid with divine power. For example, the gods invest astral elf warriors with the power to channel the radiant energy of starlight through their weapons, just as they empower astral elf leaders with the ability to cast spells and summon solar dragons.

Astral elves ply the Astral Sea and Wildspace in ships of their own design. These ships are fashioned from crystals harvested from Wildspace systems and bound together with an organic, plant-based material that hardens like ceramic. The elves sculpt these substances in various configurations to create star moths (see the Astral Adventurer's Guide) and other vessels. The elves also reshape the petrified bodies of dead gods found adrift in the Silver Void, transforming them into floating cities and citadels.

Although the Silver Void is their home, astral elves often venture into Wildspace systems and place their ships and citadels in orbit around stars. Astral elves do this for several reasons. Proximity to a star allows the astral elves to forge pacts with solar dragons and to collect starlight, which the elves use to grow crystals and repair their ships. Most important, astral elves use their time outside the Deep Astral to replenish their numbers by having and raising children.

Many astral elves are thousands (in some cases tens of thousands) of years old. Whatever their disposition, their longevity gives astral elves a perspective on time that few other kinds of creatures can appreciate. Whether they choose to live in quiet contemplation or strike out to explore the far reaches of the multiverse, astral elves tend to see events happening elsewhere as having little or no meaning to them.

An astral elf aristocrat is a brilliant, highborn leader gifted with magical abilities, including the power to channel sunlight and summon a solar dragon.

        <description>Psurlons are malevolent, wormlike creatures that live on the Astral Plane. A fully grown specimen is
7 feet long. They have legs that end in hooves and arms that end in hands with three long fingers. A psurlon's eyeless head resembles that of an earthworm, capped by a maw ringed with teeth. Psurlons adorn themselves in richly colored robes and rarely wear armor or carry weapons.

Psurlons live for thousands of years because they spend most of their time in the Deep Astral. Every hundred years or so, psurlons leave their astral strongholds, invade Wildspace systems, and indulge in a seven-year-long ceremony called the Feast of Worlds, during which they consume as many sentient life-forms as they can before returning to the Astral Plane. Psurlons prefer the flesh of humans and halflings but don't mind feasting on other folk. They use their spellcasting abilities to infiltrate the settlements of their intended victims.

On the Material Plane, psurlons have been known to work with mind flayers. Together, they collect victims to feed on; the illithids devour the victims' brains while the psurlons consume the rest of the prey. Githyanki despise psurlons because of this alliance and attack psurlon strongholds in the Deep Astral wherever they are found.

When a psurlon dies, other psurlons store the corpse in a safe place. As the corpse decays, the psurlons lay one or more eggs inside it. These eggs hatch 24 hours later, each one producing a Tiny worm. For the next seven days, the worms feed on the corpse and on each other until only one remains. This worm crawls out of the putrescent remains of its dead host as an adult psurlon.

One out of every hundred psurlons is a mutant with two heads, one at each end of its body, and a superior intellect. Other psurlons look to the two-headed ones for leadership.

This worm crawls out of the putrescent remains of its dead host as an adult psurlon.

A psurlon can use magic to assume the form of a specific Medium Humanoid. First, the psurlon must consume the creature it wants to imitate. It then enters a psionic trance for 8 hours, at the end of which it takes on the appearance of the creature it ate. The psurlon gains that creature's memories and languages, but none of its class features or other abilities. The transformation is permanent and can be undone only by a wish spell. Despite appearances, the psurlon ringer is still an Aberration, and other psurlons recognize it for what it is.

        <description>Reigar are androgynous folk who evolved into a humanoid shape from a species of cephalopods similar to octopi. They have bioluminescent freckles and the ability to change the coloration of their skin. A glory (or halo) surrounds each of them. This magical display is a cloud of twinkling, glittering motes that changes color randomly and repels attacks.

Reigar don't trust one another, which has been the case ever since they destroyed their home world in a war that ended with a cataclysmic event called the Master Stroke. The planet's destruction was the culmination of a plot to create the most beautiful display of carnage the multiverse had ever seen. Reigar exist solely to make art and wage war. They consider warfare to be the highest form of artistic endeavor, and every act of violence they commit is done with the intent of creating something beautiful.

Reigar wander Wildspace and the Astral Sea in search of artistic inspiration, traveling in symbiotic organic ships that they create (see "Esthetic"). Each reigar possesses a magic item called a talarith, which it created and to which it alone can attune. If this object is lost or destroyed, it takes 1dlO + 20 days for the reigar to craft another one.

Talarith:
Wondrous Item, Legendary (Usable Only by the Reigar Who Created It)
The reigar who creates this piece of jewelry chooses its form: bracelet, brooch, diadem, or necklace. While the reigar wears the talarith, any weapon wielded by the reigar deals an extra 1d6 force damage when it hits.

As an action, a reigar can use its talarith to summon a golem that looks just like the reigar. The golem obeys the reigar's commands and uses the reigar's statistics, except it is a Construct that doesn't have a talarith of its own. The golem vanishes after 1 hour, or when it is reduced to 0 hit points. After summoning a golem, the reigar must finish a short or long rest before this property can be used again.

        <description>A solar dragon (also known as a radiant dragon or a sun dragon) is born in the heart of a star. It divides its time outside its lair between patrolling its territory and hunting for food. The dragon has a serpentine body, a pair of ventral limbs ending in long fins, nebulous wings that give off light, and gleaming, multicolored scales. It can see clearly even in blindingly bright light.

Solar dragons are fond of treasure just as all dragons are, but in the airless void of Wildspace, they value food even more. Solar dragons typically feed on kindori, scavvers, and other forms of space-dwelling wildlife. A solar dragon might mistake a distant spelljamming ship for possible prey and come within range of the vessel's weapons before realizing its error and veering away. A wise or experienced captain won't take the dragon's approach as a sign of hostility. Solar dragons that are fired upon have been known to batter the offending ships to flinders.

Solar dragons are territorial carnivores, and they behave accordingly. A young solar dragon might lay claim to an asteroid belt, where food is relatively plentiful, while an ancient solar dragon might consider an entire Wildspace system its hunting
ground. They tend to give a wide berth to Humanoid folk, whom they find violent and tiresome. Trespassers who are detected in a solar dragon's lair can expect to be met with resistance, followed by hostility, especially if the lair contains eggs.

A solar dragon egg has an obsidian shell, shiny black and opaque. When an egg is close to hatching, the shell becomes translucent, allowing the light from the unborn wyrmling's wings to shine through.

A Solar Dragon's Lair:
A solar dragon customarily lairs in a star's radiant core or nests in a gigantic, hollowed-out rock engulfed by the star's blinding radiance. A star in which a solar dragon makes its lair has the following effects on creatures:

	• Blinding Radiance: A creature that is within 10 miles of the star or inside it is blinded by its intense light unless the creature has protective gear to shield its eyes, such as goggles of night or a similar form of eyewear.

	• Stellar Incineration: Any creature that enters the star or starts its turn inside it takes 132 (24d10) radiant damage. Source:	Spelljammer: Adventures in Space - Boo's Astral Menagerie p. 53</description>

        <description>Space clowns are the inhabitants of a Wildspace system known as Clownspace. The humans who once inhabited the system's three ring-shaped worlds placed their faith in a god of revelry. Their worship ceremonies were centered on festivals and frivolity. Over time, the people's happiness hinged on the ever-increasing consumption of an elixir called ThrillJoy. Only after they became addicted did they discover that the priests of their faith had distilled the elixir from demonic ichor and the nectar of the bozo flower. Eventually, Thrill Joy transformed the faithful into fiendish creatures and "blessed" them with clown-like appearances.

Space clowns acquired their first spelljamming helms from dohwar merchants (see "Dohwar"). Subsequent visits to other Wildspace systems led to contact with a multitude of other folk. In the wake of these encounters, love and fear of clowns has spread to all corners of the multiverse, just as the space clowns have done themselves.

Marauding space clowns feed on Humanoid flesh. They travel through space in garishly decorated ships and sometimes take up residence on populated worlds, where they set up carnival tents to lure curious onlookers into their clutches. They are armed with colorfully painted ray guns that work only for them; these toys are harmless in the hands of anyone else.

        <description>Space eels avoid confrontations with larger creatures unless the eels are starving. These 5-foot-long scavengers might trail a spelljamming ship and feed on barnacles they detach from the ship's hull. Wildspace hunters try to catch and kill the eels for their meat-a task easier to describe than to accomplish.

        <description>Space hamsters resemble their terrestrial kin, both in their appearance and general demeanor, and they come in a variety of colors.

The first space hamsters were created by wizards who used magic to shrink giant space hamsters to wee size, leading their creators to refer to them as miniature giant space hamsters. The magic also made the space hamsters smarter and telepathic.

These benign rodents are native to Wildspace, though countless numbers of them have found their way to worlds throughout the Material Plane, where they are known simply as hamsters. They keep their telepathic ability hidden from most other creatures they come near.

        <description>Space mollymawks are as common in Wildspace as albatrosses are on the Material Plane. They perch on the hulls of spelljamming ships and move from one ship's air envelope to another's when they need to.

A fully grown specimen is 3 feet tall with a 10-foot wingspan, and it eats whatever it can scavenge. If it finds a reliable food source, it lingers in the area (usually around a ship) until the food becomes scarce. Superstitious Wildspace voyagers consider it bad luck to kill a space mollymawk.

        <description>Space swine are a species of winged boar bred by dohwars (See "Dohwar") for a variety of uses. They can serve as mounts for Small creatures, and they also make fine trackers and capable beasts of burden. Space swine that are trained for battle are typically outfitted with half-plate barding and are referred to as death squealers.

A fully grown specimen stands 3 feet high at the shoulder and is 5 to 6 feet long. Space swine eat just about anything, but they prefer truffles. A space swine also tastes delicious when roasted and served with applesauce.

        <description>Ssurran are lizardfolk who have adapted to life in arid climates and in Wildspace. You can use the lizardfolk stat blocks in the Monster Manual to represent them, in addition to the variant described here.

Ssurran defilers can lay waste to the plant life around them and draw vital energy at the same time from other creatures that are caught in the area.

        <description>The transparent projections of unfortunate souls who perished in Wildspace or in the Astral Sea are known as starlight apparitions. Each one has a luminous, incorporeal appearance that resembles its former self, but with eyes that glow.

A starlight apparition is different from a ghost. While a ghost is doomed to haunt the place where it died until some promise or goal it couldn't achieve in life is fulfilled, the goal of a starlight apparition is to help someone else avoid or overcome a perilous obstacle or accomplish a difficult task. A starlight apparition comes into being when the soul of a deceased individual, from its resting place in the afterlife, projects a spectral copy of itself across a vast distance with the help of a deity or another powerful celestial entity. The apparition lasts only as long as its services are needed to complete the task at hand; then it fades away, never to return.

      <text>One Humanoid that the apparition can see within 5 feet of itself must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the apparition; the apparition then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The apparition now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The apparition can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.

The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the apparition ends it as a bonus action, the body leaves the Astral Plane, or the apparition is forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the apparition reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. If it reappears in a location not on the Astral Plane, the apparition is destroyed. The target is immune to this apparition's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.</text>

        <description>Thri-kreen are carnivores with insectile features and two pairs of arms. Because their bodies are encased in protective chitin, they tend to eschew armor. Although thri-kreen don't need to sleep, they do require periods of inactivity to revitalize themselves.

The Thri-kreen language doesn't employ words in the usual sense. To demonstrate emotion and reaction, thri-kreen clack their mandibles and wave their antennae, indicating to other thri-kreen what they are thinking and feeling. Other creatures find this method of communication difficult to interpret and impossible to duplicate. To interact with creatures of other sapient species, thri-kreen rely on a form of telepathy.

Thri-kreen often use weapons of their own design, particularly the gythka (a two-handed polearm with a blade at each end) and a light thrown weapon called a chatkcha (a flat, triangular wedge with three serrated blades). Gythkas typically have shafts of bone and obsidian blades, while chatkchas are usually made of sharpened bone or crystal.

A generic thri-kreen stat block appears in the Monster Manual. This section provides a few more options.

Thri-kreen gladiators relish opportunities to test their mettle in combat and often paint their carapaces with the blood of their enemies.

Thri-kreen mystics use psionics to navigate difficult terrain in Wildspace, turn invisible, and drain life from their prey. They often serve as spelljammers aboard thri-kreen ships.

Topolah spends her time making fishing poles and lures, then gives them to characters she likes (see "Astral Fishing" in the Astral Adventurer's Guide).

        <description>Vampirates are the walking, talking husks of dead pirates who refused to go quietly into the afterlife. They ply the void in their ships, plundering unsuspecting vessels and feeding on the life energy of those unlucky enough to cross their path.

A vampirate appears as a gaunt figure with milky white eyes and skin as dry as parchment. Some have a peg leg or a hook in place of a hand-mementos of a life of misadventure. A vampirate has fangs like a vampire's but doesn't use them to draw vital fluids from prey, which vampirates consider an unsavory act. Rather, a vampirate drains life energy from another creature by touching it or by siphoning off its energy from a short distance away. As it feeds on the energy of other creatures, its appearance becomes more robust, although it never truly looks alive.

Vampirates eat, drink, and sleep because they like to, not because they must. They rest in wooden coffins or crates full of grave dirt. In the absence of such containers, they can treat their ship's hold as one big coffin and sleep amid their cargo. When they're not sleeping or marauding, a crew of vampirates whiles away the hours by drinking rum and singing grim chanteys.

A ship crewed by vampirates usually has one or more shadows aboard-the Undead remains of some of the vampirates' victims.

A ship crewed by vampirates usually has one or more shadows aboard-the Undead remains of some of the vampirates' victims.

How a crew of vampirates conducts itself depends entirely on the mood and disposition of the captain. The crew of one ship might behave like a murderous mob, while another might abide by an ancient code of chivalry. One captain might allow the crew of a plundered ship to live, while another might leave only flotsam and jetsam in the pirates' wake.

The captain is often accompanied by an undying companion, such as a crawling claw or a will-o'-wisp.

A ship of vampirates needs a spellcaster to operate the spelljamming helm. A vampirate mage rarely, if ever, leaves the helm.

        <description>Mercanes are merchants who trade primarily in magic items and advanced technology, including artifacts and spelljamming helms. These 12-foot tall, lanky, blue giants dress in elegant robes and have elongated heads and long, spindly fingers. They use spelljamming ships to cross the Astral Sea and travel from world to world within Wildspace systems, where they conduct most of their business. It's rare to see more than one mercane at a time, though it's common for a mercane to be accompanied by underlings or bodyguards.

Mercanes will conduct business with anyone, fairly and reliably, provided the other party has neither harmed nor swindled another mercane in the past. Mercanes have a special form of telepathy that enables them to communicate with one another across the multiverse. A mercane often uses this ability to warn another mercanes about individuals who are dangerous or unreliable. Once a mercane has been offended by someone, getting back into their good graces is next to impossible.

Vocath is a mercane arms merchant.

Vocath employs giff and githyanki guards, each of whom has the mercane's personal sigil tattooed on the back of their right hand. Having this mark allows its bearer to bypass certain security features. As an action, a bearer of Vocath's sigil can use the tattoo to cast the message spell, communicating only with Vocath.

        <description>Scavvers are shark-like scavengers that fly through space, feeding on whatever they can fit in their mouths. Scavvers are not always aggressive; often they trail behind larger creatures as well as ships and asteroids, living off droppings and discarded refuse. They can enter the air envelopes of these bodies, so that as their "host" moves (often at high speed), the scavvers keep pace. The lesser varieties-brown and gray-rarely rise above the level of nuisances. The larger varieties are more formidable, in part because they often don't wait for their meals to come to them.

A scavver has a single large eye in the leading edge of its head. This eye glows while the creature is awake. Its wide mouth is full of sharp teeth. A scavver flies in lazy circles when it sleeps but otherwise moves through space much as a shark swims through water.

Void scavvers are 20 feet long. Each one is a solitary menace with a pitch-black hide. While most other scavvers are content to feed on kitchen scraps, a void scavver goes after the cook.

A void scavver can emit an invisible ray from its eye that causes its target to feel fear even more intense than what it might normally experience given the creature's size and nature.

A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the scavver, and takes 11 (2d10) acid damage at the start of each of the scavver's turns from the digestive juices in the scavver's gullet.

If the scavver takes 25 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the scavver must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the swallowed creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the scavver. If the scavver dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.</text>

        <description>It's easy to spot giff in a room: these burly folk are 7-foot-tall, hippopotamus-headed people. In Wildspace and its associated ports, giff are most often encountered as spacefaring mercenaries. These troops are renowned for their martial training and love of explosives and are typically armed with gleaming firearms.

Every aspect of these spacefaring giff's society is organized along military lines. From birth until death, each has a military rank. Promotions don't depend on time in service but are granted by superiors as rewards for valor.

Muskets and grenades are the specialties of many giff regiments. The bigger the boom, the brighter the flash, and the thicker the smoke it produces, the greater the glory for the one wielding the weapon.

Giff shipmates, who make up the bulk of the crew on most giff vessels, are disciplined sailors.

        <description>Lunar dragons (also known as moon dragons or phase dragons) are capricious, xenophobic creatures that make their lairs inside desolate moons by burrowing through the rock.

Before laying eggs, a female lunar dragon stocks her lair with food; she won't leave the lair again until the eggs hatch and the offspring are old enough to fend for themselves. Lunar dragon eggs have stony shells that are pale white to light gray in color. Lunar dragons are alabaster white when they hatch and gradually turn darker as they age. Ancient moon dragons are the color of slate.

Lunar dragons enjoy depriving other creatures of treasure more than acquiring the treasure themselves. Often found among the treasures in a lunar dragon's hoard are one or more spelljamming helms (see the Astral Adventurer's Guide) taken from vessels that dared to invade the dragon's territory.

A lunar dragon can become incorporeal, but not to the extent that it can pass through other creatures or solid objects. In this semi-incorppreal state, roughly half of the dragon's body has a dark, indistinctly spectral form.

A Lunar Dragon's Lair:
The cave complex where a lunar dragon makes its lair contains ample space for food, as well as one or more hidden chambers where the dragon keeps its treasure. Depending on the composition and features of the moon, the lair might contain natural springs and heat vents, wild gardens, crystal formations, magical phenomena, or an ecosystem of lesser life forms that have adapted to living with the dragon.

Regional Effects:
The region containing an ancient or adult lunar dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which produces one or more of the following effects:

	• Black Frost: A thin layer of black frost covers the ground, which kills all ordinary plants growing within 6 miles of the lair if the dragon is ancient, or within 3 miles if the dragon is an adult.

	• Haunting Moan: A haunting sound gets louder or fainter (dragon's choice) the closer one gets to the lair. The moan is audible 6 miles from the lair if the dragon is ancient, or 3 miles if the dragon is an adult.

	• Moon Devils: Swirling funnels of dust and frost known as moon devils crisscross the area within 1 mile of the lair, intercepting other creatures they encounter. A moon devil is a free-willed air elemental that deals cold damage instead of bludgeoning damage. If the dragon dies, the moaning stops, the moon devils dissipate, and the black frost disappears over the course of 1dlO days, allowing plant life in the area to recover.

        <description>A solar dragon (also known as a radiant dragon or a sun dragon) is born in the heart of a star. It divides its time outside its lair between patrolling its territory and hunting for food. The dragon has a serpentine body, a pair of ventral limbs ending in long fins, nebulous wings that give off light, and gleaming, multicolored scales. It can see clearly even in blindingly bright light.

Solar dragons are fond of treasure just as all dragons are, but in the airless void of Wildspace, they value food even more. Solar dragons typically feed on kindori, scavvers, and other forms of space-dwelling wildlife. A solar dragon might mistake a distant spelljamming ship for possible prey and come within range of the vessel's weapons before realizing its error and veering away. A wise or experienced captain won't take the dragon's approach as a sign of hostility. Solar dragons that are fired upon have been known to batter the offending ships to flinders.

Solar dragons are territorial carnivores, and they behave accordingly. A young solar dragon might lay claim to an asteroid belt, where food is relatively plentiful, while an ancient solar dragon might consider an entire Wildspace system its hunting
ground. They tend to give a wide berth to Humanoid folk, whom they find violent and tiresome. Trespassers who are detected in a solar dragon's lair can expect to be met with resistance, followed by hostility, especially if the lair contains eggs.

A solar dragon egg has an obsidian shell, shiny black and opaque. When an egg is close to hatching, the shell becomes translucent, allowing the light from the unborn wyrmling's wings to shine through.

A Solar Dragon's Lair:
A solar dragon customarily lairs in a star's radiant core or nests in a gigantic, hollowed-out rock engulfed by the star's blinding radiance. A star in which a solar dragon makes its lair has the following effects on creatures:

	• Blinding Radiance: A creature that is within 10 miles of the star or inside it is blinded by its intense light unless the creature has protective gear to shield its eyes, such as goggles of night or a similar form of eyewear.

	• Stellar Incineration: Any creature that enters the star or starts its turn inside it takes 132 (24d10) radiant damage. Source:	Spelljammer: Adventures in Space - Boo's Astral Menagerie p. 53</description>

        <description>A zodar is a bipedal entity whose body is encased in an obsidian exoskeleton. It has no facial features aside from two narrow, vertical slits that resemble eyes, and its countenance betrays no hint of pain or emotion. Underneath its armored exterior, a zodar's body is composed of tightly knit muscle fibers that make it incredibly strong and heavy. A zodar weighs 1,500 pounds.

No one knows how many zodars exist or where they came from, but the most popular hypothesis is that they are the creations of some long-forgotten god. Zodars interact with other sapient creatures in a manner that goes beyond mere aloofness. They simply hover in silence. When a zodar finally performs some significant action, the reasons for that action aren't always clear.

One interpretation of this behavior posits that each zodar has a specific mission and is relentless in its pursuit of the goal, but it reacts oddly to situations that don't involve its mission because it doesn't know what else to do. Another theory is that all zodars are working in concert to achieve some master objective. A third, less ominous idea is that zodars lost their sense of purpose when their creator vanished, and they are struggling to find their new role.

A zodar can cause speech to issue from the air around it on three occasions in its lifetime. When it feels compelled to speak, it chooses its words wisely. It can also warp the fabric of the multiverse to cast the wish spell as its final act-it is destroyed once the spell is cast.
