Ability Score Increase:
Increase one ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.

Stasis Strike:
Once per turn, when you damage a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself, you can deal an extra 1d8 force damage to the target, and it must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + the modifier of the spellcasting ability you chose for the Scion of the Outer Planes feat) as spectral bindings try to ensnare it. On a successful save, the target escapes. On a failed save, the target has the restrained condition until the start of your next turn. These bindings manifest as chains or some other symbol of stasis. You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Ability Score Increase:

Chaotic Flare:
When you roll a 1 or a 20 on an attack roll or a saving throw, the magic of chaos flows through you. Roll a d4 and consult the Chaotic Flares table to determine what happens. A flare lasts until the end of your next turn, and a new flare can't occur until after the first flare ends.

Chaotic Flares:
d4 | Flare
1 | Battle Fury. A creature of your choice that you can see is filled with reckless fury. It has advantage on attack rolls and disadvantage on ability checks.
2 | Disruption Field. Waves of energy ripple around you. Every creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of you, or that moves into that area for the first time on a turn, takes 1d8 force damage.
3 | Unbound. When you move, you can use some or all of your walking speed to teleport yourself once, along with any equipment you're wearing or carrying, up to the distance used to an unoccupied space that you can see.
4 | Wailing Winds. Winds swirl in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on you. You and any other creatures in that area have disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws.

Planar Adaptation:
When you finish a long rest, you gain resistance to either acid, cold, or fire damage (your choice) until you finish your next long rest.

Portal Cracker:
Your experience with portals allows you to open them without a portal key. As an action, you can concentrate on a portal you're aware of that is within 5 feet of yourself and make a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a failed check, you take 3d8 psychic damage and can't use this benefit on that portal again until you finish a long rest. On a successful check, you can force the portal open or closed for 1 hour. For that duration, the portal doesn't respond to its portal key unless a creature employing the key succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check as an action.

Portal Sense:
You know the direction to the last planar portal you used while you and the portal are on the same plane of existence. Moreover, as an action, you can detect the location of any portals within 30 feet of you that aren't behind total cover. Once you detect a portal with this action, you can't use the action again until you finish a long rest.

    <text>Your connection to an Outer Plane infuses you with the energy there. Choose a type of plane listed in the Planar Infusion table. Your choice gives you resistance to a damage type and the ability to cast a cantrip, as specified in the table. You can cast this cantrip without material components, and your spellcasting ability for it is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (choose when you select this feat).

Plane | Damage Resistance | Cantrip
Chaotic Outer Plane | Poison | Minor illusion
Evil Outer Plane | Necrotic | Chill touch
Good Outer Plane | Radiant | Sacred flame
Lawful Outer Plane | Force | Guidance
The Outlands | Psychic | Mage hand
