    <trait>
      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Those who dwell for an extended time near a permanent portal to another plane absorb the essence radiating from the realm beyond. Those influenced by the same plane share similarities in behavior and even physical appearance.

You spent a significant amount of time somewhere influenced by intense planar forces or a portal to another plane of existence, such as one of the gatetowns in the Outlands. You're accustomed to experiences that would leave others reeling in terror or enraptured by otherworldly beauty, and you're as comfortable dealing with Celestials and Fiends as you are with the vendors in town (who might be one and the same).

	• Skill Proficiencies: Persuasion, Survival
	• Languages: Two of your choice (Abyssal, Celestial, or Infernal recommended)
	• Equipment: A ring of keys to unknown locks, a blank book, an ink pen or quill, a bottle of black ink, a set of traveler's clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp

Gate Warden Trinkets:
d6 | Trinket
1 | A tiny vial pendant, filled with a drip of honey that glows faintly.
2 | A small lead ingot with a strange thumbprint pressed into it that whispers when held tightly.
3 | Two lodestone spheres that chime when they attract each other.
4 | A smoldering pebble of coal that, while always hot, doesn't burn skin, fur, scales, or clothing.
5 | A feather that sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius.
6 | A ring made from a chain link that, once donned, won't come off without pulling painfully hard.</text>

d6 | Personality Trait
1 | Strange events and otherworldly creatures don't faze me.

4 | I pepper my speech with words or curses borrowed from planar languages.
5 | I've seen enough to know that you can't take anyone at face value, so I scrutinize everyone.
6 | I have a superstitious habit I picked up from my gate-town, such as touching iron when I'm nervous or arranging objects in a specific order.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Description</name>
      <text>You subscribe to a philosophy that seeks to understand the nature of the planes or some hidden truth of the multiverse. You draw strength from your conviction and, perhaps, a network of like-minded thinkers, such as the factions of Sigil (summarized below). In your travels, you explore the depths of your understanding and spread your philosophy wherever you go.

Some groups of planar philosophers might prefer certain types of characters, but by and large any character who upholds and furthers the beliefs of such a group is welcome within its ranks.

      <name>Factions of Sigil</name>
      <text>Twelve factions have risen to prominence in the City of Doors, though many more exist. Your character might belong to one of these groups or another ideological faction, perhaps one of your own creation.

The primary factions of Sigil adhere to the following philosophies:

Athar:
Deities are frauds and merely channel the might of a true, higher power.

Bleak Cabal:
There is no greater truth to the multiverse. Each being must discover their own meaning.

Doomguard:
Nothing lasts forever. The purpose of everything is to crumble and decay.

Fated:
Everyone makes their own fate and is entitled to whatever they can take and hold.

Fraternity of Order:
All of existence is governed by laws, and power comes from understanding and exploiting them.

Hands of Havoc:
Those who try to impose a single order on the multiverse are doomed to fail.

Harmonium:
The multiverse will be perfect only when everything is acting in harmony, whether it wants to or not.

Heralds of Dust:
Everyone is already dead; the entirety of the multiverse is an afterlife. Undeath holds the key to the next stage of existence.

Mercykillers:
Cold, relentless justice is absolute, and no one is above it.

Mind's Eye:
The multiverse exists to be explored. It shapes us, and we shape it in turn.

Society of Sensation:
Sensation is the proof of existence. By experiencing everything, we can understand the multiverse in all its complexity.

Transcendent Order:
Thought clouds action. To fall in step with the multiverse, one must act on instinct alone.</text>

      <text>Adventurers who dedicate themselves to a particular philosophy regarding the multiverse are welcomed among factions that embrace those beliefs. The Planar Philosopher Personality Traits table suggests various traits you might adopt for your character.

2 | Experience is everything; live in the moment.
3 | When things crumble, I find meaning in the dust.
4 | Life thrives through order, and I seek to maintain that order.
5 | When others make plans, the multiverse laughs and so do I.
