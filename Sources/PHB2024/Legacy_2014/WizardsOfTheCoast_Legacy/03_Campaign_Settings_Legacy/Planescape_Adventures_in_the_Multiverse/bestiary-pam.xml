The portal links to a precise location on any plane of existence at a point in time up to 8,000 years from the present, whether past or future. The portal lasts for 24 hours or until the dragon's concentration ends (as if concentration on a spell). The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is transported to the destination, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal. Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by the dragon from opening in the rulers' presence or anywhere within their domains.</text>

5-6: Retaliating Light. Multicolored lights surround the githzerai until the start of its next turn. For the effect's duration, whenever a creature within 5 feet of the githzerai hits it with a melee attack roll, that creature takes 3 (1d6) force damage, as magic lashes out in retribution.</text>

1-2: Chains:
      The matter smith creates spectral bindings around a creature it can see within 30 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or have the restrained condition until the end of its next turn.

3-4: Magic Shield:
The matter smith conjures a floating, spectral shield that grants the matter smith a +5 bonus to its AC until the shield disappears at the start of the matter smith's next turn. The first time a creature misses a melee attack roll against the matter smith while the shield is conjured, that creature takes 7 (2d6) force damage.</text>

      <text>The shator can perform a 1-minute ritual that turns all willing farastus and kelubars of its choice within 60 feet of itself into a living liquid form. Each liquefied demodand becomes enough liquid to fill a flask. A demodand's liquefaction lasts until a shator uses an action to end it or a creature opens a container holding the liquid. While liquefied in this way, a demodand has the paralyzed condition despite any immunity to that condition, it has immunity to all damage, and any curse affecting it is suspended.</text>

      <text>The vargouille targets one Humanoid within 5 feet of itself that has the incapacitated condition. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or become cursed. The cursed target's Charisma decreases by 1 after each hour, as its head takes on fiendish aspects, and its Charisma can't increase. The curse doesn't advance while the target is in sunlight or the area of a daylight spell. When the cursed target's Charisma becomes 2, the target dies, and its head tears from its body and becomes a new vargouille reflection. Casting remove curse, greater restoration, or a similar spell on the target before the transformation is complete ends the curse and restores the target's Charisma.</text>

If the target's saving throw is successful or if the effect ends on it, the target is immune to the Horrific Reflection of all vargouille reflections for 1 hour.</text>

Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 31 (7d8) force damage and is magically weakened as it is desynchronized from the time stream. While the creature is in this state, attack rolls against it have advantage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. A weakened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself after it succeeds on two of these saves.</text>
