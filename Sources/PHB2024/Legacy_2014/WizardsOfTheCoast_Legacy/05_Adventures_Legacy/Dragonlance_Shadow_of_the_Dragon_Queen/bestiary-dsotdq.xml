  A Humanoid host can carry only one slaad egg at a time. Over three months, the egg moves to the chest cavity, gestates, and forms a slaad tadpole. In the 24-hour period before the tadpole is born, the host feels unwell; its speed is halved; and it has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. At birth, the tadpole chews its way through vital organs and out of the host's chest in 1 round, killing the host in the process.
  If the disease is cured before the tadpole's emergence, the tadpole disintegrates.</text>

She otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.

The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, Leedara ends it as a bonus action, or Leedara is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, Leedara reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body.

      <text>Soth hurls a magical ball of fire that explodes at a point he can see within 120 feet of himself. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 35 (10d6) fire damage and 35 (10d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
  Additionally, any Medium or smaller Humanoid killed by this damage, as well as every corpse of such a creature within the sphere, becomes a skeleton (see the Monster Manual) under Soth's control. The skeleton acts on Soth's initiative but immediately after his turn. Absent any other command, the skeleton tries to kill any non-Undead creature it encounters.</text>

      <name>Banner Pike</name>
      <text>Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 13 (3d8) necrotic damage. If the target is a Humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or be cursed. The curse lasts until it is lifted by remove curse or similar magic. Black, thorny rose stems sprout from the creature's body while it is cursed, imposing disadvantage on the creature's ability checks and attack rolls and halving its speed. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw against the curse is immune to it for 24 hours.</text>

      <text>Wersten recites names of souls slain by Soth and his company, channeling their mortal terror. Each creature that isn't an Undead within 30 feet of her must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 (4d10) psychic damage and is frightened of Wersten for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't frightened. At the end of each of its turns, a frightened creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
