The dryad has six vines. Each vine can be attacked (AC 20; 10 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic damage). Destroying a vine deals no damage to the dryad, but any creature grappled by that vine no longer has the grappled condition. All vines immediately wither and disappear when the dryad is reduced to 0 hit points.</text>

If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target immediately dies, its body disappears, and its soul is trapped inside one of the soul gems within the false lich's skull. After 24 hours, the gem transfers the soul to the false lich's creator.

When the false lich is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed and disintegrates, leaving behind the gems. Crushing a gem releases any souls trapped within, at which point the soul's body re-forms in an unoccupied space nearest to the gem and in the same state as it was when its soul was trapped.</text>

While in mist form, Kaylan can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water.

While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can't revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point.

The charmed target regards Kaylan as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under Kaylan's control, it takes Kaylan's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for Kaylan's bite attack.

Each time Kaylan or Kaylan's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until Kaylan is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.</text>

The target takes 21 (6d6) force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Rerak then regains a number of hit points equal to the amount of force damage taken.

If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target immediately dies, its body disappears, and its soul is trapped inside one of the soul gems within Rerak's skull. After 24 hours, the gem transfers the soul to Rerak's creator.

When Rerak is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed and disintegrates, leaving behind the gems. Crushing a gem releases any souls trapped within, at which point the soul's body re-forms in an unoccupied space nearest to the gem and in the same state as it was when its soul was trapped.</text>

While in bat form, Sangora can't speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

While in mist form, Sangora can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water.

Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and Sangora regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under Sangora's control.</text>

      <text>Sangora targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see Sangora, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by Sangora. The charmed target regards Sangora as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under Sangora's control, it takes Sangora's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for Sangora's bite attack.

Each time Sangora or Sangora's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until Sangora is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.</text>

      <text>Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) psychic damage. This is a magic weapon attack. On a critical hit against a target in an astral body (as with the astral projection spell), Zastra can cut the silvery cord that tethers the target to its material body, instead of dealing damage.</text>
