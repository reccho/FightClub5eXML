A swallowed creature has the blinded and restrained conditions, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the froghemoth, and takes 10 (3d6) acid damage at the start of each of the froghemoth's turns.

The froghemoth's gullet can hold up to three creatures at a time. If the froghemoth takes 25 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the froghemoth must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, each of which lands in a space within 10 feet of the froghemoth and has the prone condition. If the froghemoth dies, any swallowed creatures are no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 10 feet of movement, exiting with the prone condition.</text>
