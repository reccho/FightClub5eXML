    <description>Pechs are slight, bipedal diggers from the Elemental Plane of Earth. They have a knack for finding weak points in buildings, objects, and raw materials, making them phenomenal excavatorsâ€”and, if the occasion calls for it, sappers and saboteurs. Pechs enjoy sculpting and carving vast networks of tunnels and warrens, where they live in clans and mine precious metals and gems.

Small and lithe, pechs have long, thin limbs and broad feet. Their large, pupilless eyes are sensitive to bright light, which they avoid, and they find sunlight nauseating. Their skin displays a spectrum of color and texture as varied as that of clay, earth, and stone.

A pech can draw on the magic of the Elemental Plane of Earth to shape stone to its will, but pechs are stronger together than alone. When in groups, pechs can combine their magic to conjure great curtains of stone and infuse creatures with the fortitude of elemental earth.
