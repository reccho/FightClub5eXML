      <name>Description</name>

      <name>Ability Score Increases</name>
      <text>Increase one ability score by 2 and increase a different one by 1, or you increase three different scores by 1.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Age</name>
      <text>Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Alignment</name>
      <text>Dragonborn tend towards extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the other in the cosmic war between Good and Evil (represented by Bahamut and Tiamat, respectively). More side with Bahamut than Tiamat (whose non-dragon followers are mostly kobolds), but villainous dragonborn can be quite terrible indeed. Some rare few choose to devote themselves to lesser dragon deities, such as Chronepsis (Neutral), and fewer still choose to worship Io, the Ninefold Dragon, who is all alignments at once.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Size</name>
      <text>Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.

To set your height and weight randomly, start with rolling a size modifier:

Size modifier = 2d8
Height = 5 feet + 6 inches + your size modifier in inches
Weight in pounds = 175 + (2d6 Ã— your size modifier)</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Gem Ancestry</name>
      <text>You trace your ancestry to a Gem dragon, granting you a special magical affinity. Choose one type of dragon from the Gem Ancestry table. This determines the damage type for your other traits as shown in the table.

Gem Ancestry:
Dragon | Damage Type
Amethyst | Force
Crystal | Radiant
Emerald | Psychic
Sapphire | Thunder
Topaz | Necrotic</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Breath Weapon</name>
      <text>When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus).

On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 damage of the type associated with your Gem Ancestry. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

You can use your Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Draconic Resistance</name>

    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Psionic Mind</name>

    <trait>
      <name>Gem Flight</name>
      <text>Starting at 5th level, you can use a bonus action to manifest spectral wings on your body. These wings last for 1 minute. For the duration, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Languages</name>
      <text>You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.</text>
