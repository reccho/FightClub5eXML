    <trait>
      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Though you aren't a Giant, you grew up among giants. Maybe you were an orphan taken in by a sympathetic family of stone giants who raised you as one of their own. Or perhaps you lived in a lost prehistoric pocket of the world, surrounded by giants and fearsome behemoths or hulking dinosaurs.

Something about your environment — perhaps the food or water that sustained you, elemental magic inherent in the site of your home, or some verdant blessing of growth placed on you — caused you to grow to a remarkable size for your kind. With the aid of this magic, you have learned how to embody the might of giants. You are used to moving through a world much bigger than you, and that is reflected in your skills, attitude, and perspective on life.

	• Skill Proficiencies: Intimidation, Survival
	• Languages: Giant and one other language of your choice
	• Equipment: A backpack, a set of traveler's clothes, a small stone or sprig that reminds you of home, and a pouch containing 10 gp

      <text>How you came to live among colossal creatures is up to you to determine, but the Foundling Origin table suggests a variety of possibilities.

Foundling Origin:
d6 | Origin
1 | You were found as a baby by a family of nomadic giants who raised you as one of their own.
2 | A family of stone giants rescued you when you fell into a mountain chasm, and you have lived with them underground ever since.
3 | You were lost or abandoned as a child in a jungle that teemed with ravenous dinosaurs. There, you found an equally lost frost giant; together, you survived.
4 | Your farm was crushed and your family killed in a battle between warring groups of giants. Racked with guilt over the destruction, a sympathetic giant soldier promised to care for you.
5 | After you had a series of strange dreams as a child, your superstitious parents sent you to study with a powerful but aloof storm giant oracle.
6 | While playing hide-and-seek with your friends, you stumbled into the castle of a cloud giant, who immediately adopted you.</text>

d6 | Personality Trait
1 | What I lack in stature compared to giants, I make up for with sheer spite.
2 | I insist on being taken seriously as a full-grown adult. Nobody talks down to me!
3 | Crowded spaces make me uncomfortable. I'd much rather be in an open field than a bustling tavern.
4 | I embrace my shorter stature. It helps me stay unnoticed—and underestimated.
5 | Every avalanche begins as a single pebble.
6 | The world always feels too big, and I'm afraid I'll never find my place in it.</text>

d6 | Personality Trait
1 | Is it practical to learn an ancient language that is rarely spoken? No. But is it fun? Very.

5 | Life may be a whirlwind of chaos, but whenever I create my runes, I feel at peace.
6 | My brain struggles to process words written in ink, but the feeling of carved runes makes my mind sing.</text>
