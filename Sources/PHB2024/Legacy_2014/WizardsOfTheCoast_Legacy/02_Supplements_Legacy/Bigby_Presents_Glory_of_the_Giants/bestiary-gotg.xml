      <name>Vortex (Recharge 5-6)</name>
      <recharge>D5</recharge>
      <text>The cradle conjures a vortex of wind at a point it can see within 90 feet of itself. The wind vortex is a 30-foot-radius, 100-foot-high cylinder centered on that point. Each creature other than the cradle in that area must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 71 (11d12) bludgeoning damage and has the restrained condition within the vortex. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space outside the cylinder. The vortex lasts until the start of the cradle's next turn. A creature with the restrained condition falls prone when the vortex ends.

A creature with the restrained condition can use its action to try to escape the vortex. The creature makes a DC 19 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a successful check, the creature escapes and moves 3d6 × 10 feet away from the vortex in a random direction.</text>

      <text>The giant conjures a hail of rocks in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point on the ground it can see within 120 feet of itself. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 28 (8d6) bludgeoning damage and has the prone condition.

      <text>The scion inhales a vortex of air in a 120-foot line that is 15 feet wide. Each creature in that area that is Huge or smaller must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 120 feet straight toward the scion and be swallowed. A swallowed creature has the restrained condition, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the scion, and takes 24 (7d6) force damage at the start of each of the scion's turns.

The scion's stomach can hold up to two creatures at a time. If the scion takes 60 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the scion must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, each of which falls in a space within 10 feet of the scion and has the prone condition. If the scion dies, any swallowed creature no longer has the restrained condition and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting with the prone condition.</text>

On a failed save, a creature takes 36 (8d8) bludgeoning damage plus 19 (3d12) cold damage and is pushed vertically to the top of the cylinder, at which point the creature falls. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space outside the cylinder with no additional effects.

At the start of the scion's next turn, a mass of ice plummets to the ground on a point the scion can see within 60 feet of the point the scion dug its hands into. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius, 100-foot-high cylinder centered on that point must succeed on a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw or take 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) cold damage.</text>

This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

A Humanoid slain by this attack immediately rises as a miniature spectral cloud (use the specter stat block in the Monster Manual). The miniature spectral cloud acts as an ally of its creator but isn't under its control.</text>

The affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

If the limb is not destroyed within 24 hours of being flung, roll a d12; on a roll of 12, the limb regenerates into a troll (see the Monster Manual). Otherwise, the limb withers away.</text>
