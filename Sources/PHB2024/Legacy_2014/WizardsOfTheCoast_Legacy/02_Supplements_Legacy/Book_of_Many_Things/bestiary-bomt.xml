      <name>Bound</name>
      <text>The drone is magically bound to an amulet. As long as the guardian and its amulet are on the same plane of existence, the amulet's wearer can telepathically call the guardian to travel to it, and the guardian knows the distance and direction to the amulet. If the guardian is within 60 feet of the amulet's wearer, half of any damage the wearer takes (rounded up) is transferred to the guardian.</text>

      <name>Regeneration</name>
      <text>The drone regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Spell Storing</name>
      <text>A spellcaster who wears the drone's amulet can cause the guardian to store one spell of 4th level or lower. To do so, the wearer must cast the spell on the guardian. The spell has no effect but is stored within the guardian. When commanded to do so by the wearer or when a situation arises that was predefined by the spellcaster, the guardian casts the stored spell with any parameters set by the original caster, requiring no components. When the spell is cast or a new spell is stored, any previously stored spell is lost.</text>

      <name>Detention Orb</name>
      <text>The drone launches a tiny orb of magical force at a creature it can see within 30 feet of itself. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be encased in the orb, which expands to a size just large enough to contain the creature. While encased, the creature doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn't age. Nothing can pass through the orb, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to enter or exit the orb. As a bonus action, the drone can move the orb and its contents up to 30 feet in any direction. A successful casting of the Dispel Magic spell on the orb (DC 15) destroys it. The orb otherwise remains intact until the drone spends an action to end the effect or the drone is destroyed. A drone can have only one detention orb active at a time; if the drone creates a detention orb when it already has one active, the first orb disappears, freeing the creature inside.</text>

      <text>Euryale unleashes petrifying magic from her eyes in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw if it doesn't have the blinded condition. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature has the petrified condition. Otherwise, on a failed save, the creature takes 14 (4d6) force damage, begins to turn to stone, and has the restrained condition. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a failed save, it has the petrified condition, and on a successful save, the effect ends on it, The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the Greater Restoration spell or other magic A creature can use its reaction, if available, to shut its eyes to avoid the saving throw. If the creature does so, it has the blinded condition until the end of its next turn.

Blinded:
	• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.</text>

The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be encased in the orb, which expands to a size just large enough to contain the creature. While encased, the creature doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn't age. Nothing can pass through the orb, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to enter or exit the orb. As a bonus action, the drone can move the orb and its contents up to 30 feet in any direction. A successful casting of the Dispel Magic spell on the orb (DC 15) destroys it. The orb otherwise remains intact until the drone spends an action to end the effect or the drone is destroyed. A drone can have only one detention orb active at a time; if the drone creates a detention orb when it already has one active, the first orb disappears, freeing the creature inside.</text>

Otherwise, on a failed save, the creature takes 10 (3d6) force damage, begins to turn to stone, and has the restrained condition. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a failed save, it has the petrified condition, and on a successful save, the effect ends on it. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the Greater Restoration spell or other magic.

	A creature can use its reaction, if available, to shut its eyes to avoid the saving throw. If the creature does so, it has the blinded condition until the end of its next turn.

Pazrodine exhales a beam of moonlight in a 120-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 60 (11d10) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>

The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be encased in the orb, which expands to a size just large enough to contain the creature. While encased, the creature doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn't age. Nothing can pass through the orb, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to enter or exit the orb. As a bonus action, the drone can move the orb and its contents up to 30 feet in any direction. A successful casting of the Dispel Magic spell on the orb (DC 15) destroys it. The orb otherwise remains intact until the drone spends an action to end the effect or the drone is destroyed. A drone can have only one detention orb active at a time; if the drone creates a detention orb when it already has one active, the first orb disappears, freeing the creature inside.</text>

      <name>Searing Radiance (Costs 3 Actions)</name>
      <text>The veiled presence magically emanates dazzling light in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on itself until the end of its next turn, during which time attack rolls against it have disadvantage and it has advantage on attack rolls. The sphere moves with the veiled presence. When another creature starts its turn in the light or enters the light for the first time on its turn, that creature must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>
