      <text>The dream eater targets one creature within 5 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be engulfed by the dream eater, as the dream eater envelops the creature in a miasma of its worst fears.

When the dream eater engulfs a target, the dream eater enters its space, and the target immediately takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage. An engulfed target is restrained and blinded, and it takes an additional 10 (3d6) psychic damage at the start of each of the dream eater's turns. When the dream eater moves, the engulfed target moves with it.

The dream eater can have only one target engulfed at a time. An engulfed target escapes at the start of its turn by making a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the target escapes; the target is no longer engulfed, and it enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the dream eater. A creature within 15 feet of the dream eater also can use its action to attempt to free an engulfed target. Doing so requires the creature to use its action to make a DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince the engulfed target the nightmare isn't real, with the target escaping on a success. The creature making the check takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage, regardless of the check's success or failure, as its mind brushes against the nightmare.</text>

    <description>Originating from the dream-warped elven realm of Silvanesti, dream eaters are violent manifestations of nightmares and subconscious terrors. The true appearance of a dream eater is obscured, as the dream eater twists its hazy form into surreal illusions of its foes' greatest fears. However, all dream eaters share one thing: a gaping, always-smiling mouth, which it reveals before engulfing its prey in a phantasmagorical nightmare.

The key to defeating a dream eater lies not in brute force but in the ability to pierce its illusions and wrest others from its terrors. As such, bards and other persuasive adventurers find themselves uniquely poised to confront a hungering dream eater.

    <description>"Emperor Ariakas,

Glory to the Dragon Queen's name! Our designs on Abanasinia unfold according to your plans. This is no thanks to the so-called "adviser" I've been saddled with, the dragon Ember. The beast is terrifying, both in might and cunning, but it undermines my every design and terrorizes my forces. It's too canny to be caught, but I'm certain some portion of the troops we've lost to Qualinesti ambushes in fact smolder in the wyrm's gut. It thinks I don't hear, but it whispers curses in reply to my every command. Were it not one of our queen's favored children, I would have replaced my bed linens with its hide.

I will complete our queen's work with the troops at my disposal, but when I return to Neraka, I would have this viper reassigned. I recommend to Icewall.

By Her Will, Verminaard

Highlord of the Red Dragon Army"

Also known as Pyros, Ember is an imperious and ruthless red dragon who serves the Dragon Queen Takhisis. In his service to the Dragon Queen, Ember has taken on many roles at her behest—including that of a black-robed human member of the Mages of High Sorcery—but he is best known as the adviser of Dragon Highlord Verminaard, leader of the Red Dragon Army.

Empowered by Takhisis herself, Ember's innate fire can sear those nearby, and his breath weapon is a molten storm of ash and flame. In combat, Ember wears a set of magic plate armor that bolsters his already-impressive might, allowing him to annihilate entire cohorts with terrifying ease.

    <description>Said to be older than the trees themselves, the Forest Master is a wise and powerful unicorn who rules over the creatures of Darken Wood in Krynn. The ancient being's body is wreathed in protective briars, and moonlight dances around the unicorn's horn. Those who threaten the Forest Master's lands find themselves beguiled by magical mist and nigh-impregnable thorny thickets, but those who gain the Forest Master's favor are blessed with healing and protected as they traverse the woods.

    <description>Foresworn are the spirits of fallen Solamnic knights who attend to their duty long after death. Armed with spectral armor and weaponry, a foresworn maintains the martial prowess it had in life and can call on magic and its fallen brethren for aid.

Like revenants, foresworn fixate on a singular purpose, and they refuse to abandon their undead state until the duty they had in life is fulfilled. For example, a foresworn might be pledged to protect a family's bloodline from harm or guard a dangerous artifact against thieves. If a foresworn is destroyed before it can complete its duty, it returns within a few days, its strength and purpose renewed.

    <description>Irda seekers are skilled spies who use their magic to disguise themselves and gather intelligence for their allies. In combat, irda seekers can momentarily cloak themselves as they dart around the battlefield.

Irda:
The Dragon Queen created the irda long ago. While most irda embraced their wicked creator's teachings, some of them adopted the philosophies of other deities. Those irda who don't serve the Dragon Queen live in hidden communities across Krynn, avoiding the eyes of their creator and her minions.

Distantly related to oni, ogres, and other giant folk, irda have shimmering skin that ranges through shades of indigo and sea green. Their innate magic provides them with limited shape-shifting abilities and the power to create illusions.

    <description>Masters of their innate illusory powers, irda veil keepers protect their companions by weaving magical mirages that disorient foes. Rumors say that the most skilled irda veil keepers can keep entire enclaves hidden, guarding a community's inhabitants from the outside world for centuries.

Irda:
The Dragon Queen created the irda long ago. While most irda embraced their wicked creator's teachings, some of them adopted the philosophies of other deities. Those irda who don't serve the Dragon Queen live in hidden communities across Krynn, avoiding the eyes of their creator and her minions.

Distantly related to oni, ogres, and other giant folk, irda have shimmering skin that ranges through shades of indigo and sea green. Their innate magic provides them with limited shape-shifting abilities and the power to create illusions.

    <description>Thanoi are walrus-like beings who dwell in the frozen wastelands of Krynn. They sport thick, ivory tusks, which they use both to defend themselves and to poke breathing holes in sea ice as they swim.

Often at odds with the monstrous creatures that live in the frozen wastes, thanoi are adept hunters. In addition to their tusks, they use harpoons on long ropes that they can quickly reel back. Groups of thanoi hunters work together to take down monsters far larger than themselves, including remorhazes and white dragons.

    <description>In their experimentation with corrupting dragon eggs, the Dragon Armies created traag draconians, the precursor to what would become baaz draconian foot soldiers. Unlike their draconian brethren, traag draconians are little more than bloodthirsty engines of carnage. Few commanders have successfully used a traag draconian's reckless violence to their advantage in battle; for most, a traag draconian is as much of a danger to its allies as it is to its enemies. Even magic cannot tame a traag draconian's thirst for violence.

A traag draconian's vestigial wings lack the strength to support its hulking body in true flight, and they only minimally help to slow a falling traag's descent. Its metallic scales are coated in a sickly patina. In battle, the draconian can charge its body with vicious fire, burning all in its wake. When a traag draconian dies, its body explodes in a thick, disgusting sludge.

    <description>"Ariakas,

As the Dragon Queen wills me to obey, here is my assessment of your servant, Verminaard of Nidus:
Unchanged. The man remains a blustering dastard awash in blessings earned by his blood rather than his brains. He glories in Takhisis's favor and wields her power in manners both frivolous and brutal. In their bunks, his troops whisper of his zealotry and claim that those missing from their ranks have been sacrificed on his secret altar. I don't dismiss this possibility.

While his work progresses, it is the effort of an instrument as blunt as the mace he wields.

Verminaard thinks himself invincible, and I pray to her majesty that I'm present when she divests him of that delusion.

I hope you find these reports illuminating.

Ember"

Dragon Highlord Verminaard leads the Red Dragon Army—the largest and most powerful of the Dragon Queen's forces—with fanatic zeal and ruthless might. Though prophesied to banish evil forces from the lands of Krynn, Verminaard was tempted by Takhisis and her promises of glory. Corrupted by the Dragon Queen, Verminaard rose to become one of her champions, claiming command of the fiercest among the Dragon Armies.

Verminaard's extreme devotion to Takhisis allows him to channel her unholy power on the battlefield, bolstering those under his command while raining cursed fire on his foes. His towering silhouette is often wreathed in the fire of Ember, his red dragon companion and adviser.

Draconic Devotion:
Verminaard's stat block references the Draconic Devotion monster trait. Though this trait does not appear in any of the creatures in this compendium, you will find several monsters with the Draconic Devotion trait terrorizing the lands of Krynn in the book Dragonlance:
Shadow of the Dragon Queen.
