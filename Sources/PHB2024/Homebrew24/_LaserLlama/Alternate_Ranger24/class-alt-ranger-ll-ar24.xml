      <name>Ranger</name>
      <text>As the graying man made his way through the underbrush of the forest his faded green cloak made him nearly invisible. The monstrously large troll he had been stalking through the night had finally stopped to rest. As the great brute lay down to sleep, the silent green shape emerged from the trees to snuff out the life of the hideous monster.
	As the massive blue dragon descended upon the small town, a small half-elven man rolled out of the path of a blast of lightning. With the small hairs on the back of his neck still standing up from the residual electricity, the practiced hunter nocked an arrow and let it fly in the direction of the terrible beast. As the dart struck, the dragon let out a horrible roar and plummeted to the ground landing in a broken heap.
	As the fearsome owlbear lumbered toward the tiny hamlet that she called home, a small halfling whistled to her companion in the brush. At her signal, a giant dog that seemed to be more fur than anything else leaped out from hiding and stood defiantly in front of the owlbear. Distracted by her partner, the owlbear was caught completely unawares by the diminutive ranger. Once their foe was unconscious, the halfling and her dog released the owlbear miles away where it could live without menacing the town they protected.
	All three of the adventurers described here are considered Rangers, wild wanderers, and defenders of the natural world.

    <trait>
      <name>Defenders of Balance</name>
      <text>Rangers spend their lives between two worlds. On one hand, they stand as guardians of civilization, protecting those who dwell on the edges of society. On the other, rangers are expert survivalists, deeply acquainted with the flora and fauna of the natural world. Rangers protect the balance between society and the wilderness. When a wild creature wanders from its natural habitat, Rangers will track it down before it can harm innocent farmers and travelers. When people encroach upon the wilderness, Rangers will push back against industry and expansion that doesn't respect the natural balance.
	Rangers dedicate their lives to guarding the places where civilization and the wilderness meet, never fully joining either of the worlds that they spend their lives defending.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Prepared For Anything</name>
      <text>Ready to face any challenge, Rangers are survivalists at their core. The wilderness is a harsh place, and those who cannot adapt to their surroundings die. In the wild, Rangers learn to be adaptable. Drawing on their knowledge of the natural world, their connection to primal magic, and the skills passed down to them by their mentors, there is rarely a challenge a Ranger cannot overcome with enough time to prepare.
	Each Ranger has their own philosophy on how they fit into the interconnected web that is the natural world. Some view themselves as apex predators, using their marital skills and ruthless hunting abilities to keep the wild in line. Others see themselves as humble servants of the natural world.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Creating Your Ranger</name>
      <text>Consider the nature of your Ranger's training. Did you train with a mentor, wandering the wilds together, learning all you could? Or did you forge your primal connection to the natural world on your own? What is it that motivates your Ranger? Do you have a vendetta against a certain type of monster? Are you a warrior of the wild who feels more comfortable in the silence of the forest than in city streets or sleepy towns?
	No matter their origin, almost all Rangers take up a life of adventuring to impart their knowledge of the wild to the next generation. Often, in their later years, these wild warriors will take on an apprentice, passing on all their knowledge so that the safety of the wilderness is secured for years to come.

Quick Build:
You can make a Ranger quickly by using these suggestions: First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by your Wisdom. Second, choose the Outlander background.</text>

        <name>Becoming A Ranger As A Level 1 Character</name>
        <text>As a 1st-level Ranger, you begin play with 10 + your Constitution modifier hit points.

You are proficient with the following items, in addition to any proficiencies provided by your race or background.

	• Weapons: simple weapons, martial weapons
	• Tools: none
	• Skills: Choose 3 from Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Sleight of Hand, Stealth, and Survival

        <name>Becoming A Ranger As A Multiclass Character</name>
        <text>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player's Handbook, here's what you need to know if you choose ranger as one of your classes.

Ability Score Minimum:
As a multiclass character, you must have at least the following ability score(s) to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a ranger.

	• Strength or Dexterity 13
	• Wisdom 13

Proficiencies Gained:
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of your new class's starting proficiencies, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a blood hunter.

	• Armor: light armor, medium armor, shields
	• Weapons: simple weapons, martial weapons
	• Tools: none

Spell Slots:
Add half your levels (rounded down) in the ranger class to the appropriate levels from other classes to determine available spell slots.

      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Multiclass Features</name>
        <text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does).
	Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared:
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.
	Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
	If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots:
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
	If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.
	For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic:
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

        <name>Spellcasting</name>
        <text>At 2nd level, you learn to draw upon the primal magic of the natural world to enhance your survival and combat skills: 

Preparing and Casting Spells. The Ranger table above shows how many spell slots you have to cast spells. To cast a Ranger spell of 1st-level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all of your expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. 
	At the end of each long rest, you prepare a list of spells that are available for you to cast. Choose a number of spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your Ranger level, rounded down. Spells must all be from the Ranger spell list at the end of this class, and be of a level for which you have spell slots. 

Spellcasting Ability. Your power is drawn from an intuitive knowledge of nature, so Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for Ranger spells. You use Wisdom when a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, your Spell save DC, or when you make a spell attack roll. 

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier 

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Spellcasting Focus. You can use a druidic focus as the spellcasting focus for your Ranger spells. See the Player's Handbook for example foci.

Ritual Casting. Your knowledge of the natural world allows you to draw out its innate magic. You can cast any Ranger spell that you have prepared as a ritual so long as that spell has the ritual tag.

        <text>You focus your senses to hunt as a predator of the wild. Also at 2nd level, you can use a bonus action to mark one creature you can see as your Quarry, gaining the benefits below: 

	• Whenever you deal damage to it, you deal bonus damage equal to one roll of your Quarry Die, which is a d4. 

	• Whenever you make an ability check to track or locate it, you can add one roll of your Quarry Die to your d20 roll. 

These benefits last for 1 hour but end early if your Quarry is slain or if you mark another creature as your Quarry. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. When you have no uses left, you can expend a spell slot to use this feature again.
	When you reach 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th levels in this class, both the duration of Ranger's Quarry and the size of your Quarry Die increase, as indicated in the Ranger table.
