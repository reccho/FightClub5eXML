    <text>A beam of crackling energy lances out toward a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target. Make a ranged spell attack against that creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 lightning damage, and neither you nor the target can move more than 30 feet away from each other while this spell lasts.
	You can use an action on each subsequent turn to deal an additional 1d12 lighting damage to the creature. A creature can attempt to move beyond the range of the spell by using its action to make a Strength check against your Spell save DC. If another creature attempts to move the target of this spell beyond the range of this spell it can use its action to make a Strength check against your Spell save DC. Any attempts by the target or another creature (magical or mundane) to move the target beyond this range automatically fail.
	The spell immediately ends if you are forced to move more than 30 feet away from the target of this spell.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, both the initial and subsequent damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 1st.

Statistics: The spirit appears in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see in range. The Fey spirit takes on the statistics and appearance of one Beast of CR 1 or lower, choosing from among the Beasts you have seen before.

Combat: In combat, the Beast shares your initiative and it acts during your turn. You can issue it verbal commands (no action required). If the Beast has not received a command, it will move and defend itself to the best of its abilities. When the Beast is reduced to 0 hit points, the spirit disappears.

Examples include: elk, camel, giant goat, mastiff, pony, or warhorse.
	Your Steed uses the stat block of the form chosen for it, but its creature type now reflects your alignment: celestial (good), fey (neutral), or fiend (evil). The Steed's Intelligence becomes 6 if it was lower, and it understands one language you speak.
	In combat, the Steed shares your initiative and acts during your turn. You control the Steed and choose how it acts, both in and out of combat. While mounted on it, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.
	While you and your Steed are within 1 mile of one another, you can use a special form of telepathy to communicate.
	If your Steed is reduced to 0 hit points it disappears. You can also use a bonus action to dismiss your Steed, causing it to disappear. Should you cast this spell again you can choose to either conjure the same Steed, and it reappears in range at its maximum hit points, or to conjure a new Steed, releasing your previous Steed from its bond in the process.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th-level or higher, your Steed can take on the form of any Medium or Large quadrupedal or winged beast, celestial, or monstrosity that you have seen before that has a CR of 2 or lower. Examples include:
dire wolf, griffon, pegasus, peryton, polar bear, or rhinoceros.

	A creature restrained by this spell must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails three saves, it is turned to stone and petrified. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature fails or passes three saves.
	If the creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.
	If you maintain your concentration for the entire duration, the creature is turned to stone until the effect is removed.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the number of saves it must fail before it is petrified is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 1) for each level above 4th.

    <text>You cause up to two pillars of stone to burst forth from places on the ground that you can see within range. Both pillars are cylinders with a diameter of 5 feet and a height up to 30 feet.
	The ground where a pillar appears must be wide enough for its diameter, and you can target ground under a creature if that creature is Medium or smaller. Each pillar has an Armor Class of 5 and 30 hit points. If reduced to 0 hit points, a pillar crumbles into rubble, creating an area of difficult terrain with a 10-foot radius. This rubble lasts until cleared.
	If a pillar is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the pillar. A creature can choose to fail the save.
	If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, any creature on the pillar takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage and is Restrained, pinched between the pillar and the obstacle. A Restrained creature can use its action to make either a Strength or Dexterity check against your Spell save DC. On a success, it is no longer Restrained and must either move off the pillar or fall off it.

At Higher Levels: If you cast this spell with a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you create two additional pillars for each slot level above 4th.

	This spell has no effect on targets with 0 hit points. While transformed, creatures use the following rules:

Form: The new form can be any living Beast you have seen before. Creatures can only be transformed into a Beast with a CR equal to (or lower then) half its level or CR.

Statistics: The creature's game statistics, including mental ability scores are replaced by those of the Beast, but it retains its alignment, personality, and its Hit Points. If the creature is reduced to zero hit points, it reverts to its normal form.

Actions: The creature can only take the actions that would be available to that Beast. It cannot speak, cast spells, or take any actions that require hands or speech.

Equipment: Its clothing, weapons, armor, and objects it is holding meld into the new form. However, it can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

Statistics: The draconic essence manifests in the form of a Dragon of CR 5 or lower, which must match the color of the scale used as the material component for the spell. It appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range.

Combat: In combat, this Dragon shares your initiative and acts on your turn. You can give it verbal commands (no action required). If the Dragon does not recieve any commands, or if its commands are completed, it defend itself with prejudice.

Spellcasting: If it can cast spells, you can command it to do so, but it uses your spell slots to fuel its spellcasting, even if it would normally be able to cast without spell slots.

Control: If your concentration ends, the Dragon instantly disappears, the essence returning to the Ancient Dragon.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the CR of Dragon this essence can manifest increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th.

Orientation &amp; Shape: The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or an angle. It can be free floating or rest on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome, a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. Nothing can pass through the wall physically, and anything viewed through it is lightly obscured. The wall extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall. If it cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creatures must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it chooses which side of the wall it moves to. On a failure, you choose the side it moves to.

Statistics: The wall has 150 hit points and its Armor Class equals your Spell save DC. It is immune to poison, psychic, and non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, vulnerable to force and magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and resistant to all other damage types. It cannot be dispelled by a dispel magic spell, but a disintegrate spell destroys the wall it instantly.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th-level or higher, the hit points of the wall created by this spell increase by 25 for each spell slot level above 5th.

Shape: If you choose cage, it can be up to 20 feet on a side and made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart. If you choose box, it can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out of the area. The cage extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.

Creatures Inside: When you cast the spell, any creatures that are completely inside the area of the cage are trapped. Any creatures partially within the area, or too large to fit are pushed away until they are completely outside of the cage.
	A creature inside the cage cannot leave it by non-magical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. The spell or effect is wasted on a failed save, but on a success the creature uses the spell or effect to escape.

Statistics: The cage's Armor Class equals your Spell save DC and it has 200 hit points. It is immune to poison, psychic, and non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, vulnerable to force and magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and resistant to all other damage types. It cannot be dispelled by a dispel magic spell, but a disintegrate spell destroys the cage it instantly.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th-level or higher, the hit points of the cage created by this spell increase by 25 for each spell slot level above 7th.

    <text>This spell transforms up to five creatures you can see within range into a new form of your choice, and you can choose the same or different forms for each target. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to resist this effect. Shapechangers automatically succeed on their saving throw. This spell has no affect on a target that has 0 hit points. The transformation lasts for the duration, but it ends early if the target drops to 0 hit points or dies.

Form: The new form can be any beast you have physically seen while it was living. It must have a Challenge Rating less than or equal to the target's level or its Challenge Rating.

Statistics: Its game statistics, including its mental ability scores are replaced by those of the beast, but it does retain its alignment and personality within the limitations of that beast.
	The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it was transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. If this excess damage reduces its normal form to 0 hit points, it is knocked unconscious.

Actions: The actions the creature can take are limited to those its new form is able to perform. It cannot speak, cast spells, or take any actions that require hands or speech.

Equipment: Its clothing, weapons, armor, and objects it is holding meld into the new form. However, it can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

At Higher Levels: If you cast this spell using a 9th-level spell slot, you can target up to 10 creatures within range.

Hail Stones: You infuse the storm with bitter cold. At the end of each of your turns, creatures and objects in the area take 2d6 bludgeoning damage and crops are destroyed.

High Winds: Strong winds up to 50 miles per hour rage, instantly dispersing all fog, mist, or similar effects, mundane or magical. Ranged attacks in the area become impossible.

Lightning Strikes: You charge the storm with lightning. As a bonus action on each turn, you can call six bolts of lighting from the cloud, each striking targets of your choice within the area. They must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 lighting damage on a failure, and half on a success.

    <text>Drawing on the deepest fears, regrets, and primal instincts of a creature, you create the illusion of the most horrifying thing imaginable to them, which is visible only to that creature.
	Choose a point within range, and creatures of your choice within a 30-foot radius of the point become frightened for the duration. If a target is immune to the frightened condition, it must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened anyway.
	At the end of each of a frightened creature's turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or it takes 4d10 psychic damage. On a success, the spell ends for that target.

Frightened:
	• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
	• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.
