    <trait>
      <name>Sorcerer</name>
      <text>Sorcerers wield innate magic that is stamped into their being. Some Sorcerers can't name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their personal or family history. The blessing of a dragon or a dryad at a baby's birth or the strike of lightning from a clear sky might spark a Sorcerer's gift. So too might the gift of a deity, exposure to the strange magic of another plane of existence, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality. Whatever the origin, the result is an indelible mark on the Sorcerer, a churning magic that can be passed down through generations.
	Sorcerers don't learn magic; the raw, roiling power of magic is part of them. The essential art of a Sorcerer is learning to harness and channel that innate magic, allowing the Sorcerer to discover new and staggering ways to unleash their power. As Sorcerers master their innate magic, they grow more attuned to its origin, developing distinct powers that reflect its source.
	Sorcerers are rare. Some family lines produce exactly one Sorcerer in every generation, but most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as a fluke. People who have this magical power soon discover that it doesn't like to stay quiet. A Sorcerer's magic wants to be wielded.

      <feature>
        <name>Level 1: Spellcasting</name>
        <text>Drawing from your innate magic, you can cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Sorcerer spells, which appear in the Sorcerer spell list later in the class's description.

Cantrips. You know four Sorcerer cantrips of your choice. Light, Prestidigitation, Shocking Grasp, and Sorcerous Burst are recommended. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice.
	When you reach Sorcerer levels 4 and 10, you learn another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Sorcerer Features table.

Spell Slots. The Sorcerer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Sorcerer spells. Burning Hands and Detect Magic are recommended.
	The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Sorcerer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Sorcerer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Sorcerer Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Sorcerer, your list of prepared spells can include six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.
	If another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Sorcerer spells for you.

Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer spells.

Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer spells.

        <text>An event in your past left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with simmering magic. As a Bonus Action, you can unleash that magic for 1 minute, during which you gain the following benefits:

	• The spell save DC of your Sorcerer spells increases by 1.
	• You have Advantage on the attack rolls of Sorcerer spells you cast.

You can use this feature twice, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a Long Rest.

        <text>You can tap into the wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by Sorcery Points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.
	You have 2 Sorcery Points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer Features table. You can't have more Sorcery Points than the number shown in the table for your level. You regain all expended Sorcery Points when you finish a Long Rest.
	You can use your Sorcery Points to fuel the options below, along with other features, such as Metamagic, that use those points.

Converting Spell Slots to Sorcery Points. You can expend a spell slot to gain a number of Sorcery Points equal to the slot's level (no action required).

Creating Spell Slots. As a Bonus Action, you can transform unexpended Sorcery Points into one spell slot. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level, and it lists the minimum Sorcerer level you must be to create a slot. You can create a spell slot no higher than level 5.
	Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a Long Rest.

You use the chosen options to temporarily modify spells you cast. To use an option, you must spend the number of Sorcery Points that it costs.
	You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it unless otherwise noted in one of those options.
	Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your Metamagic options with one you don't know. You gain two more options at Sorcerer level 10 and two more at Sorcerer level 17.

You or someone from your lineage might have become entangled in the machinations of modrons, the orderly beings who inhabit Mechanus. Perhaps your ancestor even took part in the Great Modron March. Whatever its origin within you, the power of order can seem strange to others, but for you, it's part of a vast and glorious system.

        <name>Level 3: Restore Balance (Clockwork Sorcery)</name>
        <text>Your connection to the plane of absolute order allows you to equalize chaotic moments. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself is about to roll a d20 with Advantage or Disadvantage, you can take a Reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by Advantage and Disadvantage.
	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

        <text>You can tap into the grand equation of existence to imbue a creature with a shimmering shield of order. As a Magic action, you can expend 1 to 5 Sorcery Points to create a magical ward around yourself or another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The ward is represented by a number of d8s equal to the number of Sorcery Points spent to create it. When the warded creature takes damage, it can expend a number of those dice, roll them, and reduce the damage taken by the total rolled on those dice.
	The ward lasts until you finish a Long Rest or until you use this feature again.

For the duration, attack rolls against you can't benefit from Advantage, and whenever you make a D20 Test, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.
	Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you spend 5 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.

        <text>You momentarily summon spirits of order to expunge disorder around you. As a Magic action, you summon the spirits in a 30-foot Cube originating from you. The spirits look like modrons or other Constructs of your choice. The spirits are intangible and invulnerable, and they create the effects below within the Cube before vanishing. Once you use this action, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you spend 7 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.

Heal. The spirits restore up to 100 Hit Points, divided as you choose among any number of creatures of your choice in the Cube.

Repair. Any damaged objects entirely in the Cube are repaired instantly.

Dispel. Every spell of level 6 and lower ends on creatures and objects of your choice in the Cube.

        <text>Breathe the Magic of Dragons

Your innate magic comes from the gift of a dragon. Perhaps an ancient dragon facing death bequeathed some of its magical power to you or your ancestor. You might have absorbed magic from a site infused with dragons' power. Or perhaps you handled a treasure taken from a dragon's hoard that was steeped in draconic power. Or you might have a dragon for an ancestor.

        <text>Unleash Chaotic Magic

Your innate magic stems from the forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation. You or an ancestor might have endured exposure to raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to Limbo or the Elemental Planes. Perhaps you were blessed by a fey being or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke with no apparent cause. Whatever its source, this magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.
