    <text>This frosty breastplate and fur set is enchanted to keep its wearer at a constant, comfortable temperature. While wearing this armor, you have resistance to cold and fire damage and ignore difficult terrain created by ice or snow. In addition, you can cast the ice storm spell (save DC 16) at 6th level using the armor. When cast in this way, the spell is centered on your location and you are immune to its effects. Once this property of the armor has been used, it can't be used again until the following dawn.
