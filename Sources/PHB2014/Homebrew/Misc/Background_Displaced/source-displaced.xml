  <description>You don't belong in this world. You come from an alien realm where magic doesn't exist, technology is far more advanced, and the adventures you now face are confined only to fiction. You don't know how you were transported to this world or why you were brought here, but you are trying to make the best of a perplexing situation.</description>
