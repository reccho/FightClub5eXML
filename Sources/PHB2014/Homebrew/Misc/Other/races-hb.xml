      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Intelligent and curious beings, Smutsia are eager to explore and figure out all sorts of things. Smutsia are mammals and can at most birth one child a year. When a Smutsia is approaching maturity, it is sent ut to explore more of the world and find new places to live. All Smutsia are monogamous and have one partner for life, which they may have many children with over their lifetime.
	Having lived mostly in burrows and explored during the night, most Smutsia are somewhat afraid of direct sunlight as they don't know what it might do to them.

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Changelings are a humanoid race of shapechangers who conceal their true identities behind false faces. Their gifts of mimicry allow them to appear as members of any humanoid culture, playing the part of a dwarf one day and a dragonborn the next. Although changelings can adopt any guise, most rely on a few established personas, each with a developed history and a network of friends and acquaintances.

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>The bane of dungeon delvers across the multiverse, few adventurers would suspect that the things in their nightmares might be sitting across the campfire. Only a handful of mimics ever learn to take a humanoid form, and those that do often live a very lonely existence. However, hope is never completely absent. Adventuring makes for strange company, and the bonds that form between companions are far stronger than any adhesive mucus.
