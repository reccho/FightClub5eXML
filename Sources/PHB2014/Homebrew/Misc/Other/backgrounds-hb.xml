      <text>Scientists are people that believe discovery and invention are vital to progress, and seek knowledge about the world in which they live. You are one of these people... but you take things a bit too far. To most people, your ideas are crazy: unnecessary at best, and reprehensible at worst. Because of this, you're shunned by your community, though whether your "madness" is legitimate or just a label slapped on you by people who don't understand is up to you.
	You will want to discuss the reason(s) you left your home with your Dungeon Master. Did people harass you, or ignore you altogether? Were you run out of town for your bizarre experiments, or did you take your leave to try to find like-minded people? Are you searching for something obscure, or do you simply wish for freedom to study what and how you please?

	• Skill Proficiencies: Choose two from Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, Animal Handling, and Medicine
	• Tool Proficiencies: Choose two from Alchemist's Supplies, Brewer's Supplies, Carpenter's Tools, Cook's Utensils, Mason's Tools, Smith's Tools, Tinker's Tools, Herbalism Kit, and Poisoner's Kit
	• Equipment: A set of common clothes, two sets of tools you are proficient with, a book on your field of study, an abacus, a piece of chalk, and a pouch containing 10 gp

      <text>Though they may have much in common, these are not the types of scholars that fill the halls of universities. They are radical free thinkers who are defined by ostracization. Greater society dismisses their ideas and goals as anything from foolish to evil, leaving them to work in their makeshift laboratories alone, for hours, days, or weeks at a time. They're obsessed. They're dedicated. Their ideas are strange — but rest assured, no two are the same.
