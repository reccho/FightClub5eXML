Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must also succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or break concentration. The area becomes difficult terrain after the earthquake.
2. Fire Breath. The elemental exhales fire in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
3. Tidal Wave. A massive wave emanates from the elemental. Each creature within 60 feet of the elemental must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 60 feet away from the elemental. On a success, the creature is pushed 10 feet away from the elemental.
4. Whirlwind. The elemental summons a 10-foot-radius, 60-foot high whirlwind centered on a point within 120 feet of it. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 27 (6d8) bludgeoning damage and is flung up to 40 feet away in a random direction and knocked prone.

If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.
