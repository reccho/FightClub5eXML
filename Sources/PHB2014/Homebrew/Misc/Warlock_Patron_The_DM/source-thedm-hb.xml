  <description>Listen to me.

Or not. I don't really care either way: none of this is real, not a lick of it. You, me, the whole damn world...we're nothing but pencil scratches on some pieces of paper.

Don't believe me? It doesn't matter, theres nothing you or I can do about it. The world is what the world is, and it only exists so long as the DM wants to tell a story; after that, the whole thing goes *Poof*.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. What you asked about was how to contact "the DM"; Let me guess, those morons over at the College of Ooc told you about him? Figures...they have such a limited worldview.

See...the DM...it's not one creature. it may be male, may be female, may be something in between. It might be old, young, handicaped, healthy, smart, dumb, a million different things. What IS true is that, in it's world, the DM may be no more powerful than a lowly commoner...but for us, it's will is absolute. We all gain our power from the DM, it's laws and decisions affect the way everything works in our world, and it can change the very fabric of reality on a whim...but if you cater to it, play along with the story that it wants to tell, well...things can go very well for you.</description>
