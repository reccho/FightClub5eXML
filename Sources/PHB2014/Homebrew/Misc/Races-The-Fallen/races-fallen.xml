      <text>Hastily the frazzled human scrambled down the alleyway. He was the king of the back pathways, and none would dare challenge him. None, except the thing that now trailed behind him. A creature of nightmares. A Fallen. A monstrosity with a body of flames. He cuts left, then right. But still he hears the footsteps behind him. And in no time, the monster's light covers his whole body. This was the end. He knew it.

The vampire delighted himself, draining the blood from the foolish adventurer that thought that she alone could end his empire. As he did, the blood's taste felt foul, even for an undead. The corpse of the fallen warrior started to convulse with shadows darkening her skin, covering her completely. The vampire jumped a few steps back, trembling in fear knowing what was happening. The Tiefling got up and simply stared at the monster that had killed her, creating a sword out of the shadows from her new body.

The Fallen, a people who were brought back to life by non-traditional means. They weren't resurrected by a powerful spell caster, divine intervention or by a necromancy ritual, but by their own raw emotions. Anger. Failure. Fulfillment. Pride and Revenge; All feelings which can alter the course of someone's life are enough to bring back another, and even more powerful than before.

The representation of resurrection by anger. Being revived by the most negative emotion brings the most negative effects over the Fallen's body. Being nothing but bones, necromancy thrives within them. They are often mistaken for simple mindless skeletons, even by other reanimated undead.

      <text>A Fallen's memory persists when reanimated, the transformation and awakening from their previous race into their current state took barely an instant from their point of view. And for that reason, their emotions are as strong as ever.

The following table provides suggestions for how your character awakened and became a Fallen.

Fallen's Awakening:
1d6 | Objective
1 | You were backstabbed by a most trusted friend, all because of money and glory. At your dying breath you swore to bring down everything they had built.
2 | Your daughter was taken away by a Hag, and you didn't stand a chance against it. Even in this new form, you must save her before it is too late.
3 | You made a promise or an oath and don't have any intention of breaking it, even after death.
4 | You were once a powerful king from a long forgotten past. At your deathbed you had promised to make your kingdom prosper, but it's long since been reduced to ashes.
5 | You discovered a dark secret, but were killed because of it. You must stop it before something bad happens.
6 | You died on a battlefield and broke your promise to return home. However, in this new form would they still love you?</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Uncertain Future</name>
      <text>After a Fallen completes its quest, the sensation of emptiness emerges inside their mind and soul. The ones who were able to fulfill their quest may sometimes abandon their position as warriors and become hermits, isolating themselves from all the world around them, waiting for its end.

However, those who's hearts still want to fight for something continue their position as warriors until outmatched by a stronger opponent, finally being able to rest once and for all.</text>

      <name>Fallen Names</name>
      <text>Fallen usually either keep the name they had in life, either to show they're back from the grave or to be remembered. But some of them choose different names that exude power or intimidate others, always resembling their subspecies.

Examples of such names are:
Haunt, Lilith, Reaper, Revan, Shadow, Wraith.</text>

      <text>A Fallen's age is indefinite. So long as their body persists, it can maintain a life force.</text>
    </trait>

      <name>Alignment</name>
      <text>Most Fallen are chaotic in nature, finding it difficult to control their emotions. However, they are usually good or evil, rarely neutral.</text>

      <name>Size</name>
      <text>Fallen almost always inhabits the body of a humanoid creature, making their size roughly the same size as the body their soul inhabits. Choose a race and use their same size category.</text>

      <name>Darkvision</name>
      <text>You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</text>

    <trait category="species">
      <name>Perennial Nature</name>
      <text>You walk within the thin line of the living and the dead. This is represented by the following:

	• You have advantage on saving throws against disease and being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.

	• You add your Proficiency Bonus to death saving throws.

	• You don't need to eat, drink or breathe.

	• When you take a long rest, you must spend at least six hours in an inactive, motionless state rather than sleeping. In this state you appear inert but it doesn't render you unconscious, and you can see and hear as normal.</text>

The representation of resurrection by fulfillment. The ones that refuse to stay dead until they finish their work. Their appearance is a mix of spectral and physical, where if any limb went missing it is replaced by a specter of what it was.

The representation of resurrection by pride. Where one wouldn't let go of what killed them. To see what they have built gone, just like ashes in the fire. Due to this nature, their bodies are nothing but skeletons covered in magical flames that, given enough pride inside them, can even destroy magical darkness.

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Hastily the frazzled human scrambled down the alleyway. He was the king of the back pathways, and none would dare challenge him. None, except the thing that now trailed behind him. A creature of nightmares. A Fallen. A monstrosity with a body of flames. He cuts left, then right. But still he hears the footsteps behind him. And in no time, the monster's light covers his whole body. This was the end. He knew it.

The vampire delighted himself, draining the blood from the foolish adventurer that thought that she alone could end his empire. As he did, the blood's taste felt foul, even for an undead. The corpse of the fallen warrior started to convulse with shadows darkening her skin, covering her completely. The vampire jumped a few steps back, trembling in fear knowing what was happening. The Tiefling got up and simply stared at the monster that had killed her, creating a sword out of the shadows from her new body.

The Fallen, a people who were brought back to life by non-traditional means. They weren't resurrected by a powerful spell caster, divine intervention or by a necromancy ritual, but by their own raw emotions. Anger. Failure. Fulfillment. Pride and Revenge; All feelings which can alter the course of someone's life are enough to bring back another, and even more powerful than before.

The representation of resurrection by revenge. Filled with the emotion to give payback to those who wronged them in life, they appear to have missing skin and bodies torn apart by their transformation. Being so disfigured, they often wrap themselves in bandages to hide this.

      <name>Living Emotions</name>
      <text>A Fallen's memory persists when reanimated, the transformation and awakening from their previous race into their current state took barely an instant from their point of view. And for that reason, their emotions are as strong as ever.

The following table provides suggestions for how your character awakened and became a Fallen.

Fallen's Awakening:
1d6 | Objective
1 | You were backstabbed by a most trusted friend, all because of money and glory. At your dying breath you swore to bring down everything they had built.
2 | Your daughter was taken away by a Hag, and you didn't stand a chance against it. Even in this new form, you must save her before it is too late.
3 | You made a promise or an oath and don't have any intention of breaking it, even after death.
4 | You were once a powerful king from a long forgotten past. At your deathbed you had promised to make your kingdom prosper, but it's long since been reduced to ashes.
5 | You discovered a dark secret, but were killed because of it. You must stop it before something bad happens.
6 | You died on a battlefield and broke your promise to return home. However, in this new form would they still love you?</text>

      <name>Uncertain Future</name>
      <text>After a Fallen completes its quest, the sensation of emptiness emerges inside their mind and soul. The ones who were able to fulfill their quest may sometimes abandon their position as warriors and become hermits, isolating themselves from all the world around them, waiting for its end.

However, those who's hearts still want to fight for something continue their position as warriors until outmatched by a stronger opponent, finally being able to rest once and for all.</text>

      <name>Fallen Names</name>

Examples of such names are:
Haunt, Lilith, Reaper, Revan, Shadow, Wraith.</text>
