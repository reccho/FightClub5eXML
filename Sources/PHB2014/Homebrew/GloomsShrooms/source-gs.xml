  <description>The dreary market stall in front of you looks completely normal. Bedrolls, backpacks, lanterns, chalk, and other unremarkable adventuring gear hangs on hooks from the ceiling and clutters the display table. Behind the counter sits a gray-skinned subterranean gnome, outfitted in a patchy, worn suit and bowtie. He eyes you as you approach, stowing the small knife he was using to clean under his fingernails.

Far from the main market square, perhaps in a quiet alley or in the shadow of a seedy tavern, you might stumble upon Gloom's Shrooms. For those "in the know", this unassuming market stall is a treasure trove of rare items sourced from the vast network of tunnels and caverns that extend for miles below the surface.

This week's PDF includes a description of the shop and its secret, underground magic mushroom farm, it's owner (a blunt subterranean gnome), and an inventory of new magic mushrooms. It also includes two potential quest hooks, including one involving a smuggling job that may force the characters to consider their morals.</description>
