      <text>Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the bottle was not ignited, the target is soaked in flammable alcohol. The next time a soaked target takes any fire damage, that fire damage is increased by 3 (1d6) as the alcohol burns away. If not ignited, the alcohol evaporates harmlessly after 1 minute.

If the bottle was ignited, hit or miss, it shatters in a fiery explosion. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5 (2d4) fire damage and is ignited on a failed save, or takes half as much fire damage and is not ignited on a successful one. An ignited target takes 2 (1d4) fire damage at the start of each of its turns, and can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames. A flammable object in the area ignites if it isn't being worn or carried.</text>

    <description>The kobolds that run the Kobolds' Cauldron seemingly have absolutely zero awareness of the hazardous conditions under which they work day in and day out. Stills filled with explosive, high-proof liquor rest on the building's dry, splintered wood floors. These ramshackle vessels then steam and rattle next to uncovered torches and open chasms of flowing magma.

The kobolds themselves are similarly cavalier with their combat tactics, rolling casks filled with unstable moonshine at attackers, and hurling flaming cocktails of booze with reckless abandon.

      <text>The kobold carries a cask of flammable alcohol on its back. While it does so, the kobold can't use its hands to make attacks or use actions, and fire damage the kobold takes is also taken by the cask.

When the cask takes fire damage, roll a d10. If the result is less than the fire damage dealt, the cask erupts in a 10-foot radius explosion. Each creature in the area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Flammable objects in the area not being worn or carried ignite.</text>

      <name>Roll Cask (1/Day)</name>
      <text>The Kobold rolls its carried cask in a straight line 15 feet in a direction of its choice. The cask then continues to roll 15 feet at the start of each of the kobold's turns, accelerating, decelerating, or changing direction with the terrain at the GM's discretion.

The cask is an object with an AC of 10 and 10 hit points (immunity to poison and psychic damage, vulnerability to fire damage), and which retains the applicable portion of the Volatile Cask trait above. If the cask collides with a creature or a solid surface, both it and what it collides with take 5 (1d10) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it moved this turn.

If the cask is destroyed by fire damage, the Volatile Cask trait is triggered automatically. If it is destroyed by damage of a different type, it creates a 5-foot radius pool of flammable alcohol on the ground where it was destroyed. Any fire damage dealt in the pool's area ignites it, forcing each creature in the area to succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6) fire damage as the alcohol burns up.</text>

    <description>Volcanoes are not-too-seldom used as dumping grounds for all sorts of undesirable objects or materials. Their unfathomable temperatures and churning magma make them ideal for the disposal of just about anything that one doesn't want to see again.

Sometimes creatures can even be created in this extreme crucible of immeasurable heat and elemental energy. These creatures are born from the elemental heat and amorphous nature of magma, and they take the form of a writhing blob of any number of (now unidentifiable) substances melted in the volcano's caldera. A blob that wanders with intention—an intention to melt and absorb more material into its mass.
