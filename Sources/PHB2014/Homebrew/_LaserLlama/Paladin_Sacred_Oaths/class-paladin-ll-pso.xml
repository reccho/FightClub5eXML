        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of the Exorcist (HB)</name>
        <text>Since the dawn of time, the world has been plagued by the scourge that is undeath. As ancient as this threat itself, exists a brotherhood of Paladins, known as Exorcists, whose divine purpose is to protect the living from the dead. These warriors taint their souls with the foul magic of undeath, giving up any chance of a normal life, to better defend the living world.

Tenets of the Exorcist:
Though the reason for taking this Oath may vary, all Paladins who swear an Oath of the Exorcist uphold the Tenets below:

Defend. Life is a precious gift. All life, especially the innocent, must be protected at all costs.

Destroy. Undead are a cruel mockery of life and must be hunted down and destroyed.

Focus. Bear no titles or honors, inherit no lands, and have no family or children.

Oath Spells:
This Oath grants you the following spells at the Paladin levels listed in the table below. They count as Paladin spells for you if they were not already, and you always have them prepared.

Oath of the Exorcist Spells:
Paladin Level | Spell
3rd | protection from evil &amp; good, sanctuary
5th | invisibility, see invisibility
9th | magic circle, spirit guardians
13th | banishment, greater invisibility
17th | dispel evil and good, holy weapon
