      <name>The Vessel</name>
      <text>A ragged young man fled down an alley in a vain attempt to lose the thugs that pursued him. As their shadows grew longer, he realized that he had no choice. As the ruffians pinned him against the wall, he looked inward and called upon the sinister entity bound to his soul. When he finally regained his senses, the smell of sulfur was overwhelming. He fled the alleyway, leaving the charred remains of the brigands behind. They were but the latest victims of the dark presence he harbored within.
	An austere elven woman stood on a raised dais at the center of a crowded amphitheater. Members of the church hierarchy and common folk alike had come to witness her awesome transformation. She did not know why she was chosen, but within her soul was bound a fallen heavenly being, charged to perform one hundred and one good deeds in order to regain its status in the celestial courts. As the crowd gathered around, she said a prayer and gave herself over to the overwhelming radiance.
	The strange elderly halfling knew that he did not belong in the tower he called home. The tower's keeper, a reclusive old archmage, only kept him around as a reminder of what would happen to any who dared cross him. At night, the halfling could hear crying inside of his head, the sounds of a former student who had attempted to overthrow the great archmage, now bound to the aging body and soul of the lowliest student.
	All three people described above are Vessels, bearers of wondrous otherworldly power in the form of Spirits bound within their body and soul. With training, these adventurers can learn to wield a fraction of their Spirit's amazing power.

      <name>Otherworldly Power</name>
      <text>Within every Vessel is bound an extraplanar being of strange and wondrous power. No matter their origin, these immortal Spirits cannot be killed by conventional means. Instead, they are often bound to mortal flesh, forced to dwell within a body on the material plane. While many such Spirits are bound to their Vessel against their will, some choose to dwell within a mortal, lending them power in causes that align with theirs.
	No matter the reason, these otherworldly beings are the source of the power for the adventurers known as Vessels.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Mortal Vessel</name>
      <text>A rare occurrence in most worlds, mortal Vessels will likely never meet another of their kind unless they seek them out. The binding of an otherworldly Spirit is a deadly task, and is almost always done by a higher power or legendary mortal.
	Bearers of this extraplanar power can learn to channel the wondrous abilities of the Spirit inside them. Through their force of will, they can allow small amounts of this power out, channeling it to defend themselves, produce eldritch magic, enhance their physical abilities, and influence friend and foe.
	However, the mark of a true Vessel is their ability to take on the appearance of the Spirit bound to their soul, known as an Archon Form. Through this wondrous transformation, they are able to directly wield the power of the Spirit within, and use its power to overcome obstacles and thwart foes.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Creating Your Vessel</name>
      <text>When creating a Vessel, the most important thing to consider is how you came to be bound to the Spirit within you. Are you the Acolyte of a god, chosen to bear one of its angels that has fallen from grace? Are you a prophetic child of a cult, forced to bear the sinister power of their infernal lord? Or, are you descended from a bloodline of Vessels, each parent passing the Spirit on to their child when they have reached old age?
	Secondly, consider the nature of your Sealed Spirit and its relationship to you. Does your Spirit communicate with you freely, hoping that your goals will align? Is your Spirit bound against its will and seeking your demise so it can once again be free? Or, is the nature of your Sealed Spirit a mystery that you have struck out into the world to uncover more about?

Quick Build:
You can make a Vessel quickly by using these suggestions. First make Charisma your highest ability score, followed by your Constitution. Second, choose the Acolyte background. Finally, choose a Sealed Spirit.</text>

        <name>Multiclass Vessel</name>
        <text>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player's Handbook, here's what you need to know if you choose the vessel as one of your classes.

Ability Score Minimum:
As a multiclass character, you must have at least the following ability score(s) to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a vessel.

	• Charisma 13

Proficiencies Gained:
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of your new class's starting proficiencies, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a vessel.

	• Armor: light armor
	• Weapons: simple weapons
	• Tools: none

Spellcasting:
If you have a feature from another class that allows you to learn and cast spells, you can use your Vessel Magic spell slots to cast the spells you gained through that feature, and you can use those spell slots to cast your Vessel spells.

Source:	LaserLlama's The Vessel v2.2.0 p. 2 (Homebrew)</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Multiclass Features</name>
        <text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does).
	Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared:
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.
	Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
	If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots:
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
	If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.
	For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic:
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

        <name>Sealed Spirit</name>
        <text>In you is sealed a spiritual being of great power. At 1st level, choose your Sealed Spirit: The Ascended, The Cataclysm, The Cursed, The Fallen, The Formless, or The Trickster.
	Your Sealed Spirit grants you features at 1st level, and again when you reach 6th, 14th, and 20th level in this class.
	Sealed Spirit Goals Sealed Spirits are bound within a mortal Vessel for many reasons, and many of these spiritual beings have goals of their own apart from their mortal host. To decide on a goal for your Spirit, you can either choose your own or roll a d6.

Sealed Spirit Goals:
d6 | Sealed Spirit Goal
1 | This malicious Spirit was sealed against its will, and wishes your death so it may be free.
2 | This honor-bound Spirit is the guardian of your bloodline and is passed from parent to child.
3 | This Spirit sought you out so that you could accomplish its goals on the material plane.
4 | This repentant Spirit must help you save the lives of 101 innocent mortals to atone for its sins.
5 | This Spirit wishes to experience everything it can, you are simply a tool for entertainment.
6 | This Spirit has chosen you to be its champion that will stand against its eternal foe.

        <text>You can draw on the Spirit sealed in you to strike with otherworldly power. When you make an unarmed strike, you can cloak the strike in spiritual power and use your Charisma, in place of Strength, for the attack and damage rolls. On hit, these special unarmed strikes deal 1d6 damage of a type determined by your Sealed Spirit.
	The damage die of these strikes increases at certain Vessel levels: 5th level (1d8), 11th level (1d10), and 17th level (1d12).

        <name>Vessel Magic</name>
        <text>Also at 2nd level, you learn to draw upon the immense power of the Sealed Spirit bound within your soul to produce spells, much like a Warlock does. You gain the following features:

Spell Slots:
The Vessel table above shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Vessel spells and the level of those spell slots. All of your spell slots are the same level. To cast a Vessel spell of 1st-level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all of your spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher:
At 2nd level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Vessel Spell List at the end of this class description.
	The Spells Known column of the Vessel table shows when you learn additional Vessel spells of 1st-level and higher. Any spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your Vessel level.
	When you gain a Vessel level, you can replace one Vessel spell you know with a Vessel spell of your choice, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Spirit Spells:
Each Sealed Spirit has a list of Spirit Spells that you learn at the Vessel levels noted in your Spirit's description. Your Spirit Spells count as Vessel spells for you, but do not count against your total number of Spells Known. You can't switch your Spirit Spells out for another spell when you gain a level.

Spellcasting Ability:
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Vessel spells, as you are using your will to draw on the power of the Spirit that dwells within you. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, when you set the saving throw DC for a spell, and when you make a spell attack roll.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

Spellcasting Focus:
Since your magic is drawn from the Spirit sealed within you, your body is the spellcasting focus for your Vessel spells. You must have at least one free hand to cast spells that require somatic or material components, and you must still provide material components that are consumed or have a gold cost.

      <feature>
        <name>Archon Form</name>
        <text>Beginning at 3rd level, you can transform into a creature that resembles the true form of the Spirit within you. As a bonus action, you can transform into your Archon Form, which uses the Archon stat block in your Sealed Spirit description. This stat block uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places and uses your Vessel Spellcasting modifier and save DC.
	You can maintain your Archon Form for 1 minute. You then revert to your normal form unless you use a bonus action to expend a Vessel Magic spell slot to extend the transformation by 1 minute. You also revert to your normal form if you fall unconscious, or use a bonus action on your turn to do so.
	While in your Archon Form, the following rules apply:

	• Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics in the Archon Form stat block, but you retain your alignment, personality, ability scores, and hit points. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of your Archon. If your Archon has the same proficiency as you, use the higher bonus.

	• When you transform, you gain temporary hit points equal to your twice your Vessel level. Any temporary hit points you gain during this transformation are instantly dispelled if you revert to your normal form.

	• You retain the benefits of any features from the Vessel class, your race, and any other source, and you can use them if your Archon Form is capable of doing so, including casting spells with Vessel Magic.

	• When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your Archon Form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but your DM can decide whether it is practical for your Archon to use it. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match your Archon Form, and any equipment that your Archon can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with your Archon has no effect until you leave the Form.

You can transform into your Archon Form once, and you regain the ability to transform again when you finish a short or long rest. If you have no uses left, you can expend a Vessel Magic spell slot to transform into your Archon Form again.

Archon Form Appearance:
You determine your Archon's appearance, but this has no effect on its abilities. Most are ethereal in appearance, but all Archons are vaguely humanoid in shape and share a resemblance with your Spirit.

A Guide to Thematic Affinity Spells:
While some spells may not deal the damage type associated with your Elemental Affinity, they may still be appropriate picks for an affinity spell.
	For example, despite not dealing any damage, a spell like earthbind would be an excellent choice as an Earth affinity spell. Likewise, the tidal wave spell would be a good choice for a Water affinity spell.

        <name>Consume Strike (The Formless)</name>
        <text>Your Formless Spirit hungers for the power of your foes. When you are hit by an attack while you are in your Archon Form, you can use your reaction to temporarily consume the memory of the attack. The first Iridescent Strike you make before the end of your next turn morphs into a gelatinous mockery of the attack you consumed, and on hit, it deals the damage of the consumed attack along with any of its effects.

        <name>Sealed Spirit: The Trickster</name>
        <text>The beings of the Feywild are known for their whimsical and ephemeral ways, often unpredictable to mortals. Most of the faerie are content to follow these self-imposed rules and only interfere with mortals when they are approached. However, the Fey known as Tricksters cannot help but spread discord and need to be sealed away to limit the chaos they spread.
