You can project immense power. When you turn an Iridescent Strike into a ranged spell attack the range becomes 120 feet.
	Moreover, when you hit a target with a ranged Iridescent Strike, you can expend a Vessel Magic spell slot to create an explosion of spiritual power at the point of impact. Creatures within 30 feet of the point must make Dexterity saving throw. They take 6d6 damage of the type of your Iridescent Strike on a failed save, and half as much damage on a success.
	As you gain Vessel levels the damage of the explosion on impact increases: at 13th level (7d6) and 17th level (8d6)

You can reveal a fraction of your Sealed Spirit's true power, horrifying all who behold it. When you transform into Archon Form, you can force creatures of your choice that can see you within 60 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, creatures are frightened of you for 1 minute.
	A creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. If the creature is still able to see you it has disadvantage on its saving throw.

The ancient being within you can absorb magic to restore its vitality. When you are in Archon Form and a creature that you can see within 60 feet casts a spell, you can expend a Vessel Magic spell slot as a reaction to attempt to absorb the spell.
	The caster of the triggering spell must immediately make a saving throw using its spellcasting ability. On a failed save, its spell is dispelled as if by counterspell, and if it was cast using a spell slot of a level equal to your Vessel Magic spell slots or higher, you regain one expended Vessel Magic spell slot.
