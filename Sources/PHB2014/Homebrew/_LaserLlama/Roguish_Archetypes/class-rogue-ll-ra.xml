        <name>Roguish Archetype: Alternate Assassin (HB)</name>
        <text>The Assassin Roguish Archetype was originally published in the Player's Handbook, and is widely regarded as one of the more underwhelming subclasses, as it fails to deliver on its fantasy. The Alternate Assassin is an attempt to bring the Assassin up to par with the other official rogue subclasses.

	You have advantage on any attack rolls you make against creatures that have not yet acted in combat. When you hit a creature that is surprised with an attack, your attack becomes an automatic critical hit. When you score a critical hit and roll a 1 on any of your damage dice for that attack, you can re-roll those dice. You must use the new roll, even if you roll another 1.

Starting at 9th level, over the course of an hour, you can craft a perfect disguise of a humanoid creature you have slain, so long as you have the corpse and a disguise kit. To see through your disguise, a creature must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) or a Wisdom (Insight) check, contested by your Charisma (Deception) check.
	Also, over an 8 hour period, which can be during a long rest, you can use this disguise to completely assume the life of the slain humanoid. After which, other creatures believe you to be that person until given an obvious reason not to.

        <text>Most people live their lives in safety, doing their best to avoid risky situations. Even most rogues use their skills in stealth and sleight of hand to avoid danger. However, there are some who seek this danger out, living for the adrenaline rush that comes with near death experiences. Daredevils are rogues who would rather leap across rooftops than walk the streets, and in turn, they develop a knack for avoiding certain death.

Jumping in 5th Edition:
As a Daredevil, you use your Dexterity, in place of Strength, to determine the distance you can jump. With a 10 foot running start, high jump a number of feet equal to 3 + your Dexterity modifier, and you can long jump a number of feet equal to your Dexterity score. Your jump's distance is deducted from your remaining movement speed.
	If you don't have a 10 foot running start, the distance you can high and long jump is halved.

	In addition, you use your reflexes and acrobatic skill to propel yourself through the air. When you make a running or standing long or high jump, you use your Dexterity score, in place of Strength, to calculate the distance of your jump.

(Save DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier.) On a failure, it falls prone and takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.
	This special attack can apply your Sneak Attack damage, even if it doesn't meet the requirements for Sneak Attack.

Martial Exploits. You learn two Exploits of your choice from the list at the end of this Archetype. You can only use one Exploit per ability check or attack. When you gain a level, you can replace one Exploit you know with another of your choice. You learn another Exploit at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

Exploit Dice. You have three d6 Exploit Dice. To use an Exploit you must expend one of these dice, and you regain all expended Exploit Dice when you finish a short or long rest.
	As you gain levels in this class your Exploit Dice grow in size and number. At 9th level you gain a fourth Exploit Die, and your dice become d8s. When you reach 17 level, you gain a fifth Exploit Die and all of your Exploit Dice become d10s.

Saving Throws. Some of your Exploits require your target to make a saving throw to resist your Marital Exploit's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

	Exploit save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).

Crippling Strike. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die and force it to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes additional damage equal to your Exploit Die and its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn.

Disarm. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die to force it to make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, it takes extra damage equal to your Exploit Die, and it drops an item of your choice.

Feint. As a bonus action, you can expend an Exploit Die and force a creature that can see you within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, you add your Exploit Die to both your attack and damage roll for the first attack you make against that creature before the end of your next turn.

Fluid Grace. When you make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) or
a Charisma (Performance) check you can expend an Exploit Die and add it to your roll. You can use this Exploit after you roll, but before you know whether you succeed or fail.

Martial Focus. When you make a weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die as part of the attack to grant yourself advantage on your attack roll. You can use this Exploit after you roll, but before you know if your attack hits or misses.

Riposte. As a reaction when a creature you can see targets you with a melee attack, you can expend an Exploit Die and add it to your Armor Class against the attack. If the triggering attack misses you, you can immediately make one weapon attack against the attacker as part of the same reaction.

When used as a weapon, they have the thrown (30/60) and finesse properties, and on hit, your playing cards deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Dexterity modifier.
	Once per turn, when you make a playing card attack the number rolled on the d4 grants your attack a bonus effect:

Pick a Card:
d4 | Bonus Effect
1 | The creatures's movement speed is reduced by an amount of feet equal to five times your proficiency bonus.
2 | You can apply your Sneak Attack bonus to this attack even if it doesn't meet the normal requirements for Sneak Attack.

4 | You can choose to switch places in the initiative order with the target, starting at the top of the next initiative round.

Alternate Rule: Playing Cards
When you play a Gambler rogue, you can choose to use a standard deck of 52 poker cards (and jokers) to determine the bonus effect for your Pick a Card feature. When you hit with a playing card attack, draw a random card from your deck. The card's suit determines the bonus effect for Pick a Card: Clubs (1), Diamonds (2), Hearts (3), Spades (4).

        <text>At 3rd level, your conviction and faith allow you to produce divine spells, much like a cleric or a paladin does.

Cantrips:
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the Justicar Spell List at the end of this Archetype, and you learn an additional Justicar cantrip when you reach 10th level.

Spell Slots:
The Justicar Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st-level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the wrathful smite spell and have both a 1st and a 2nd-level spell slot, you can cast wrathful smite using either spell slot.

Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher:
You know three 1st-level justicar spells. The Spells Known column of the Justicar Spellcasting table shows when you learn more spells of 1st-level or higher, of a level for which you have spell slots.
	When you gain a level, you can replace one of your Spells Known with another spell from the Justicar Spell List. The spell must also be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability:
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for justicar spells, as your power is fueled by belief. You use Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. You also use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC or making a spell attack roll for a justicar spell.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
