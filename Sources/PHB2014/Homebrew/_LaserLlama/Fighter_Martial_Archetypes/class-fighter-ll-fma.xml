        <name>Martial Archetype: Commander (HB)</name>
        <text>Not all Fighters rely solely on themselves in battle, some use their knowledge of battlefield tactics to command their allies. Commanders are warriors who lead their soldiers from the front, issuing Orders and inspiring greatness in others with their own brave deeds. By their presence, a Commander can transform an unorganized militia into a deadly force.

        <name>Martial Archetype: Crusader (HB)</name>
        <text>Many warriors swear Oaths to gods of battle and war, but not all are blessed with the divine abilities of Paladins or Clerics. Those who fight for the gods without their explicit blessing are known as Crusaders. These zealots stand as champions of divine causes, their fervent belief fueling their battle fury.
	Crusaders serve many gods and causes, but they all have one thing in common; fanatical devotion to what they believe is right. Their belief is forged in the fires of devotion, and a Crusader will snap rather than bend.

Optional Rule: Oathbreaker Paladins
Should a Paladin break or forsake their Oath in your game, the Crusader Archetype here can be used to represent a Paladin who has lost their divine power.

	• When the creature is within your reach and casts a spell or makes an attack against a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack.

	• When the creature forces you to make a saving throw, you can roll a d6, and add the result to your saving throw.

Your Mark lasts for 1 minute, or until the Marked creature is slain. Once you Mark a creature in this way you must finish a short or long rest before you can Mark another creature as the target of your Crusader's Ire.

Loyal Hounds &amp; other Canines:
Depending on your table and game setting, there are many creatures that could be a Loyal Hound.
	In most mundane settings, your Loyal Hound is most likely going to be a dog, wolf, or similar four-legged canine creature. In a fantastical game, any quadruped beast or monstrosity could be trained as a Loyal Hound. Talk to your DM about options!

	As a bonus action, you can eat a prepared Ration, or feed a Ration to a creature within 5 feet. Consuming a Ration ends any current Ration effects on that creature. Any Rations you have prepared become inert at the end of your next long rest.

Below are the Rations available to Quartermaster Fighters. If a Ration has a Fighter level prerequisite, you can prepare the Ration at the same time you meet the prerequisite level.

Fortifying Ration:
Prerequisite: 3rd level Fighter (duration, 1 minute)
Upon consumption, the creature chooses either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. For the duration, the creature can add your Constitution modifier (minimum of +1) to any ability check or saving throw for the chosen ability score.
	At 10th level the duration of the effect increases to 1 hour.

Invigorating Ration:
Prerequisite: 3rd level Fighter (duration, instantaneous)
Upon consumption, the creature regains hit points equal to 1d10 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of +1).
	At 10th level, this Ration restores an additional 1d10 hit points, and any hit points they regain that exceed their hit point maximum become temporary hit points.

Revitalizing Ration:
Prerequisite: 3rd level Fighter (duration, instantaneous)
Upon consumption, the creature ends one of the following conditions currently affecting it:
blindness, deafness, poison, or it can reduce its exhaustion level by 1.
	At 10th level, this Ration can also cure a creature of the charmed, frightened, paralyzed, or stunned condition.

Stimulating Ration:
Prerequisite: 3rd level Fighter (duration, instantaneous)
This Ration must be consumed as part of a short rest. Upon consumption, the creature gains advantage on the roll for any Hit Dice they choose to expend during that short rest.
	At 10th level, consuming this Ration allows the creature to treat any Hit Dice it expends during the short rest as the maximum possible result instead of rolling.

Limbering Ration:
Prerequisite: 5th level Fighter (duration, 1 minute)
Upon consumption, the creature's speed increases by 10 feet.
	At 10th level the creature's speed increases by 20 feet.

Thickening Ration:
Prerequisite: 5th level Fighter (duration, 1 minute)
Upon consumption, the creature gains resistance to either bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (its choice).
	At 10th level consuming this Ration grants the creature resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

Engorging Ration:
Prerequisite: 7th level Fighter (duration, 1 minute)
Upon consumption, the creature grows by one size category, for example, from Medium to Large. While the creature's size is increased in this way, its reach increases by 5 feet, it has advantage on Strength checks and saving throws, and any melee weapon attacks it makes deal a bonus 1d4 damage.
	At 10th level the duration of the effect becomes 1 hour.

Heightening Ration:
Prerequisite: 7th level Fighter (duration, 1 minute)
Upon consumption, the creature chooses either Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. For the duration, the creature can add your Constitution modifier (minimum of +1) to any ability check or saving throw for the chosen ability score.
	At 10th level the duration of the effect becomes 1 hour.

Warding Ration:
Prerequisite: 7th level Fighter (duration, 1 minute)
Upon consumption, the creature gains resistance to acid, cold, fire, poison, lightning, or thunder damage (its choice).
	At 10th level the duration of the effect becomes 1 hour, and the creature can choose force, necrotic, psychic, or radiant damage in addition to the other damage types.

Tenacious Ration:
Prerequisite: 10th level Fighter (duration, 1 hour)
Upon consumption, the creature gains immunity to one of the following conditions (its choice): blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, poisoned, paralyzed, or stunned.
	At 15th level, this Ration grants a creature immunity to two of the conditions from the list above (its choice).

Berserker Ration:
Prerequisite: 15th level Fighter (duration, 1 hour)
Upon consumption, the creature is guarded from the effects of death. Should it fall to 0 hit points within the next hour, it does not fall unconscious. However, it still makes death saving throws as normal, dying upon failing three.
	After a creature eats this Ration, it must finish a long rest before it can gain the benefits of any other Ration.

Rejuvenating Ration:
Prerequisite: 15th level Fighter (duration, instantaneous)
Upon consumption, the creature gains all the benefits of a short rest, including the ability to expend its Hit Dice as part of consuming the Ration. At the end of its current turn, the creature gains 1 level of exhaustion.
	After a creature eats this Ration, it must finish a long rest before it can gain the benefits of any other Ration.

Armor. As a reaction when the wearer is hit by an attack, it can force the attacker to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is blinded for 1 minute. It can repeat the save at the end of each turn, ending the effect on a success.
	Once the wearer uses this reaction, it must finish a short or long rest before it can use the reaction again.

Weapon. When the wielder hit a creature with this weapon, it can force it to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is blinded for 1 minute. It can repeat its save at the end of each turn, ending the effect on a success.
	Once the wielder uses this reaction, it must finish a short or long rest before it can use this reaction again.

Rebounding Schematic:
You modify an item so that it has elastic properties. The wearer or wielder of an object modified by this Schematic can use its reaction to add your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1) to its Armor Class against one attack.

Armor. As a reaction when the wearer of this armor is hit by an attack, it can reduce the damage by an amount equal to 1d12 + your Intelligence modifier. If the damage is reduced to 0, the attacker takes the full damage of the attack as if they had been the original target.
	Once the wearer uses this reaction it must finish a short or long rest before it can use this reaction again.

Non-Heavy Weapon. The weapon gains the Thrown property with a range of 20 feet. After making an attack with this weapon, it instantly returns to the wielder's hand.

Empowered Schematic:
Prerequisite: 7th level Tinker Knight
You modify an object with clockwork mechanics that improve physical ability and sharpens reflexes. The wearer or wielder of an object modified by this Schematic gains a bonus to its initiative equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).

Heavy Armor. The wearer can use your Intelligence score, in place of its Strength, for any Strength-based ability checks or Strength saving throws it makes.

Light Armor. The wearer can use your Intelligence score, in place of its Dexterity, for any Dexterity-based ability checks or Dexterity saving throws it makes.

Weapon. When the wielder rolls a 1 or 2 for a damage roll with this weapon, it can choose to re-roll the die, but it must use the new result of the roll, even if it is a 1 or 2.

Resilient Schematic:
Prerequisite: 7th level Tinker Knight
You modify the metallurgical makeup of this item to make it more resilient. The wearer or wielder of an object modified by this Schematic has advantage on saving throws to resist being grappled or moved against its will.

Armor. This armor grants resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

Weapon. This weapon deals bonus damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) + your Fighter level whenever the wielder scores a critical hit with this weapon.

        <text>Those who walk the dark path of the Witch Knight are driven by an overwhelming desire to destroy the great evils of the world. Those especially dedicated, those willing to give up anything, are often approached by Eldritch Powers, beings of otherworldly might. These benefactors offer power in return for a fraction of the warrior's soul or unquestioning fealty.

Cantrips:
You learn one cantrip of your choice from the Warlock spell list. Upon reaching 10th level in this class you learn one additional Warlock cantrip of your choice.

Spell Slots:
The Witch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have, and the level of those spell slots. All of your spell slots from this feature are the same level. To cast one of your Warlock spells of 1st-level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher:
You learn two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Warlock spell list. The Spells Known column of the Witch Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more Warlock spells of 1st-level or higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level.
	When you gain a level, you can choose a Warlock spell you know and replace it with another spell from the Warlock spell list, which must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability:
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, when setting the saving throw DC, and when making a spell attack roll.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
