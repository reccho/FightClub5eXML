Starting at 1st level, you can expend your hit points in place of spell slots by spending four hit points for each level of the spell slot you would have spent. Both your current hit points and maximum hit points are reduced by the number of hit points you spend. This hit point reduction cannot be lessened in any way, and the reduction to your hit point maximum lasts until the end of your next long rest.
	Moreover, when you slay a creature with a sorcerer spell of 1st-level or higher, you gain temporary hit points equal to twice the level of the spell slot you expended to cast the spell. Temporary hit points you gain from this feature can be used in place of your hit points for your Blood Magic spellcasting.

        <name>Sorcerous Origin: Voidwielder (HB)</name>
        <text>Before the primordial gods formed the world, there was only the Void. This formless, lightless, writhing chaos desires that all creation should return to it. Voidwielders are sorcerers who wield the entropic power of the Void, working to undo the very acts of creation. They are often nihilistic in their outlook on life, resigned to the fact that all will eventually dissolve into the nothingness of the great primordial Void.

        <text>Starting at 1st level, you can draw upon the power of the void and send one Tiny or smaller object that you touch into the Void. The item must be non-magical in nature, and cannot be on object that is being worn or carried by another creature.
	It remains in the Void for as long as you concentrate on this ability, as if you were concentrating on a spell. If you maintain concentration for 1 hour, the object is permanently destroyed. If you loose concentration, the object reappears in an unoccupied space as close as possible to its last location.
	You can use this feature once at no cost, and can't do so again until you finish a long rest. If you have no uses left, you can expend a spell slot of 1st-level or higher to use it again.
	The size of the non-magical item you can target with this feature increases as you gain levels in this class: at 6th level (Medium), 11th level (Large), and again 17th level (Huge).
