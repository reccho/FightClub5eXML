        <name>Risk-Taker (College of Chance (HB))</name>
        <text>When you fall short you can enhance your abilities with wild magic, possibly turning a failure into a success or a success into a failure. When you make an ability check, but before you know if you succeed or fail, you can grant yourself a bonus to your roll equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die.
	If you roll an even number on this bonus die, you add the result to your ability check. If you roll an odd number on this bonus die you subtract the result from your ability check.
	This feature improves when you reach certain levels in this class. At 6th level, you can use this feature when you make a weapon or spell attack roll. Finally, at 14th level, you can use the feature whenever you make a saving throw.

        <text>You infuse your bardic songs with chaotic magic. When you use Countercharm, you can force a creature within range of the effect to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, roll a d8 and the creature suffers the corresponding effect from the table below until the end of your Countercharm.

Pandemonium:
d8 | Effect
1 | It retreats into its mind and is Paralyzed. The effect ends early if it takes damage.
2 | It is Incapacitated and convinced that its allies are secretly plotting against it.
3 | It is Frightened of the closest creature and uses its turn to flee from it.
4 | It cannot speak or cast spells and it feels if it opens its mouth its voice will escape.
5 | It experiences vivid hallucinations and has disadvantage on all attack rolls.
6 | It is highly suggestible and will do anything it is told to do that isn't self-destructive.
7 | It experiences insatiable hunger and uses its action to eat anything it can.
8 | It uses its turn to repeat its previous turn or action to the best of its ability.

A creature suffering from this effect can make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once a creature succeeds on its saving throw it is immune to this feature for the next 24 hours.

Emboldening Melody:
If the Bard spell restores hit points, one target of the spell regains additional hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). All targets of the spell have advantage on the next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw they make.

Infectious Tune:
If the Bard spell requires your concentration, the first time you are forced to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on that spell you gain a bonus to your roll equal to one roll of your Bardic Inspiration.

Resounding Note:
If the Bard spell deals damage, you can cause it to deal thunder damage in place of its normal damage. Large or smaller creatures affected by the spell must succeed on an (additional) Strength saving throw or fall prone.

Not every Bard is a musician. Some Bards of the Colleges of Drama and Eulogies use skulls as foci, while other Bards may use gaming sets or tools.

        <text>Bards that join the College of Revelry somehow seem to be the center of attention wherever they go. They enjoy the after-party more than their performance, and they never turn down an invitation to a good time. From formal banquets to harvest celebrations of small towns, Revelry Bards live for the party.

Revelry Bards &amp; Carousing:
While most Bards will probably thrive in the social pillar of the game, Bards of the College of Revelry will excel. Many of their features rely on interacting with NPC characters in carousing environments.
	If your Revelry Bard is interested in carousing, you can use the Carousing Table on page 128 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. Revelry Bards can roll twice on this table and choose which result to use.

Carousing:
d100 + Level | Result
01-10 | You are jailed for 1d4 days at the end of the downtime period on charges of disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace. You can pay a fine of 10 gp to avoid jail time, or you can try to resist arrest.
11-20 | You regain consciousness in a strange place with no memory of how you got there, and you have been robbed of 3d6 x 5 gp.
21-30 | You make an enemy. This person, business, or organization is now hostile to you. The DM determines the offended party. You decide how you offended them.
31-40 | You are caught up in a whirlwind romance. Roll a d20. On a 1-5, the romance ends badly. On a 6-10, the romance ends amicably. On an 11-20, the romance is ongoing. You determine the identity of the love interest, subject to your DM's approval. If the romance ends badly, you might gain a new flaw. If it ends well or is ongoing, your new love interest might represent a new bond.
41-80 | You earn modest winnings from gambling and recuperate your lifestyle expenses for the time spent carousing.
81-90 | You earn modest winnings from gambling. You recuperate your lifestyle expenses for the time spent carousing and gain 1d20 x 4 gp.
91 or higher | You make a small fortune gambling. You recuperate your lifestyle expenses for the time spent carousing and gain 4d6 x 10 gp. Your carousing becomes the stuff of local legend.

If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, or the effect ends for it, it is immune to this feature for the next 24 hours.
	While stunned, the creature is in state of pure ecstasy of your choosing. It could be a drunken stupor, a fit of uncontrollable laughter, sensual hallucinations, or overwhelming pleasure.
	When you use this feature, you can expend an additional use of your Bardic Inspiration to impose disadvantage on its initial saving throw.
