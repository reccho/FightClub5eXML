  <description>When the young man's blindfold was removed he found himself in a dimly lit room surrounded by hooded figures. He stood in front of a small dais that held a vial of gleaming crimson liquid. Months of training had led him to this moment. If he survived drinking the vial, the Hunter's Bane, he would never be the same. Becoming more than human, he would finally have the power to avenge his family that lay dead all these years.
	As the horde of demonic spawn lurched toward her, the aging half-elf ran her thin blade along her palm, coating it in her blood. In an instant, the blood ignited, wreathing her sword in a ghastly blue flame. She fell upon the horde as a blur of azure fire and cold steel. The hellspawn would find no mercy from her today.
	In the light of the pale moon, an almost feral halfling got down on all fours to sniff the tracks before him. The scent of goblin was unmistakable, vile rags and rotten meats. With a bestial howl, the halfling grew in size and wiry gray fur burst forth from his arms and legs. As fast as the wind, the halfling werewolf began another hunt in the light of the full moon.
	All of the strange and monstrous warriors described above are Blood Hunters, occult guardians who infect and inoculate their blood with accursed power so they may hunt monsters.</description>
