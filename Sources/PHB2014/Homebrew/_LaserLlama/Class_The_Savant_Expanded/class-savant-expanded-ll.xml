      <name>Personality &amp; Quirks</name>
      <text>Having trouble creating a personality for your Savant, or just looking for inspiration? Choose an Obsession, Eccentricity, and an Irrational Fear from the tables presented here.

Obsessions:
In their desire to answer every question, Savants can develop obsessions. These inexplicable questions and phenomena gnaw at a Savant until they find the answers that they seek.

Obsessions:
d4 | Obsession
1 | You discovered a strange script in the margin of a book. The best scholars cannot identify it.
2 | As a child you saw a majestic golden bird fly across the sky that left a rainbow in its wake.
3 | Your father charged you to find the legendary, and most likely fictional, chalice of Bahamut.
4 | You use the word "inconceivable" all the time even though you aren't exactly sure what it means

Eccentricities:
Often, with great intellect and intense mental focus comes some strange habits. A Savant's eccentricities are usually the result of them spending too much time on their field of study.

d6 | Eccentricity
1 | You assume that every person you talk to cares about the minutia of your area of expertise.
2 | You have a really bad habit of only speaking in the technical jargon of your field.
3 | You don't understand children.
4 | When someone doesn't understand something you just haven't explained it enough times.
5 | You take diligent notes on everything even when it isn't socially appropriate.
6 | You are so dedicated to your field of study that you find yourself explaining things to your foes.

Good Luck Charms:
Often, despite their intellect, Savants develop attachments to mundane charms, objects, or clothing they perceive as lucky.

d6 | Lucky Trinket
1 | You refuse to place your faith in a single deity so you carry a multitude of holy symbols.
2 | Your father was a farmer who paid for your education. You wear his hat in his memory.
3 | Despite its ineffectiveness, you carry a whip to impress and intimidate others.
4 | You carry a scroll of insane ramblings. One day you will figure out its meaning.
5 | You wear a pair of crystal spectacles even though you have perfect vision.
6 | You never leave home without a copy of your mentor's thesis on owlbear anatomy.

Irrational Fears:
Despite their impressive minds, Savants tend to develop fears that anyone with common sense would find totally irrational.

d6 | Irrational Fear
1 | You are convinced you contracted a minor form of lycanthropy from a dog that bit you as a child.
2 | You will do literally anything to avoid interacting with fire magic.
3 | You always make sure to sleep with a silver coin in your hand to ward off night hags.
4 | You hate snakes and snake-like creatures.
5 | You are so afraid of undead that the sight of them causes you to vomit.
6 | You give out code words to your allies so they can prove they aren't doppelgangers.

Invigorating Word:
When a creature you can see within 30 feet takes damage from a hostile creature, you can use your reaction to grant it temporary hit points equal to one roll of your Intellect Die.

        <text>You have learned the artful and ancient magic of Runes.

Runes Known. You learn two Runes of your choice from the list at the end of this Discipline. Some Runes have a Savant level prerequisite, which you can learn as soon as you reach that Savant level.
	You learn one additional Rune of your choice at 6th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level in this class.
	Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the Runes you know with another Rune of your choice.

Inscribing a Rune. Over the course of 1 hour, you can use your calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a Rune you know into a weapon, suit of armor, or an object that you can wear or hold. A creature that wears or wields a Runic object gains the benefits of the inscribed Rune.
	Each of the Runes you know can only be inscribed in one object. Inscribing a Rune again dispels any previous inscriptions.

Invoking Runes. If the creature bearing one of your Runic objects speaks the language the Rune is inscribed in, it can Invoke the Rune to gain its benefits.
	Once a Rune has been Invoked, it cannot be Invoked again until the Rune Scribe who inscribed it finishes a long rest, even if the Rune is inscribed onto a different object.

Runic Casting. You can cast and concentrate on spells from your Runes, even when you have a Focus. If a Rune requires a target to make a saving throw, it does so against your Intellect save DC. If a Rune requires an attack roll, the Invoking creature uses its Intelligence as follows:

	Runic attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

        <text>Below are the Runes available for a Rune Scribe to learn. If a Rune has a level prerequisite, you can learn that Rune at the same time you meet its prerequisite. Some Runes can only be inscribed in certain objects as detailed in its description.
	Each object can only bear the magic of one Rune at a time.

Rune of Enchantment:
Item: a bracelet, diadem, necklace, or ring
Creatures will treat the bearer of this Runic object one stage friendlier than normal. For example, an indifferent creature might treat the bearer as a friend, or a hostile creature might treat the bearer indifferently. This special treatment instantly ends if the bearer attacks the creature.

Invoking this Rune. As an action, the bearer can Invoke the Rune to cast either the calm emotions, charm person or command spell, targeting a number of creatures equal to the Rune Scribe's Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 creature).

Rune of Evocation:
Item: a simple or martial melee weapon
When you inscribe the Rune you imbue it with acid, cold, fire, poison, or lighting damage. Whenever the bearer hits with an attack with this Runic weapon, it deals additional damage of the imbued type equal to one roll of your Intellect Die.

Invoking this Rune. When the bearer hits with an attack with this Runic weapon, it can Invoke the Rune to cause the attack to deal additional damage of the imbued damage type equal to three rolls of the Rune Scribe's Intellect Die.

Rune of Illusion:
Item: a cloak, robe, or suit of armor
As an action, the bearer of this Runic object can change its physical appearance to match that of a creature it has seen before, so long as it has the same arrangement of limbs as the bearer. The bearer can determine the specifics of these changes, including race, coloration, hair length, sex, height, and weight, but it cannot change its size. This illusion does not affect clothing, equipment, or game statistics.
	The illusion can be detected with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check vs. the Rune Scribe's Intellect save DC.

Invoking this Rune. As an action, the bearer of this Runic object can Invoke this Rune to turn invisible for 10 minutes. This invisibility ends if they attack or force a saving throw.

Rune of Necromancy:
Item: a belt, ring, or suit of armor
The bearer of this Runic object can use a bonus action to grant itself temporary hit points equal to the Rune Scribe's Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).

Invoking this Rune. When the bearer of this Runic object is reduced to 0 hit points, but it is not killed outright, it can Invoke this Rune to fall to 1 hit point instead of 0.

Rune of Abjuration:
Prerequisite: 6th level Rune Scribe

        <text>You have composed powerful Themes that stir the hearts of any creature that can hear them. As an action, you can begin to play this Theme, which continues until the start of your next turn, unless you choose to end it (no action required). If you are already playing your Theme, you can use a bonus action to extend its duration until the start of your next turn.
	Your Theme can be heard up to 120 feet away, but it only influences creatures within 30 feet that can hear the Theme.
	If one of your Theme's effects requires a creature to make a saving throw, it does so against your Intellect save DC.

While you are performing your Theme, you can use your reaction to alter its sound in the following ways:

Discordant Note:
When a creature under the influence of your Theme attacks another creature you can see, you can use your reaction to subtract one roll of your Intellect Die from its attack roll.

Inspiring Tune:
When a creature under the influence of your Theme takes damage from a source you can see, you can use a reaction to reduce the damage it takes by one roll of your Intellect Die.

Uplifting Melody:
When a creature under the influence of your Theme makes a saving throw to resist being charmed, frightened, or stunned, you can use a reaction to have it automatically succeed.
