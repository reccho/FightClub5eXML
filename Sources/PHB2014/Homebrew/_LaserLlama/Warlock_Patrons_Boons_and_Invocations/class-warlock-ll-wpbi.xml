        <name>Pact Boon: Pact of the Chalice (HB)</name>
        <text>Your Patron has bestowed upon you a vessel for the creation of potions and poultices. As an action, you can create a Pact Chalice in your empty hand. When summoned, it takes the form of a tiny object of your choice that is capable of holding liquids, and it grants you the benefits listed below:

	• You can use it as a spellcasting focus for warlock spells.

	• It counts as both a herbalism kit and a set of alchemist's supplies, and whenever you make an ability check that uses your Pact Chalice as either of these tools you can add double your proficiency bonus to your roll.

	• At the end of each short or long rest, you can use the Pact Chalice to conjure a vial of the following: alchemist's fire, acid, holy water, potion of healing, or potion of climbing. The liquid retains its potency until the end of your next long rest, at which point it becomes inert and unusable.

Your Pact Chalice disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute, if you use this feature again, if you dismiss your Chalice (no action required), or if you die.

	As an action, you can pause time for all creatures other than you, and move up to twice your speed without provoking opportunity attacks. You can only use this bonus movement while time is stopped. You cannot use actions, bonus actions, or reactions during this period. Time resumes when you finish your movement.
	Once you use this action, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. If you have no uses left, you can expend a Pact Magic spell slot to use it again.

        <name>Eye Tyrant (The Unblinking (HB))</name>
        <text>You have unlockd the true power of your Patron. Starting at 14th level, you can use an action to have your Unblinking Eye emanate an antimagic zone in a 30 foot cone. The area of this cone is under the effects of the antimagic field spell.
	At the start of each of your turns, you decide which way your cone of antimagic faces until the start of your next turn.
	Your Eye emanates this cone for 1 minute. The effect ends early if you are incapacitated or you choose to end the effect at the beginning of your turn (no action required).

        <name>Otherworldly Patron: The Wild Hunt (HB)</name>
        <text>The Wild Hunt is a strange phenomenon that takes hold of mortals, driving them to hunt whatever poor creature they perceive to be their prey. The source of this phenomenon is unclear, but legends tell of raiding parties from the Feywild that draw wayward mortals into their hunt, or of individuals cursed by sinister druidic magic during the full moon.
	While its exact origins are unclear, mortals who are bound to this force by a pact start to take on strange and unusual characteristics of the Feywild; sprouting antlers and their ears growing pointed. As their appearance changes, they slowly lose who they are, becoming one with the Wild Hunt.

        <text>Beginning at 6th level, when you mark your Quarry you can conjure a Spirit of the Hunt to harry its steps, forcing it to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, its speed is reduced by a number of feet equal to 5 times your Charisma modifier (minimum of 5 feet) for 1 minute. This speed reduction ends early if you mark another Quarry.
	Once you use this feature to successfully slow a creature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
