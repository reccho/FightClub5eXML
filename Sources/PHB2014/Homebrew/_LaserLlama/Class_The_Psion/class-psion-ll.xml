      <name>The Psion</name>
      <text>As an aging human watched his apprentice struggle to lift a pebble with his mind, he thought of his youth, and the years that it took to unlock his own psionic gift. After traveling the world he had found that true enlightenment came from within, and he had retreated to the cave he now called home. As the end of his own life was drawing near, he had taken his own apprentice, the young woman struggling before him now, to pass on all his skill.
	Chosen at birth due to her innate ability, the young elf had been molded into a perfect assassin. As she held the baron firmly beneath her, he let out a soft cry as her blade of psionic energy pierced his heart. The next morning, that baron's guards found him dead, though the cause of his untimely demise would remain a mystery.
	A young dwarf fled into the forest, consumed by horror of what he'd done. For as long as he could remember, there was something within his mind that he struggled with. That morning, in a moment of weakness, he slipped, and a torrent of wild psionic power erupted from within. He had awoken in the rubble of his home to find his clan buried in the ruins.
	All three of the mystics described above are Psions, those who can focus the psionic power of their mind to manipulate the creatures, objects, and forces that surround them.

    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Wondrous Inner Power</name>
      <text>Whether through years of practice, or a once in a generation innate talent, Psions learn to manipulate the world with the wondrous power of their minds. Drawing upon the mystical power within, they can communicate without speaking, move objects, alter their physical bodies, and even manifest spells. Relying solely on mastery of their mind, Psions can perform feats thought impossible, even by the most erudite Wizards and devout Clerics. For Psions, it is a point of great pride that they can produce wonders without the help of external power.
	Due to their potential, Psions are often misunderstood and feared by the common folk. If they don't learn to control their power, their strange abilities can cause them to be shunned and hated by those around them. Most Psions reveal their power only when necessary, and are hesitant to trust others.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Master &amp; Apprentice</name>
      <text>If they are lucky, potential Psions are discovered by a master and taken away from their home to hone their psionic power in seclusion. No matter their philosophy on life, every Psion holds it as their sacred duty to one day take on an apprentice with the psionic gift and teach them to control their power, passing on everything they themselves have learned.
	A Psion's master and how they are trained has great effect on the nature of their abilities. For some, their gift is honed through years of practice and meditation. Others are trained to use their mystic abilities to morph their bodies into deadly weapons. And for the rare few who are never discovered by a master, or attempt to stifle their power, they risk outbursts of wild psionic energy that can have devastating effects.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Creating Your Psion</name>
      <text>When creating your Psion, consider how you discovered your psionic potential. Was it in a moment of pure emotion? Or did you realize your power through peaceful meditation? Did you have a mystic experience that awoke something inside of you? Whatever the experience, the first time a Psion realizes their potential has an impact on how they view their power.
	Also, consider your psionic master. Did another Psion take you under their wing, teaching you to control your abilities as their apprentice? Or, did you learn to control this inner power on your own? How do you feel about your psionic gift? Is it a point of pride? Something to separate you from the common folk? Or, is it a curse only to be used in the direst situations?

Quick Build:
You can make a Psion quickly by using these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Second, choose the Hermit background. Third, choose the message and mind thrust cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells command and dissonant whispers.</text>

        <name>Multiclass Psion</name>
        <text>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player's Handbook, here's what you need to know if you choose the psion as one of your classes.

Ability Score Minimum:
As a multiclass character, you must have at least the following ability score(s) to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a psion.

	• Intelligence 13

Proficiencies Gained:
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of your new class's starting proficiencies, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a psion.

	• Armor: light armor
	• Weapons: simple weapons
	• Tools: none

Spellcasting:
If you have the Spellcasting feature from another class, you can use the Psi Points from your Psionics feature to cast spells you know from that class, and you can use spell slots from other classes to cast any of your Psion Spells Known.

Source:	LaserLlama's The Psion v2.3.0 p. 3 (Homebrew)</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Multiclass Features</name>
        <text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does).

Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared:
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.

Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.

If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots:
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.

If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.

For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots:
you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic:
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

        <name>Awakening</name>
        <text>Psionic ability, though it always comes from within, awakens in a mind depending on training, or lack thereof. At 1st level, choose the Awakening to best represent your Psion.
	Your Awakening grants you features at 1st level, and again when you reach 3rd, 6th, 14th, and 18th level.

      <feature>
        <name>Psionics</name>
        <text>Starting from 1st level, the psionic power you have awakened within your psyche allows you to manifest mystical spells.
	Though your magic is fueled by your psionic power, your spells count as spellcasting for the purposes of features and spells like detect magic, counterspell, and antimagic field.

Cantrips:
At 1st level, you know two Psion Cantrips of your choice. You learn an additional Psion Cantrip at 4th level and 10th level, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Psion table.

Psi Points:
Your innate psionic power is represented by a special pool of Psi Points. The Psion table shows the number of Psi Points you have at each level. To manifest one of the Psion spells you know, you must expend a number of Psi Points equal to the level of the spell (0 for Cantrips), and you regain all expended Psi Points each time you finish a short or long rest.
	For example, a 3rd level Psion could manifest the detect thoughts spell at 2nd-level by expending 2 Psi Points.

Mental Limit:
Your Psion level limits the potency of spells you can manifest with your psionics. This limit is reflected in the Mental Limit column of the Psion Table. When a Psion feature allows you to expend Psi Points, you can never expend more Psi Points than it costs to manifest a spell of your Mental Limit level.

Spells Known of 1st-level and Higher:
At 1st level, know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Psion spell list at the end of this class. The Spells Known column of the Psion table shows when you learn more Psion spells of your choice. Each spell you learn must be of a level equal to your Mental Limit or lower. For instance, when you reach 3rd level, you learn one Psion spell of 1st or 2nd-level.
	When you gain a Psion level, you can replace one Psion spell you know with another Psion spell of your choice.

Awakening Spells:
Each Awakening has a list of spells that you learn at certain Psion levels, as noted in your Awakening description. These Awakening Spells count as Psion spells for you. They do not count against your total number of Spells Known, and you can't switch your Awakening spells when you gain a level.

Spellcasting Ability:
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Psion spells. You use Intelligence when a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. You also use your Intelligence modifier when you set the saving throw DC or make an attack roll for a Psion spell.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Spellcasting Focus:
Your mind is the spellcasting focus for your Psion spells. You must have a free hand to cast spells that require somatic or material components, and you must still provide any material components that are consumed or have a required gold cost.
	Whenever you manifest a Psion spell you exhibit noticeable changes. Whether your eyes glow with the eldritch light of the Far Realm, or your body partially phases into the astral plane, creatures are aware that you are using your psionic abilities.

Spellcasting Restrictions:
Due to the focus required to manifest your psionic spells, you cannot use your Psionics if you are wearing medium or heavy armor, or wielding a shield, unless a feature allows you to.

Psion: Expanded Spell List
If your table adds spells from other sources, like Fizban's Treasury of Dragons or other third party books, the Psion can learn any enchantment spell available to the Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard, any spell that deals psychic or force damage, or other thematic spells at the discretion of your DM.

It takes 2d6 force damage on a failure, plus another 2d6 damage for each Psi Point you spent to create the Projection. On a successful save, the target takes half as much force damage.
	Success or failure, your Projection is destroyed on impact.

        <text>The speed at which you create your Projections has grown, and allows you to use them for your defense. When you are targeted by an attack you can see, you can use your reaction to create a defensive Psionic Projection of appropriate size between you and your attacker. Your Projection becomes the target of the attack in your place.
	If the triggering attack destroys your Projection, you take any remaining damage as if the attack automatically hit you.

        <text>Your Visionary power and ability to maintain Projections has grown. The Psi Point cost of creating a Psionic Projection is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0 Psi Points). Also, whenever you create a Psionic Projection, you can expend an additional Psi Point to grant your Projection resistance to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
	Finally, you can have up to three Psionic Projections at one time. When you create a fourth Projection, you must choose one of your Psionic Projections to be instantly destroyed.

        <name>Psionic Awakening: Wilder</name>
        <text>By far the most volatile Psions, Wilders are those who never truly learn to control the wondrous power of their mind. They often discover their psionic abilities unexpectedly as a result of a traumatic event or violently manifest their mystic power after years of attempting to contain it. Wilders are as erratic as they are powerful and rarely have psionic masters. By the time these uncontrolled abilities develop, it is often too late to gain control of the torrent of psionic power within them.

Wilders &amp; Adventuring:
Before playing a Wilder Psion, make sure to discuss the possible side effects of your Wild Psionics with your DM and the players at your table. Just because you enjoy the chaos does not mean everyone will!

        <text>The uncontrolled psionic storm within your mind makes you hard to mentally influence. Whenever you are forced to make an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, you can expend 1 Psi Point as a reaction to roll with advantage.
	If you succeed, the creature who forced you to make this saving throw takes psychic damage equal to your Psion level.

        <text>The chaotic nature of your power can produce unpredictable effects. Immediately after you expend 1 or more Psi Points, roll a d6. If the result is equal to the number of Psi Points you expended, a Psionic Surge manifests alongside your effect.
	Roll a d100 on the Psionic Surge table to determine the type of Psionic Surge effect that takes place. If a spell manifests, you are the target or center of that spell, it uses your Psion Spell save DC, and the spell effect persists on its own even if it would normally require concentration.
