    <text>As a bonus action, you can manifest (or dismiss) an Ethereal Tendril from any point on your body. It has a reach of 10 feet and its Strength score is equal to your Charisma score. You can only have one Ethereal Tendril manifested at a time, and this Tendril can be attacked as part of you. While your Spirit Mantle is active, your Etheral Tendril's reach is doubled.
	The Ethereal Tendril cannot use fine tools, weapons, or shields, but it can be used to manipulate simple objects. Your Tendril can also make Iridescent Strikes, shove, and grapple.

You can release a minor form of the Spirit sealed within you. You learn the find familiar spell, it counts as a Vessel spell for you, you can cast it as a ritual without providing the material component, and it doesn't count against your Spells Known.
	When you cast find familiar, it resembles a tiny version of your Sealed Spirit, shares the creature type of your Archon, can attack on its turn, and uses the Spirit Familiar stat block.

The hunger of your Spirit also fuels your life force. Once per turn while you are in Archon Form, you can forgo one of your attacks to instead force a creature within your reach to make a Charisma saving throw.

You can project immense power. When you turn an Iridescent Strike into a ranged spell attack its range becomes (100/300), it ignores half-cover, and treats three-quarters cover as half.
	In addition, when you hit with a ranged Iridescent Strike, you can expend a Vessel Magic spell slot to create a spiritual eruption. Creatures within 30 feet of your target must make a Dexterity saving throw. They take 6d8 damage of the type of your Iridescent Strike on a failure, and half on a success.
	As you gain Vessel levels the damage of this eruption on impact increases: at 13th level (7d8) and 17th level (8d8)

You reveal a fraction of your Spirit's true power, horrifying all who behold you. When you transform into Archon Form, you can force creatures of your choice that can see you within 60 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, creatures are frightened of you for 1 minute.
	A creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. If the creature is still able to see you it has disadvantage on its saving throw.

The ancient Spirit within you can absorb spells to restore its power. When your Archon sees a creature within 30 feet cast a spell, it can use its reaction to force the spellcaster to make a saving throw with its Spellcasting ability. On a failed save, its spell fails. If the failed spell was a level equal to or higher than your Slot Level, you regain one expended spell slot.
	You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
