Sunlight Sensitivity:
The beast has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and attack rolls that rely on sight when the beast, its target, or whatever it is attempting to perceive is in direct sunlight.

Amphibious Skin:
The beast's skin becomes completely translucent. It gains a swimming speed of 10 feet, and it can breathe air and water.

Arachnoid Grip:
The beast sprouts additional insectoid legs. It gains a 30 foot climbing speed, and it can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down, without needing to make an ability check.

Gnawing Hunger:
The beast grows serrated mouths at the end of each of its limbs. When it deals damage with a natural weapon attack, it gains temporary hit points equal to half the damage dealt.

Insectile Carapace:
The beast grows a chitinous shell or plates in place of its fur or scales. It gains a +2 bonus to its natural Armor Class.

Psionic Awakening:
The beast appears emaciated and its eyes become milky and white. You can cast your Circle of the Depths Spells as normal while in this form.

Quivering Flesh:
The beast's flesh quivers as if it is made of slime or viscous ooze. It can move through gaps as narrow as 1-inch wide without having to squeeze, without expending extra movement.

Unnatural Sight:
The beast has only empty sockets where its eyes would be. It cannot see normally or perceive things normally, but it gains blindsight out to a 10-foot radius.
