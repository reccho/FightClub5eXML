        <name>Greater Familiar (Familiarist (HB))</name>
        <text>When you adopt this Arcane Tradition at 2nd level, you learn to enhance your familiar with your arcane power. When you cast find familiar, you use the Greater Familiar stat block at the end of this Tradition, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) and Intelligence modifier (INT) in several places.
	Each time you conjure your Greater Familiar it gains a number of Arcane Amalgamation features equal to your proficiency bonus from the list at the end of this Tradition. You can change these features each time you conjure it.
	In combat, your Greater Familiar acts during your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but it only takes the Dodge action unless you use your action or bonus action to command it to take an action from its stat block, or another action. If you are incapacitated, your Greater Familiar acts independently to protect you as best as it can.
	Other then the differences described here, your Greater Familiar uses the same features as a normal familiar.

        <text>While almost all wizards study in formal schools under the tutelage of a wise master, some wizards reject traditional arcane schooling and strike out into the world to learn by doing. These rare few who hone their craft out in the wilds are referred to as Hedge Wizards. Though their methods are frowned upon by formal wizarding schools, any archmage worthy of his station will reluctantly recognize that Hedge Wizards are the true masters of the low magics.
	Regardless of their background, all Hedge Wizards reject the traditional methods of wizardry. When creating your Hedge Wizard consider how your spellcasting and spellbook may differ from a wizard who attended a formal school.

To preserve their power, most wizards learn to cast ritual spells, spells that take longer to produce, but aren't as draining on said wizard's magical stamina. Some wizards, known as Ritualists, dedicate their great intellect to mastery over the deliberate and reliable magic of ritual spellcasting.

Any Arcane Elixirs you create appear as Tiny glass vials or flasks of iridescent liquid, and reproduce the spell effect at its lowest possible level.
	As an action, a creature can drink an Elixir, administer an Elixir to a willing creature within 5 feet, or throw an Elixir at a point within 30 feet to produce its spell's effect at the point of impact. If an Elixir's spell effect requires concentration, the creature that drinks it must concentrate on the effect. Elixirs use your wizard spell save DC and spellcasting modifier.
	During each long rest, you can create a number of Arcane Elixirs with a combined spell level equal to your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. At the end of your next long rest, any unused Elixirs become inert and unusable.

When a creature within 60 feet of you ends its turn, you can choose to undo anything that occurred during that creature's turn. The target instantly returns to the space it began its turn, regains any expended spell slots or abilities, and any effects of their actions are undone. The creature then repeats its turn exactly as before, though you are aware of the actions it will take.
	Once you use this reaction to rewind time, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again, unless you expend a spell slot of 6th-level or higher to use it an additional time.

        <text>Though considered barbaric by most wizards, Hemomancy, also known as blood magic, is one of the most powerful and ancient Arcane Traditions. Discovered in ages long forgotten by priests of dark gods, Hemomancers use the power of their own lifeblood to work sinister spells of overwhelming power.

Warning: The Dangers of Blood Magic
The School of Hemomancy has the potential for great power, but at great risk. Any reduction to the already low maximum hit points of a wizard is dangerous, and reducing a player's maximum hit points to 0 causes instant death. This Arcane Tradition is not recommended for beginner players.

Any reduction to your maximum hit points from this feature cannot be reduced in any way.
	You are also able to learn dark magic unknown to most wizards. You can copy any spell you find in a spell scroll or spellbook into your own spellbook, so long as it deals only poison or necrotic damage. Any spell you gain through this feature must be copied into your spellbook in your blood. It then counts as a wizard spell for you if it wasn't already.

This reduction to your hit points cannot be lessened in any way. You cannot use this feature to regain a spell slot higher then 5th-level.
	At the end of each long rest, if your maximum hit points have been reduced by one of your Hemomamcy features, that reduction is reduced by 1. You can also choose to expend Hit Dice at the end of a long rest, reducing any reduction to your hit point maximum by a number of hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).
