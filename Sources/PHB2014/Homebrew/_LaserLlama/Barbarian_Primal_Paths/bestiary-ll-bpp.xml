    <description>This terrifying weapon of evil madness can be activated as an action on your turn, zapping one creature of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target instantly grows a big, bushy moustache measuring up to twice its body size. The affected creature must then roll a d20. On a 5 or lower, it gains a bonus of +5 to any charisma ability checks it makes while having this facial hair on. The moustache lasts for 24 hours, after which it naturally falls out.
