        <text>The Path of the Battlerager was originally published in the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, and is widely accepted as an underwhelming subclass for the Barbarian. The Alternate Battlerager presented here is an attempt to bring this Primal Path up to par with the other official barbarian subclasses.

Optional Rule: Dwarves Only
In some settings, only dwarves can train to become Battleragers known as Kuldjarghs in Dwarvish. The GM can elect to use this restriction depending on the setting and cultures present in the game world.

Over the course of an hour, which can be during a short or long rest, you can use smith's tools to affix spikes to a set of armor, turning it into Spiked Armor.

	• It counts as a martial melee weapon with a reach of 5 feet, and on hit, a Spiked Armor attack deals piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier.

	• While you are Raging, you can use a bonus action on your turn to make a single Spiked Armor attack.

	• When you successfully initiate a grapple, the grappled creature also takes 1d4 piercing damage.

At certain levels, the damage of your Spiked Armor increases: at 5th level (1d6), 11th level (1d8), and 17th level (1d12).

	Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

	Moreover, when you use this feature, you can expend Hit Dice to increase your strength even further. You can expend a total number of your Hit Dice, up to your Strength modifier, multiplying the amount of weight you can move as part of this action by 10 for each Hit Die you expend.
	For each size category you are above Medium, the amount of weight you can move as part of this feature doubles again.
	For example, a Medium sized Barbarian with 20 Strength could expend one Hit Die when they this feature, multiplying their 20 Strength by 60 (50 + 10), to lift up to 1,200 pounds. If they were Large, they would double this to 2,400 pounds.

        <text>Some Barbarians draw their Rage from their ancestry. Those who walk the Path of the Titan fuel their Rage with the giant blood that flows in their veins. While some Titanic warriors are direct descendants of giants, some are unaware of their heritage until it manifests with their Rage. Unusually tall or strong for their race, mortals with giant blood in their veins are fairly obvious once you know the signs to look for.

	• If there is room, you can choose to grow by one size category for the duration of that Rage. For example, you grow from Medium to Large. Your physical size doubles in all dimensions, and your weight is multiplied by eight.

	• Your melee and thrown weapon attacks deal bonus damage depending on your current size: Medium (1d4), Large (1d6), Huge (1d12), and Gargantuan (2d12).

        <text>Hailing from the wild places of the world where the power of nature reigns supreme, Wardens are servants of the natural order who use the raw power of their Rage to channel spirits of the natural world. They often serve as defenders of sacred groves, Druidic Circles, and other places of natural power.

        <name>Primal Magic (Path of the Warden (HB))</name>
        <text>When you adopt this Primal Path, you learn to channel the primal power of spirits to cast spells, much like a Shaman.

Cantrips:
You learn one cantrip of your choice from the Warden spell list. Upon reaching 10th level in this class you learn one additional Warden cantrip of your choice.

Spell Slots:
The Warden Primal Magic table shows how many spell slots you have, and the level of those spell slots. All of your spell slots from this feature are the same level. To cast one of the Warden spells you know of 1st-level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all of your expended spell slots each time you finish a short or long rest.
	For example, when you are 7th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and cast it as a 2nd-level spell.

Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher:
You learn two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warden spell list. The Spells Known column of the Warden Spellcasting table shows when you learn more warden spells of 1st-level or higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level.
	When you gain a level, you can choose a warden spell you know and replace it with another spell from the warden spell list, which must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
	When you reach 7th level, for example, you learn a new Warden spell of your choice, which can be 1st or 2nd-level.

Spellcasting Ability:
As you draw your magic from your connection to primal spirits, Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your warden spells. You use Wisdom when a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, when setting the saving throw DC for a spell, or when making an attack roll with one.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
