    <text>You have trained extensively to counter sinister spellcasters and foil their arcane abilities. You gain the following benefits:

	• When you can see or hear a creature within the reach of a melee weapon you are wielding cast a spell, you can make an opportunity attack against it. On hit, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw as if it were doing so to maintain concentration. On a failure, its spell fails to take effect, and its slot or use of that ability is wasted.

	• If you damage a creature concentrating on a spell, it has disadvantage on its Constitution saving throw to maintain its concentration. This does not stack with the first bullet.

	• You have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by creatures you can see or hear within 5 feet of you.

    <prerequisite>the ability to cast at least one spell</prerequisite>
    <text>You have practiced casting spells in the midst of combat, learning techniques that grant you the following benefits:

	• When you make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, you can use a reaction to add your Spellcasting modifier (minimum of +0) to your roll.

	• You can perform the somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or shields in one or both hands.

	• When you make an opportunity attack, you can cast a spell instead. It must have a casting time of 1 action or 1 attack, and this spell can only target that creature.

	• When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can cast a spell with a casting time of On Hit.

    <prerequisite>proficiency with a martial weapon</prerequisite>
    <text>You have trained to combine your minor magics with weapon attacks. You gain the benefits listed below:

	• Increase your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score by 1, up to a maximum of 20.

	• You learn two Cantrips of your choice from the Magus spell list, choosing Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as your spellcasting ability for these Magus Cantrips.

	• At least one of these Cantrips must deal damage. Once on each of your turns when you make a melee weapon attack, you can imbue the magic of a Magus Cantrip you know into your attack. On hit, you do not deal the normal damage of the Cantrip along with the damage of your weapon attack. Instead, your weapon attack deals the damage type dealt by the Cantrip, and it applies the additional effects of the Cantrip on hit.

	Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can switch your Fighting Style for another Fighting Style of your choice.

Your unarmed strikes deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on hit. If you have two free hands and use your action to make only unarmed strikes you can make a single unarmed strike as a bonus action on that turn.

Featherweight Fighting:
While you are unarmed or wielding only light weapons, and are not wearing medium or heavy armor, your walking speed increases by 10 feet, and you gain a +1 bonus to your damage rolls with light melee weapons and unarmed strikes.

Great Weapon Fighting:
When you make a two-handed melee attack with a heavy weapon as part of your Attack action, you treat a total roll of 5 or lower on the weapon's damage dice as a 6.

Heavyweight Fighting:
You can use your weight, and the weight of your weapon, to land devastating blows. While you are wielding a heavy weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to damage rolls and you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to Shove.

Mounted Warrior:
While you are riding a controlled mount, both you and your mount gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class, and you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to command the mount to take one action from its stat block or another action.
