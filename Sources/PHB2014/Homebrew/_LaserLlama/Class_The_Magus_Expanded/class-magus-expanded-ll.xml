        <text>Magi of the Order of Armorers claim to be the students of the original Magus, the creator of the enchantment which would become the Arcane Armory. While every Order now shares in the knowledge of this enchantment, only Armorers can use it to its fullest potential. These warriors learn to summon their Arcane Armory as deadly projectiles for use in battle.

You can only attack with each levitating blade once per turn. Whenever you can normally make an attack, you can make an attack with one of these levitating blades, then it instantly returns to levitate in your space regardless of a hit or miss.

Wielding the dark powers of the Shadowfell, these warriors wander the world siphoning the life-essence from worthy foes and deadly monsters in order to bring their own sentient weapon into being. For this occult quest, a Hexblade will stop at nothing to meet another skilled warrior in battle.

Sentient Weapon Personalities:
While most Hexblades are evil in their alignment and personality, this is not always the case. Being fueled by life-essence taken from living creatures will always manifest in a Hexblade's personality.
	When deciding on your Hexblade's personality, talk with your DM about your Magus' journey and how would manifests in the sentience you create.

	• Once per turn when you deal necrotic damage to it, you can use a free hand to siphon its life-essence and gain temporary hit points equal to half the necrotic damage dealt. This has no effect on Constructs or Undead.

When you cast hex, your concentration cannot be broken unless you willingly end it. Finally, once between each short or long rest, you can cast hex at 1st-level, without expending a spell slot.

Dire Ward. When the creature under the effects of your hex spell forces you to make a saving throw, you can draw 10 life-essence from your Arcane Armory, expending it to gain advantage on your saving throw. You must choose to use this feature before you roll the d20.

Sinister Spellcasting. Whenever you cast a Hexblade Spell, you can expend life-essence from your Armory in place of expending spell slot. When you do, you expend 10 life-essence per level of the slot used to cast the spell.

Telepathy. The weapon can speak and understand one language of your choice. It can telepathically speak with its wielder, and its wielder can respond telepathically in kind.

Mental Bond. While you hold the weapon in your hand, it lends you its mental abilities. You can concentrate on hex and another spell of your choice (other than hex). If you do so, your concentration on hex still cannot be broken.

The Hexblade's Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores all increase to 16, and the Hexblade can telepathically communicate with and hear creatures within 120 feet of it.
	Your Hexblade also grants you the following benefits:

	• Your attacks with the Hexblade treat a target's damage immunities as resistances and ignore damage resistance.

	• When you Spellstrike with the Hexblade, you can cause the damage of the weapon and spell attack to be necrotic.

High Degree. Your Magus level limits the technicality of Exploits you are able to learn and use. This limit is reflected in the High Degree column of the Spellsword Exploits table.

Exploits. You learn two Martial Exploits of your choice from those available to the Alternate Fighter. You can only use one Exploit per ability check, attack, or saving throw.
	When you gain a Magus level, you can replace one Exploit you know with another Martial Exploit of your choice.

Saving Throws. If an Exploit requires a creature to make a saving throw, its DC is calculated as follows:

        <text>The magic you channel through your weapon attacks supernaturally increases your accuracy. Whenever you make a Spellstrike attack, you can add the level of the spell slot you expend (0 for Cantrips) to all attack rolls you make with that weapon until the end of your turn.
	In addition, when you gain the Spellsunder feature at 9th level, you also gain a bonus to any weapon attack (minimum of 0) you make as part of Spellsunder equal to the level of the spell slot expend (minimum of +1).

        <text>Rather than develop new magics, Spellswords are masters of the signature magics of the Magi. Immediately before or after each weapon attack you make on your turn, you can use your Ethereal Jaunt feature to teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 10 feet of you.
	In addition, your martial skill makes your Magi techniques more accurate. Whenever you make a weapon attack as part of your Spellsunder feature, you can expend an Exploit Die, roll it, and add the result to your Spellsunder attack roll. You must choose to do so before you make your attack roll.

        <text>You stand with the great warriors of legend, a true master of both spell and sword. As a bonus action, you can enter a trance that enhances your combat skills to legendary levels, granting you the benefits listed below for 1 minute:

	• You gain the knowledge and benefits of all the Fighting Styles you learned through your Spellsword's Armory.

	• You can use Spellstrike as part of every attack you make.

	• Once per turn, you can use a Martial Exploit you know without expending an Exploit Die, or cast a Magus spell of 2nd-level or lower without expending a spell slot.

	• The distance of your Ethereal Jaunt is doubled.

This trance ends early if you use a bonus action to end it or you are incapacitated. Once you use this trance, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again. If you have no uses left you can expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.

        <name>Esoteric Order: Order of Travelers</name>
        <text>Practitioners of what many consider a forbidden ninth school of magic, Magi of the Order of Travelers augment their skills with Chronomancy magic, the magic of time. As they grow in their understanding of these secret magic, Travelers become increasingly detached from their place in time, and turning to become strange wanderers who safeguard the flow of time.
	Legends speak of Travelers so skillful in their use of time magic who can conjure future versions of themselves to aid in combat and offer cryptic knowledge from the future. How will your Traveler Magus safeguard the flow of time?

Chronomancy: The Magic of Time:
Introducing time travel to any story, especially one in a game where outcomes are determined by dice rolls, can be risky. Before playing a Traveler Magus, talk with your DM about the implications of these features, especially how they will run Conjure Self.

        <name>Conjure Self (Order of Travelers)</name>
        <text>You have become so adept at the manipulation of time that you can conjure versions of yourself from the future to aid you. As an action, you can expend a spell slot of 3rd-level or higher to conjure a version of yourself from the future.
	Your Future Self shares your initiative in combat and acts immediately after you. They act independently and will aid you to the best of their abilities. Your Future Self has a total number of hit points equal to your maximum hit points and they use your ability scores. They share features from your race, class, and other sources, including independent uses of Temporal Shift. However, you share your spell slots.
	You can ask your Future Self one question concerning the future, and they answer you using the guidelines provided in the commune spell. Their knowledge is limited to things that you may know in the future as determined by the DM.
	The time your Future Self remains depends on the spell slot you expended: 3rd-level (1 minute), 4th-level (1 hour), or 5th-level (8 hours). They return to their time at the end of the duration, or sooner if they are reduced to 0 hit points.
	There can only ever be one version of your Future Self in your current time at once. Conjuring a second Future Self causes any others to instantly return to their time.
