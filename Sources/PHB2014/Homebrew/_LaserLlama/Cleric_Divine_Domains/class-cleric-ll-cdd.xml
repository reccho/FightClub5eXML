        <text>As an action on your turn, you can grasp your holy symbol and cloak yourself in the mantle of your god. For 1 minute, you become invisible and your movement does not produce any sound. This effect instantly ends early if you attack, cast a spell, or force a creature or object to make a saving throw.

        <name>Pilfer Potential (Thieves Domain (HB))</name>
        <text>Your larcenous skills rival those of the gods themselves, and you gain the ability to steal magical potential itself. As an action, you can touch a creature or magic item and steal one of its unexpended spell slots of 5th-level or lower. If you have an expended spell slot of that level, you regain it.
	If you do not have an expended spell slot of that level, you temporarily gain a spell slot of that level, which you must use within the next minute. If you do not use it, it is dispelled.
	Once you use this feature to steal a spell slot you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
	When you use this feature on a creature or object that does not have any unexpended spell slots, it fails, but you do not expend the use of this feature.
