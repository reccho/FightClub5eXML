        <text>One of the most dangerous obsessions an artificer can pursue has always been mechanical flight. Many strive for this lofty goal, and all but the most dedicated, and often the most foolhardy, artificers fail in their pursuits. Experiments that end in disastrous explosions, catastrophic falls from the sky, and deadly malfunctions are not out of the norm for an Aeronaut perfecting their mechanical flying machine.
	You constantly strive to achieve the lofty goal of every Aeronaut, the creation of an arcane flying machine.

	• It can be used as a spellcasting focus by you.

	• It is built to fit you, and can be worn over light armor.

	• When you fall, and aren't incapacitated, you subtract up to 100 feet from your fall when calculating falling damage, and can move 2 feet horizontally every 1 foot you fall.

	• You gain a flying speed of 15 feet, which increases as you gain levels in this class; at 5th level (20 feet), 9th level (30 feet), and in finally at 15th level (60 feet).

	• When you make a weapon attack while at least 5 feet off the ground, you can use your Intelligence, in place of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.

You can only have one Flying Machine at a time, and creating another causes the other to fall into disrepair.

From healing droughts that can mend a wound in moments, to sticky goo that explodes when it comes in contact with open flame. With careful preparation, and a bit of luck, Alchemists are masters of both giving life and leeching it away.

As a bonus action, a creature can drink the Elixir or administer it to a creature within 5 feet. A creature can only be under the effects of one Elixir at a time, and drinking another immediately ends any other Elixir effects.
	Any Elixir you create through this feature lasts until it is consumed, or until the end of your next long rest.

Resilience | The drinker gains a bonus to their Armor Class equal to half your PB for 10 minutes.

        <text>Beginning at 3rd level, you learn to awaken Artificial Minds within objects. At the end of a long rest, you can touch a Tiny, non-magical object, and use your calligrapher's supplies to awaken an Artificial Mind within it. While the Artificial Mind is awakened within an object, it is considered a magic item that requires attunement, and it can be used as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells. If you attempt to rouse a second Artificial Mind while you already have one from this feature, the first Artificial Mind ceases to exist. While attuned to your Artificial Mind, you gain the following abilities:

Information Overload. You can cause your Artificial Mind to overload the mind's of your foes by channelling information at them. As an action, you can force a creature that you can see within 30 feet to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d8 psychic damage and disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the start of your next turn.
	The damage of Information Overload increases when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

Magical Telephony. You can communicate telepathically with any creature carrying one of your infused items within a 1-mile radius. The creature can respond telepathically.

Skill Proficiencies. You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice from the column on the Artificial Mind table. The material of the object determines the skills you choose from, as the object's nature affects the mind's knowledge.

Material | Examples | Skill Proficiencies
Animal | parchment, leather, bone | Animal Handling, Insight, Perception, Survival
Mineral | gems, glass, metal, stone | Deception, Intimidation, Performance, Persuasion
Plant | paper, wood, vegetable | Arcana, History, Nature, Religion

        <text>The degree of control you exert through your Strings grows. Starting at 5th level, when the creature attached to your Marionette Strings makes an attack, you can use your reaction to cause them to make one additional attack.
	In addition, when a creature attached to your Strings hits a creature with a melee attack, you can expend a spell slot to empower their strike. Their strike deals an additional 2d6 force damage for a 1st-level spell slot, and an additional 1d6 force damage for each spell slot level above 1st.

        <text>Your ability to control and amplify the abilities of others has increased. Starting at 9th level, you can have two creatures attached to separate Marionette Strings at one time. You must have a free hand to control each of these creatures. The two creatures can be any distance apart, so long as they each individually remain within the range of your Strings.
	In addition, the length of your Marionette Strings, and the range of your Puppeteer abilities, becomes 60 feet.

        <name>Master Puppeteer (Puppeteer (HB))</name>
        <text>You have become a master amongst Puppeteer artificers. Starting at 15th level, you can use an action on your turn to cast the Irresistible Dance spell, without expending a spell slot, or requiring your concentration. You can only have once instance of this spell active at a time. When a creature makes a saving throw to resist the spell, you can expend a use of your Marionette Strings to impose disadvantage.
	Once you cast Irresistible Dance in this way, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again, or expend a use of your Marionette Strings ability to use this ability again.
