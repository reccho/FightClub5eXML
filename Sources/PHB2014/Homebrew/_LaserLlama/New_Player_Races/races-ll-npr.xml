      <name>Description</name>
      <text>When I was a child I sought out the guardian of my people's ancestral forest. I wandered for days deep within the woods, and I am certain that I never have found the ancient gardener had he wished to remain hidden from me. His true name was too much long for me to comprehend, but he allowed me to call him Whiproot.
	For a year and a day he taught me the ways of the wood, slowly nurturing my druidic potential. Sometimes I still see those ancient green eyes in my dreams. Though I have grown old, I know that the gardener is still out there in the forest of my people, quietly singing to himself as he tends to the trees.
-Zumug, Archdruid of the North

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Elder Gardeners</name>
      <text>Deep in the forests of the world dwell a forgotten people, the Entlings. They are the ancient caretakers of the forest who awoke at the dawn of the world. To many, they are creatures of myth and folktale, reclusive tree-like people with skin like bark and hair that resembles tree-tops and verdant gardens. Though these gardeners are few in number, they are very much real, though they prefer to be forgotten. Most Entlings will happily spend their exceptionally love lives tending to the large swaths of wilderness under their care, learning the names of every root, flower, and tree under their protection.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Shepherds of the Forest</name>
      <text>Entlings care deeply for the plants under their care, and often watch them grow from seedling to fully mature plants. They prefer to spend their lives in quiet harmony with nature, only occasionally interacting with other mortals. They carefully maintain the natural order of the ecosystems they dwell in, culling creatures that grow to numerous, nurturing those on the brink of extinction, and all the relationships in between.
	Though rarely roused to action, Entlings who strike out into the world often do so to protect the forests under their protection. Though slow to anger, their fury knows no bounds when evil or blight threatens the groves that they have raised from seedlings. Entlings who leave the forest usually find it difficult to fit in amongst civilized settlements, and usually struggle to understand the norms and customs of normal folk. Entlings who become adventurers most often train to defend the wild as a ranger or join a local Circle of druids.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Entling Names</name>
      <text>Due to their long lifespans and relaxed disposition, Entling names are often exceptionally detailed stories that can take days to explain. Often, the Entlings that interact with mortals will adopt the name of their favorite plant, tree, or flower.</text>

      <text>Entlings are considered to be adults around the age of 100, and can live to be over 1000 years old if they spend their lives in peace. Hasty Entlings that take up the stressful live of adventuring can shorten their lifespan by up to 500 years.</text>

      <text>From atop the great walls of Hammerdeep I watched as the young half-dwarf disappeared into the swamp. Based on talent along, he should have been chosen as apprentice to the master smith of the great walled city. Sadly, due to his human mother, the young smith had been passed over for a less skilled, but full-blooded dwarf.
	I always admired how he refused to stoop to the menial work delegated to half-dwarves, and I was determined to help him earn the right to use the clan name of his father. I knew the task would be dangerous, especially to a dwarf with so little experience as a warrior, but if the he could succeed in slaying the young dragon that had taken up residence in the swamp, the elders would have no choice but to accept him.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Dwarven Tradition</name>
      <text>Half-dwarves often showcase the best of both of their parents' heritage. Like dwarves, they will usually place high value on honorable conduct and reputation. And, although they are not considered full members of their respective clans, most half-dwarves will go to great lengths to win acceptance, or prevent bringing shame upon the clan of their dwarven parent.
	Often, when a clan has risky or nefarious business to take care of, they will task a half-dwarf with taking care of things. That way, should things go poorly, dishonor is not brought upon a full-blooded member of the clan. Seeking to belong, half-dwarves will go to great lengths to gain the favor of their dwarven relatives. Refusing to deny their human heritage, it is very difficult, and requires great feats of service for a half-dwarf to be recognized by the elders as a member of the clan.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Human Innovation</name>
      <text>From their human heritage, half-dwarves bring the spark of innovation and desire to create a personal legacy. Far more individualistic then other dwarves, their innate desire to push boundaries drives them to innovate on the craftsmanship of both dwarves and humans, often ignoring the traditions of master artisans. Due to their dedication and ingenuity, half-dwarven products are often sought after by those with an eye for quality. Unfortunately, half-dwarves are rarely accepted into dwarven guilds due to dwarven tradition and customs.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Half-Dwarf Names</name>
      <text>Half-dwarves are often given dwarven first names, but either take the last name of their human parent, or adopt the name Stone. Being officially recognized as a member of their clan is seen as the highest honor to be bestowed on a half-dwarf.</text>

	In the Dark Sun setting, half-dwarves are known as Mul, and sadly, due to their natural fortitude and stamina they are prized as gladiators and laborers.</text>

While in the Feywild, Fairies stop maturing, both physically and emotionally, when they reach adulthood, allowing them a strange perpetual immortality.

The fairies who reject a life of unchanging servitude most often do so to become adventurers on the material plane, where they can age and develop normally.

And after all, the village hadn't been attacked by monsters in almost ten summers.

Over the next few months he grew in skill and strength, and by the following summer, Paul was able to best every warrior in the village.
	Just before harvest, a group of evil cultists descended upon the small hamlet. They stole everything of value, and burned anything that couldn't be stolen. At the town's most desperate moment, with the survivors cowered in the armory, the cult's champion issued a challenge. A duel to the death for the lives of the remaining villagers. Without saying a word, Paul drew his sword and stepped forward to defend his home.
-Berthold Cornersnatch
Traveling Bard and Storyteller

In most worlds, humans are the most numerous of the mortal races, and their grit and adaptability allow them to succeed in all but the most hostile environments. Humans can be found in almost any city, town, or hamlet. They live in large social groups, and most humans dwell in permanent settlements.
	Astute humans are those, that have spent their lives honing their mental abilities. They tend to become highly specialized experts in certain subjects, ignoring all other areas of study for the sake of mastery. Some become sages, learning all they can from tomes and scrolls. Others sit at the feet of the wise, seeking to emulate the elders of their clan or temple. And still others master the persuasive arts, honing their social skills.

The wispy and well-educated, scholar from the university of a large city, and the hulking nomadic tribesman from the wilds could share a common relative only two generations back.

      <text>Paul rivers enlisted in the town guard the day he turned sixteen. None of the villagers thought that this was a particularly good idea, but no one had the heart to turn the boy away. And after all, the village hadn't been attacked by monsters in almost ten summers. Paul trained with the rest of the guardsmen, and despite his boyish personality, he was a natural with the sword and spear. Over the next few months he grew in skill and strength, and by the following summer, Paul was able to best every warrior in the village.

Just before harvest, a group of evil cultists descended upon the small hamlet. They stole everything of value, and burned anything that couldn't be stolen. At the town's most desperate moment, with the survivors cowered in the armory, the cult's champion issued a challenge. A duel to the death for the lives of the remaining villagers. Without saying a word, Paul drew his sword and stepped forward to defend his home.

In most worlds, humans are the most numerous of the mortal races, and their grit and adaptability allow them to succeed in all but the most hostile environments. Humans can be found in almost any city, town, or hamlet. They live in large social groups, and most humans dwell in permanent settlements.

Some humans never settle down, and instead spend their lives learning to do a bit of everything. These wanderers are known as Generalists. They become restless if they stay in one place for too long, so they spend their lives experiencing as many things as they possibly can. Generalists usually find their way in the world as wandering entertainers, sell swords, or hired hands. Their desire to experience foreign lands and new cultures often leads them to pursue a life of adventure.

Humans can be found in almost any city, town, or hamlet. They live in large social groups, and most humans dwell in permanent settlements.

By far the most common, Vigorous humans form the down to earth backbone of nearly all human settlements. Hailing from the ranks of farmers and herdsmen, woodsmen and hunters, masons and carpenters, they know the value of a hard day's work. Vigorous humans often leave their humble beginnings to protect their homes and families. Forging their plows into weapons, they embark on lives of adventure. No matter how far they travel, they never forget their humble beginnings.

      <text>Palefang stepped forward into the circle that was already forming around him. He had left the village two moons ago as a hatchling, determined to return and prove his strength. He now sought to challenge the aging chieftain for his position as leader of the clan. The rival lizardfolk he had slain earlier that day had strengthened his reputation enough that the chieftain did not think it disgraceful to accept his challenge. If he won, Palefang would wrest control of the clan, and the other hatchlings would be forced to respect him. As the circle of lizardfolk closed around him and the chieftain, Palefang drew his bone dagger. The chieftain let out a guttural hiss and dropped his cloak from his shoulders, revealing a scaled body covered in scars. The noise of the tribe grew louder and louder in his ears, and for the first time in a long time, Palefang knew fear.

Above all else, Desert Dwelling lizardfolk are cowards. After hundreds of years of being hunted by desert predators these frilled reptilians are few in number, living in tribes less than ten members strong. They always settle in locations with many escape routes should they be attacked while resting.

Grassland Dwelling lizardfolk are brutish tribes of raiders and marauders. They live together in large hordes, and move through their territory as nomadic tribes. Despite a warlike lifestyle, their biggest threat comes from within their ranks. Their leaders are constantly challenged for control, and many of their strongest are slain during internal power struggles.

      <text>Palefang stepped forward into the circle that was already forming around him. He had left the village two moons ago as a hatchling, determined to return and prove his strength. He now sought to challenge the aging chieftain for his position as leader of the clan. The rival lizardfolk he had slain earlier that day had strengthened his reputation enough that the chieftain did not think it disgraceful to accept his challenge. If he won, Palefang would wrest control of the clan, and the other hatchlings would be forced to respect him. As the circle of lizardfolk closed around him and the chieftain, Palefang drew his bone dagger. The chieftain let out a guttural hiss and dropped his cloak from his shoulders, revealing a scaled body covered in scars. The noise of the tribe grew louder and louder in his ears, and for the first time in a long time, Palefang knew fear.

Valuing stealth and quick, decisive strikes over open battle, Jungle Dwelling lizardfolk are experts at remaining unseen until they strike. These ruthless lizardfolk live in secluded places and guard the location of their nests with their lives. They do not discriminate, all trespassers die the same.

      <name>Tribal Warriors</name>
      <text>Lizardfolk are a people unlike any other; feeling no emotion, yet fiercely loyal to their tribe. Their need to prove themselves in battle makes them dangerous neighbors, and they are constantly involved in tribal warfare. Their culture of war has prevented them from advancing past their primitive ways.

Unlike most humanoids, they do not form familial bonds, instead bonding with their tribe. Any lizardfolk would risk their life to protect the hatchlings of their tribe. Even the females that lay clutches of eggs view all of the hatchlings, even those they didn't hatch themselves, as their children.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Honor and Violence</name>
      <text>Lizardfolk society is governed by a strict caste system based on personal reputation. Lizardfolk increase their standing by overcoming enemies that are their equal, or better. They have no interest in fighting the weak, and they will stop at nothing to test their skill in battle against more powerful foes.

Lizardfolk view their lives, and all of their actions, through this lens. After they hatch, they have one year to accomplish enough great deeds to earn their place as an adult member of their tribe. If they fail to meet this expectation they are exiled from the tribe or killed in honor duels by their clutchmates.</text>

By far the most common, Swamp Dweller lizardfolk live in and around great bodies of water. These semi-aquatic folk form small tribes that come together during the full moon to take care of tribal affairs. Unlike most lizardfolk, only resort to violence when it is necessary for their survival.
