  <description>LaserLlama Compendium of Spells.

New Casting Times:
Multiple spells included in the laserllama spell compendium use the new casting times detailed below: On hit and 1 attack.

On Hit:
Spells with the casting time of "on hit" can be cast whenever you hit the specified target with a weapon attack during your turn, much like a Paladin's Divine Smite feature. However, you cannot expend more than one spell slot as part of an attack.

1 Attack:
Spells with the casting time of "1 attack" can be cast in place of an attack, whenever you make an attack during your turn.</description>
