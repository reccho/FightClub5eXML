      <name>The Savant</name>
      <text>An elf cleaned her glasses with the corner of her cloak as the dust settled. The emperor had paid her a large sum to locate this forgotten place, and after months of pouring over ancient maps, she had pieced together the one-lost location of the primeval temple. Now, she had a decision to make. If she reported the location of the temple to her benefactor, it would be ruthlessly stripped of valuables. But, if she kept the location to herself, she could preserve the ancient knowledge contained within. For a savant, knowledge is more precious than any sum of gold.
	An aging human warrior silently assessed the soldiers under his command. They were exhausted and almost out of supplies. It was the tenth night of a brutal siege, and the graying commander knew that no reinforcements were coming to their rescue. He was too old to be of much use in battle, but if his soldiers followed his orders without any hesitation, they might have a chance of survival. He stood up, and for what could very well be his final time, drew his weathered sword from its scabbard.
	A young dwarf bent over his unconscious comrade in the midst of battle, his hands shook as he examined his brother's wounds. His clan had spent a small fortune sending him to study at the finest university in the land. All the hours spent in lectures and libraries, all for this moment. He thought back to his lessons and began to dress his brother's wounds.
	The characters described above are just some examples of the adventuring intellectuals known as Savants. Armed with only their wit, they aid their allies and outwit their enemies.

      <name>Magnificent Minds</name>
      <text>There are many wonderfully intelligent people in the world, but few are true Savants. Born with the innate desire to learn anything they can, and the potential for genius-level intellect, Savants spend their lives learning anything that those around them are willing to teach. Often recognizable at an early age, a Savant's unquenchable hunger for knowledge draws them to the great libraries, universities, and other places of higher learning. They are willing to go to any lengths to unlock the secrets of the world, often turning to lives of adventure. For a Savant, no price is too steep for the promise of discovery.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Intense Focus</name>
      <text>Savants are hyper-focused on their chosen area of study and often become obsessed with learning all they can about their specialty. In their quest for discovery, Savants are willing to set aside any conviction, political, religious, or otherwise, to acquire the information they seek. To them, their desire for knowledge is more important than loyalty to any ideology.
	Often at great personal cost, Savants will not stop their research until they have made a revolutionary discovery in their area of study. It is not unusual to encounter one such scholar far from the safety of a university and its libraries.</text>

      <name>Creating Your Savant</name>
      <text>When creating a Savant, consider their upbringing and the level of their formal education. Were they a star pupil at the finest university gold could buy? Or, were they a child of the streets, fighting for every scrap of knowledge that they could get their hands on? Maybe their mind was trained from birth to be the perfect analytical tool for a noble house or family.
	Also, consider why your Savant would rely on only their intellect rather than use their gifts in pursuit of the arcane or in the service of a higher power. Are they cursed to never be able to produce even the most mundane spell? Or, have they sworn never to rely on the magic that destroyed their family?
	Finally, why did your Savant become an adventurer rather than live the life of an academic? Have they advanced beyond normal study and look forward to the endless discoveries of adventure? Or, have they always been a student of the world?

Quick Build:
You can make a Savant quickly by using these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score, followed by your Dexterity. Second, choose the Noble background.</text>

        <text>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player's Handbook, here's what you need to know if you choose the savant as one of your classes.

Ability Score Minimum:
As a multiclass character, you must have at least the following ability score(s) to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a psion.

	• Intelligence 13

Proficiencies Gained:
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of your new class's starting proficiencies, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a savant.

	• Armor: none
	• Weapons: simple weapons
	• Tools: one set of artisan's tools of your choice
	• Skills: one from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Persuasion or Religion

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Multiclass Features</name>
        <text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does).
	Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared:
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.
	Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
	If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots:
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
	If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.
	For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic:
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

      <feature>
        <name>Adroit Analysis</name>
        <text>You can focus your mind to analyze your foe. Beginning at 1st level, you can use a bonus action to analyze one creature you can see within 60 feet, designating it as your Focus. While it is your Focus, you gain the following benefits against it:

	• When you hit it with an attack, or if you observe it for 1 minute, you learn one of the following characteristics of your choice: its highest ability score, lowest ability score, Armor Class, speed, creature type, or one special sense.

	• You can use your Intelligence, instead of your Strength or Dexterity, for weapon attack and damage rolls against it.

	• Once per turn when you hit it with an attack, you deal 1d6 bonus damage. The bonus increases as you gain levels, to match the Intellect Die column of the Savant table above.

	• Any attacks it makes against you have disadvantage.

It remains your Focus until you choose to end this effect (no action required), or it is hidden from you, if you designate another creature as your Focus, or if you are incapacitated.
	While you have a Focus, you cannot cast or concentrate on spells or use other features that require your concentration.

      <feature>
        <name>Genius Intellect</name>
        <text>Your mind is capable of wondrous bursts of insight, fortitude, and inspiration. At 2nd level, you gain the following benefits:

Intellect Die:
These increased analytical abilities are represented by your Intellect Die, which begins as a d6. You start knowing three such features that make use of this Intellect Die:
Calculated Flourish, Potent Observation, and Wondrous Insight.
	At certain levels, your Intellect Die increases in size, as shown in the Intellect Die column on the Savant table.
	If one of your Intellect Die features requires a creature to make a saving throw, the save DC is calculated as follows:

	Intellect save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Calculated Flourish:
When a creature you can see targets you with a melee attack, you can use a reaction to add one roll of your Intellect Die to your Armor Class against that attack. If this Flourish causes the attack to miss, you can move up to 10 feet as part of the same reaction without provoking opportunity attacks.

Potent Observation:
When another creature that can hear you hits your Focus with an attack, you can use your reaction to grant it a bonus to its damage roll equal to one roll of your Intellect Die.

Wondrous Insight:
When another creature that can hear you makes an ability check using a skill or tool that you are proficient in, you can use your reaction to grant it a bonus to its roll equal to one roll of your Intellect Die. You can do so after it rolls the d20.

Intellect Die Size:
Level | Intellect Die
2nd | d6
5th | d8
11th | d10
17th | d12
