Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Proficiency: simple, light hammer

    <text>"Thermodynamic flux induction circuit design is perhaps the most fascinating branch of practical electrical theory. Although limited to a low-pressure, sub-zero, nitrogen-free environment, the flux induction circuit can still be quite useful. The L.A.L.R. compiler is constructed by the following method: First develop a rigorous elective grammar. When induction elements have NP-completeness, the Krungie factor can be ignored."

After reading this book aloud in a most monotone voice for about a minute or so, you may find that creatures who listened to you speak have fallen asleep.

You can cast the sleep spell at will with a casting time of at least 1 minute, and a range of 15 feet centered on yourself. You will need to be able to physically open and read the contents of this tome aloud, and without interruptions or distractions for the full duration of its casting. For every uninterrupted minute of reading in this manner after the first minute, you can add an additional spell level to the spell in order to increase its effectiveness.
