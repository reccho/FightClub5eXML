        <text>"People fear the Lord of the Nine because they do not understand Him. He is not some powerful force of Evil that seeks to impose his will on mortals like you and I; that would be too simple. He is a being of Hatred, and his Power comes from the hatred that we mortals experience."
"Whenever you act on your anger and hate, you lend Him power. Yet this is not a bad thing; there are many abhorrent things in the world that deserve the focus of our hatred."
â€” Tristan Sagona, High Beacon

A mixture of the Order and Zeal domains.

        <text>At 6th level, you become remarkably adept at channeling magical energy to compel others.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Divine Strike (Samael Domain (HB))</name>
        <text>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

        <name>Samael's Wrath (Samael Domain (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 17th level, enemies you designate for destruction wilt under the combined efforts of you and your allies. If you deal your Divine Strike damage to a creature on your turn, you can curse that creature until the start of your next turn. The next time one of your allies hits the cursed creature with an attack, the target also takes 2d8 psychic damage, and the curse ends. You can curse a creature in this way only once per turn.
