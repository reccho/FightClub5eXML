  <description>Savage and terrifying, trolls stalk nearly every world in the D&amp;D multiverse. While there are many variations, even within a single world, trolls are usually monstrous creatures that prey upon helpless travelers and serve as adversaries to be slain by adventures.

However, the occasional troll may break away from the tendencies of its kin and strike out to make its own fate, often becoming a wandering adventurer. In some settings, trolls are generally less monstrous and prone to evil overall, resulting in many regularly interacting with other races and taking up a life of adventuring. While these troll adventurers typically lack the raw size and power of their classical kin, they make up for it with increased cunning and versatility.</description>
