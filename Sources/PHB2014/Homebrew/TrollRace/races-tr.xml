While there are many variations, even within a single world, trolls are usually monstrous creatures that prey upon helpless travelers and serve as adversaries to be slain by adventures.

The most iconic of which is their regenerative abilities. The degree of healing factor varies between trolls, with the more monstrous trolls able to heal wounds and regrow limbs within seconds. Other trolls have more modest regeneration abilities, which can wane if overtaxed. Nearly all troll regeneration can be halted by fire and acid, and trolls are naturally wary of such elements.

The regenerative abilities of trolls are thought to be responsible for their ability to rapidly mutate and adapt to new environments. Trolls exposed to and damaged by magical emanations or other supernatural forces are prone to taking on aspects of those phenomena when they regenerate. Likewise, clans of trolls living in a particular environment for long periods of time quickly take on physical features that adapt them to their home.</text></trait><trait category="description"><name>Smaller More Adaptable Adventurers</name><text>Most trolls outsize the typical adventurer. They rely on size, strength, and a rapid healing factor to overcome challenges. Troll adventurers tend to be smaller than their classical kin. Some may have simply been the runt of their family, standing a foot or two shorter than the typical troll with underdeveloped claws and regenerative abilities. Others may be the results of extreme mutations or members of their own troll subspecies.

Whatever the case, these troll adventurers have learned to offset their physical deficiencies with greater mental capabilities and specialized training or abilities. They might train in the use of weapons and battle tactics, learn to channel potent magical powers, or gain the aid of gods and supernatural beings. Their natural troll adaptability, combined with the unusual circumstances of their background, makes these adventurers unpredictable but invaluable allies.</text></trait><trait category="description"><name>Primordial Civilizations</name><text>On some worlds, trolls aren't regulated to being savage monsters roaming dangerous wilds. In these settings, trolls maintain their own primal civilization, which blends their savage nature with a collective order that creates a cohesive society. These civilizations are generally very old and often maintain practices that more modern societies would consider barbaric. But the savage aspects of troll society give them more profound insights into the natural world. These societies produce masterful hunters, mystic leaders who call upon primordial spirits for aid, and menageries of trained primordial beasts ready to tear apart any who stand against their troll masters.</text></trait><trait category="description"><name>Troll Names</name><text>While naming conventions can vary significantly from world to world, most trolls put little thought into the niceties of naming convention, and most troll cultures don't even bother with surnames. Trolls who take up a surname usually have one which reflects their deeds, and it usually originates from a nickname given to them by others.
