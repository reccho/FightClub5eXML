    <text>This elegant rapier grants its wielder unparalleled grace in combat. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Duelist Parry: When another creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to add your proficiency bonus to your AC for that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you.

Duelist Riposte: When another creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack against that enemy.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Proficiency: martial, rapier
