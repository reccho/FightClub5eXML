  <!-- Optional Features-->
  <feat>
    <name>Firearm Specialist</name>
    <text>You are adept at using guns effectively.

	• You gain proficiency with Firearms.

	• If you roll a misfire on an attack with a firearm, you can use your reaction to roll a d20. If the number rolled is higher than the weapon's misfire score, the firearm does not misfire. You cannot use this feature of this feat again until you complete a short or long rest.

	• When you use the Attack action and attack with a one-handed weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a loaded firearm with the light property you are holding.
