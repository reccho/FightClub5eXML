  <description>A Horde of New 5th Edition Monsters!

DM: "A collection of hundreds of eyes floats down the corridor toward you, trailing ganglia and dripping caustic fluid that sizzles when it hits the ground. What do you do?"
PLAYER: "I retire, and become a farmer."

Whether you need dungeon vermin or a world-shaking personification of evil, the Tome of Beasts has it. Here are more than 400 new foes for your 5th Edition game-everything from tiny drakes and peculiar spiders, to demon lords and ancient dragons.

Tome of Beasts includes monsters from the entire history of Kobold Press, with longtime favorites such as:

	• Clockwork creatures
	• Drakes and dragons
	• Devils and arch-devils
	• Dangerous flavors of the fey
	• Undead-and much more!

Use them in your favorite published setting, or populate the dungeons in a world of your own creation. Pick up Tome of Beasts and give your players an encounter they won't soon forget!</description>
