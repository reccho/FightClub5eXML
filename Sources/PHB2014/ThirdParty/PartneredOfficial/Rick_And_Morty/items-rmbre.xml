    <text>A concertina is a less charming kind of accordion.
	In addition to knocking out a killer polka, a creature playing the concertina can use an action to cause an area of mist or water up to 30 feet in diameter and 6 inches deep to freeze solid.
	Once used, this feature of the concertina can't be used again until the next dawn.

Any creatures touching the floor must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by the ice. As an action, a restrained creature can attempt to free itself or another creature within its reach from the ice, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. A character freed from the ice is no longer restrained by it. The ice melts in an hour.

If you have proficiency with a given musical instrument, you can add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to play music with the instrument. A bard can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus, substituting it for any material component that does not list a cost. Each type of musical instrument requires a separate proficiency.
	Proficiency with a musical instrument indicates you are familiar with the techniques used to play it. You also have knowledge of some songs commonly performed with that instrument.

History: Your expertise aids you in recalling lore related to your instrument.

Performance: Your ability to put on a good show is improved when you incorporate an instrument into your act.
