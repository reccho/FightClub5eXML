    <text>On a hit with this weapon, the wielder can forgo dealing damage and attempt to trip the target, in which case the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall prone. The DC is 8 + the wielder's Strength modifier + the wielder's proficiency bonus.

This weapon is ornately decorated with elegant details in brimstone and obsidian. It smells of iron and incense. When you attune to this weapon, you must whisper your true name to it. The name sears across the weapon in Infernal runes, then fades.
	The typical True Name, an uncommon item, empowers an illrigger's Baleful Interdict. Whenever you roll an 18, 19, or 20 on your attack roll with this weapon and place a seal on a creature as part of the attack, you can place an additional seal on that creature.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon, and the damage dealt by your seals increases by 1d6.

"The weapon known as True Name is inseparable from the history of the Seven Cities. Whenever two devils entered into a deal with one another, the offeree of the contract would seal their true name into its ornamentations, then the blade would remain in the possession of the offerer. Should the offeree fail to uphold their end of the contract, the offerer would magically learn the name from the blade, thus gaining power over they who betrayed the sacred pact.
	Is there, thus, any blade with more potential? It is written that if an infernal soul could discover the true name of the weapon itself, they could draw from it every name sworn to it since the blade's creation. Imagine the power that individual would have over the Seven Cities. Imagine the proud devils who could do naught but fall to their knees.
	I have sought the blade's name for centuries. With luck, when I find it, its bearer will not know the power they wield, and it will be mine."

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

This crossbow is fitted with a cartridge that can hold up to six crossbow bolts. It automatically reloads after firing until the cartridge runs out of ammunition. Reloading the cartridge takes an action.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Proficiency: simple, light repeating crossbow
