  <description>The Illrigger is MCDM's first custom class for 5th Edition!

Illriggers are versatile armored warriors with a wide array of supernatural abilities that reflect the infernal source of their power. Depending on their contract they can be highly mobile stealthy assassins, heavily armored battlefield commanders, or fighting illusionists.

In addition to the class and three subclass options, The Illrigger contains five new spells, an Illrigger NPC, and three Illrigger retainers compatible with the Followers rules in Strongholds &amp; Followers.

Now go forth, and raise hell!
----
Hell demands victory.

"Ready yourselves. Put doubt behind you. As long as I am in front of you, we are facing victory. You will not fear death, because so long as I live, you die only when I grant permission, and today I am not that forgiving. Our enemies are no match for steel and spell..." Holding the massive steel-devil blade in her right hand, she clenched her left hand into a fist and a glowing, censorious seal manifested there, "...And hellfire!"

The Illrigger isn't a paladin. It isn't a warlock. It's a unique class made for players who want to be a KNIGHT FROM HELL!</description>
