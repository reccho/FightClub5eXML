    <text>Prerequisite: 7th Level Illrigger

As an action, you can expend one or more seals to attempt to bind your awareness to a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw; they can willingly fail this save. On a failed save, you are bound to the target's awareness for a number of hours equal to the number of seals you expended, or until you use this boon on another creature. For the duration, while the target is within 300 feet of you, you can use an action to see and hear through their senses, gaining the benefit of any special senses the target possesses, and you continue to do so until you use your action to return to your normal senses. While perceiving through the target's senses, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.
	Additionally, for the duration, you can place seals, burn them, and use interdict boons as if you were in the creature's space, but doing so makes the creature aware of this bond. An aware creature can use their action to repeat the saving throw, ending the effects of this boon on a success.

As an action, you can touch a creature and expend four seals to attempt to send that creature to Hell. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be pulled through a rift into the prisons of your archfiend's infernal city.
	If the target is native to Hell, or if their level or challenge rating is 4 or lower, they remain there and must find their own way out. Otherwise, the target remains in the prison for 1 minute, after which they reappear in the space they left or in the nearest unoccupied space available; this target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect early on a success.
