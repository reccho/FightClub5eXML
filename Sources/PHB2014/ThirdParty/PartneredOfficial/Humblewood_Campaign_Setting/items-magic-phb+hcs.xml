    <text>Ammo: arrow

A prized hunting weapon among mistral raptors, this bow is imbued with magic to help the wielder see their prey from afar.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
	The bow has 3 charges. When you fire an arrow from this bow, you can speak the command word and use a charge to see through the arrow as a bonus action. You can see from the point your arrow lands as if you were there for 1 minute. If the arrow strikes a creature, you see what they see for the same duration.
	The bow regains 1d3 charges each day at dawn.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.
