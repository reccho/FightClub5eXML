      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Divine Domain: Community Domain</name>
        <text>The community domain focuses on the ties that bind all people together. These are the ties of family and friendship, the ties to ancestors, as well as the ties between elders and the next generation with whom they share their wisdom. The power of the Gods of community is in the security of home and hearth, and the joy of good company. Many such gods teach the value of tradition and simple ways of living in harmony with the natural world. They also tend towards the rule of law, not as a kind of great bureaucracy, but as sacred traditions passed from generation to generation. Some gods advocate the removal of harsh or disruptive forces to this order, and proper sanctions for the violation of the goodwill that any community ought to provide.
	Clerics of such gods value unity, and praise the strength that can be gained when people support each other.

1st | bless, goodberry

        <name>Blessing of the Hearth (Community Domain)</name>
        <text>From 1st level, you gain the ability to conjure a small flagstone hearth with a simple iron cooking pot whenever you rest. This hearth helps warm you and your companions, and can be used to prepare hearty and nutritious meals on the road. If you or any friendly creatures you make camp with would regain hit points at the end of a short rest by spending one or more hit dice, each of those creatures may choose to re-roll one of their resting dice, taking the higher roll between the two.
	Additionally, you gain proficiency with Cook's utensils.

        <name>Channel Divinity: Magnificent Feast (Community Domain)</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you may use your Channel Divinity to conjure a magical feast for the rough road ahead. By spending 10 minutes, you may create a number of delicious, well-prepared, yet simple food items equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). These food items will last up to 8 hours or until the end of a rest, and will never spoil. Eating food created in this way takes an action, providing whomever eats it with healing equal to 2d4 + your cleric level, and can remove either the frightened or poisoned condition from that creature (chosen by the creature when consumed).

        <name>Channel Divinity: Community Watch (Community Domain)</name>
        <text>Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to instill a feeling of vigilant protection in you and your allies. You grant yourself and a number of allies, up to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1), a boon from your deity. Allies must be able to see you and be within 30 feet to receive the boon. Once per round, a creature benefitting from this boon can roll a d6, adding the result to a skill check, saving throw, or attack roll. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 round). A creature can only benefit from this effect if it can see at least one of its allies.

        <name>Divine Strike (Community Domain)</name>
        <text>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon with the power to punish wrongdoing. Once on each of your turns, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 psychic damage to the target. Visions of the evil they have wrought upon others flash before their eyes. You choose whether any foe reduced to 0 hit points by this attack remains stable or dies. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

        <text>At 17th level, your Community Watch grants an additional d6 to each affected ally. It also grants immunity to fear for the duration of the effect. Additionally, your Magnificent Feast produces twice as many foodstuffs, each of which can, when consumed, remove a single curse or disease affecting the target (including attunement to a cursed item).

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Divine Domain: Night Domain</name>
        <text>The night is mysterious, and conceals many unseen dangers. However, the cover of darkness also brings protection from predators and shadows within which one can conceal themselves. The gods of night are varied, encompassing those who would use the cover of darkness to protect others from threats, to those who would use the shadows for wrong doings. The motives of night gods are often shrouded in mystery. Many teach their followers that it is only by peering through the darkness and looking beyond what is hidden that one can attain truth. Clerics of night do their best to keep themselves and their companions safe while journeying through the darkness.

Domain Spells:
At each indicated cleric level, add the listed spells to your spells prepared. They do not count towards your limit.

Night Domain Spells:
Cleric Level | Spells
1st | sleep, veil of dusk*
3rd | darkness, moonbeam
5th | nondetection, globe of twilight*
7th | divination, stellar bodies*
9th | dream, seeming

Spells marked with an asterisk (*) can be found in this book.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Eye of Twilight (Night Domain)</name>
        <text>Beginning at 1st level, a divine blessing grants you the ability to see more clearly in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in magical or nonmagical darkness as if it were only dim light. You can't discern color in the darkness, only shades of gray.
	When you reach 6th level, you can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in magical or nonmagical darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in the darkness, only shades of gray.
	At 8th level, you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical within 120 feet.
	Finally, at 17th level, your eyes are able to see the truth hiding within darkness. You gain the ability to call upon the powers of your deity to grant yourself truesight within 120 feet of you for a number of minutes equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of 1 minute). Your truesight only functions while in conditions of magical or nonmagical darkness. Once you have used this feature, you cannot use it again until you have completed a long rest.

        <name>Ward of Shadows (Night Domain)</name>
        <text>At 1st level, you can create a ward of divine shadows to conceal yourself from an attacking enemy. When attacked by a creature you can see within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, as shadows envelop your form. An attacker that can't be blinded is immune to this feature.
	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once), and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

        <name>Channel Divinity: Invocation of Night (Night Domain)</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to harness the powers of night, clouding the vision of your foes in a shroud of darkness.
	As an action, you present your holy symbol causing any source of mundane or magical light within 30 feet of you to be extinguished.
	Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature who fails the saving throw is blinded for a number of rounds equal to your cleric level. A creature blinded in this way gets a new saving throw at the end of each of its turns to remove the effect. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.

        <name>Veil of Dreams (Night Domain)</name>
        <text>When you reach 8th level, you gain mastery over magical sleep. When you cast the sleep spell, add your cleric level to the dice you roll to determine how many hit points of creatures the spell can affect.
	You may choose the order in which creatures within the spell's area are affected. If the first target chosen has too many hit points to be affected, the spell will instead target the next creature you have chosen that the spell could affect before affecting other targets.
	Additionally, any creature you put to sleep cannot be woken until the start of your next turn. Otherwise, the sleep spell acts as normal.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Creature of the Night (Night Domain)</name>
        <text>Starting at 17th level, you can use your action to activate a supernatural aura of deep night. It lasts for 1 minute, or until you dismiss it using another action. You emit heavily obscuring darkness in a 30-foot radius and lightly obscuring shadows 50 feet beyond that. The darkness and shadows overlap and smother existing sources of light. Only light produced by a 9th level spell or similarly powerful effect can negate the darkness and shadows.
	Enemies within the shadows constantly feel the presence of hungry predators watching them, and become frightened as long as they remain inside the affected area. Enemies in the darkness are both blinded and frightened for as long as they remain within its area.
