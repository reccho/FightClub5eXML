	• You may take the Dash action while gliding to fly an additional distance up to your movement speed.

	• You may change direction freely while gliding, and may gain up to 10 feet of altitude once before you finish your descent.

	• When you are asked to make a saving throw, you may spend your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier as an additional bonus to the saving throw. You cannot use this ability again until you have completed a long rest.

	• During combat, you can use your action to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against any creature you have seen fight. As long as you succeed against a DC of 10 + their challenge rating, you can learn one useful fact of your choice about the target's combat abilities. Choose from:

		• one damage resistance or immunity 
		• one condition immunity 
		• one special ability possessed by the creature that either does damage, or prevents damage 
		• one option under their attack, legendary, or reaction actions 
		• one special sense they possess

    <prerequisite>Glide trait</prerequisite>
    <text>You were either born with great strength, or trained hard to allow yourself to glide under circumstances most would find impossible. You gain the following benefits:

	• You may glide while holding a heavy weapon and wearing heavy armor as long as you aren't encumbered.

	• You may choose to land your glide in a space occupied by a hostile creature that is Large or smaller. If you do so, you may roll an opposed Strength check against the creature. On a success, you push them 10 feet away and knock them prone with the force of your impact. On a failure you land in the nearest un-occupied space.

	• Whenever you successfully use your Sleight of Hand skill outside of combat to steal an object, you may immediately conceal it flawlessly on your person, or put another object you possess in its place.
