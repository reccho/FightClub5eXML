    <text>Spiked armor is a rare type of medium armor made by dwarves. It consists of a leather coat and leggings covered with spikes that are usually made of metal.

You have a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armor, which shimmers softly.
	If you die while wearing the armor, it is destroyed, and each celestial, fey, and fiend with 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be banished to its home plane of existence, unless it is already there.

The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (Dexterity) checks.

Barding is armor designed to protect an animal's head, neck, chest, and body.

Spiked barding provides a mount with an AC equal to 14 + the mount's Dexterity modifier (max 2). The mount makes Dexterity (Stealth) checks with disadvantage.
