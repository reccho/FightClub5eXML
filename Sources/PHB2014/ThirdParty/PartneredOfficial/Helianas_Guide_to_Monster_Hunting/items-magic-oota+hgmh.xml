    <text>Ammo: crossbow bolt

This crossbow is fitted with a cartridge that can hold up to six crossbow bolts. It automatically reloads after firing until the cartridge runs out of ammunition. Reloading the cartridge takes an action.

Sinew harvested from a suneater owlbear's spine can imbue arrows with low-level radiation, which is passed onto a target when struck by the ammunition. The magic of suneater respiration lies in their photometabolism; they can convert sunlight into pure, concentrated radiant energy, unleashing unholy beams of destructive force.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Sunshot: While in sunlight, this bow doesn't need ammunition. If you draw this weapon's bowstring without nocking an arrow, it produces its own ammunition, automatically creating a radiant arrow when you make a ranged attack with it. The attack deals radiant damage instead of the weapon's normal damage. The arrow created by this weapon vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.

Irradiation: A creature that takes radiant damage from this bow becomes magically marked for 1 hour. During this time, it leaves an invisible trail that can be seen by creatures with truesight or creatures using the detect magic spell. The trail fades after 1 hour.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Proficiency: simple, light repeating crossbow

Optional Attunement: If you choose to attune to this weapon, it gains the Solar Beam property and has 3 charges. The sunwing bow regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. If it is exposed to dawn's light, it regains all expended charges instead.

Solar Beam: As an action, you can expend 1 charge to fire a beam of solar energy in a 5-footwide, 60-foot-long line originating from you. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d8 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Optional Attunement: If you choose to attune to this weapon, it gains the Daylight and Solar Beam properties and has 3 charges. The sunwing bow regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. If it is exposed to dawn's light, it regains all expended charges instead.

Solar Beam: As an action, you can expend 1 charge to fire a beam of solar energy in a 5-footwide, 60-foot-long line originating from you. Each creature in the area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d8 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Daylight: When you take the Attack action, you can use one attack to fire a radiant arrow from this bow at a surface within the bow's range and expend 1 charge. A magical effect identical to the daylight spell manifests for 1 hour, centred wherever the arrow strikes the surface.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use.

    <text>On a hit with this weapon, the wielder can forgo dealing damage and attempt to trip the target, in which case the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall prone. The DC is 8 + the wielder's Strength modifier + the wielder's proficiency bonus.

"Stab, bang, hope." If consulted, these are the instructions any kobold will give on using a gunnspier. With a lengthy reload time and complete lack of accuracy, this matchlock-augmented polearm is usable at only one range: point blank. It also comes with a lovely ribbon and a neat basket to hold all your spare shot. Cute.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Point Blank Shot: When you hit a target with an attack using a loaded gunnspier, you can use a bonus action to pull the trigger, firing a plum-sized leaden ball at the target. The attack deals an additional 2d8 bludgeoning damage. As an action, you can reload the gunnspier.

Backfire: When you use Point Blank Shot and roll an 8 on both of the additional bludgeoning damage dice, the gunnspier backfires. Each creature within 10 feet of you (including you) must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 piercing damage as shrapnel erupts from the weapon.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Chomp: The pneumatic-powered dragon's maw can run along the length of the gun's barrel before biting into a target skewered by its point. When you hit a target with an attack using the gunnspier, you can use a bonus action to deal an additional 1d10 piercing damage to it as part of the attack.

Forged as a pair, these magic weapons are crafted from the matching upper and lower jaw bones of a tarrasque. Their innate magic—and one of the reasons the tar-rasque's bite is so powerful—creates an arcanomagnetic pull between the two jawbones, dealing devastating damage to whatever lies between them.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with each of these magic weapons. These weapons deal piercing damage instead of their usual damage type.

Chomp: When you engage in two-weapon fighting using these two weapons and hit the same target with both weapons, the attack you make with your second weapon deals an additional 1d8 damage.

Optional Attunement: You can choose to attune to a pair of jaw breakers. They count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to. When you do so, the weapons gain the Swirling Dervish property while you are attuned to them.

OA: Swirling Dervish: Harnessing the power of the blades, you leap over a target, becoming a tornado of lacerating blades. As an action while you wield both jaw breakers, you can perform a magically-enhanced jump, attacking creatures you pass over. This jump has a maximum distance of 20 feet, is a straight line, must end in an unoccupied space, does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and each foot you clear on the jump costs one foot of movement. You can make one attack against a creature under you in each 5-foot space over which you jump. These attacks always alternate main-hand, then off-hand.
	For example, if you jumped over one Huge creature, you could make three attacks against it (the second one dealing Chomp's extra damage on a hit). If you jumped over three Medium creatures, you could make one attack against each (with no extra damage from Chomp).
