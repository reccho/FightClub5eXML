    <text>A yklwa (pronounced YICK-ul-wah) is a simple melee weapon that is the traditional weapon of Chultan warriors. A yklwa consists of a 3-foot wooden shaft with a steel or stone blade up to 18 inches long. Although it has the thrown weapon property, the yklwa is not well balanced for throwing.

Forged as a pair, these magic weapons are crafted from the matching upper and lower jaw bones of a tarrasque. Their innate magic—and one of the reasons the tar-rasque's bite is so powerful—creates an arcanomagnetic pull between the two jawbones, dealing devastating damage to whatever lies between them.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with each of these magic weapons. These weapons deal piercing damage instead of their usual damage type.

Chomp: When you engage in two-weapon fighting using these two weapons and hit the same target with both weapons, the attack you make with your second weapon deals an additional 1d8 damage.

Optional Attunement: You can choose to attune to a pair of jaw breakers. They count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to. When you do so, the weapons gain the Swirling Dervish property while you are attuned to them.

OA: Swirling Dervish: Harnessing the power of the blades, you leap over a target, becoming a tornado of lacerating blades. As an action while you wield both jaw breakers, you can perform a magically-enhanced jump, attacking creatures you pass over. This jump has a maximum distance of 20 feet, is a straight line, must end in an unoccupied space, does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and each foot you clear on the jump costs one foot of movement. You can make one attack against a creature under you in each 5-foot space over which you jump. These attacks always alternate main-hand, then off-hand.
	For example, if you jumped over one Huge creature, you could make three attacks against it (the second one dealing Chomp's extra damage on a hit). If you jumped over three Medium creatures, you could make one attack against each (with no extra damage from Chomp).

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Proficiency: simple, Yklwa
