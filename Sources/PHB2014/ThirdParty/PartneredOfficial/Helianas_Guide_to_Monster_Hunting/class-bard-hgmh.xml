        <text>Food: it fuels thought, builds bones, and delights the senses. But more than that, breaking bread with a foe can be the beginning of a lasting peace, sculptures of sugar glass can inspire architects to design soaring cities, and the fusion of disparate culinary traditions can tie cultures together. Though we see food every day, it is truly the epitome of inspiration.
	Bards from the College of Cuisine are as prized in the kitchens of nobles as in the mess halls of the rank and file. While peace treaties might be signed over hoisin-glazed duck with sides of spiced jackfruit and crispy shallots, it is the well-fed army that will win the war on a hearty oat and raisin porridge. Such bards never struggle to find employment; they travel where their work is appreciated, be their diners highborn or down-to-earth.

	As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration, teleporting any number of treats on your person next to creatures you can see within 60 feet of you, where they remain, hovering near the creature's mouth. Such a creature can use its reaction to eat the treat, or it can do so on its next turn as a bonus action. Otherwise, the treat falls to the ground.

	• Salty. The creature gains advantage on Wisdom saving throws and is immune to the charmed condition.

	• Sour. The creature's weapon attacks deal bonus acid damage equal to one roll of your Bardic Inspiration die.

        <text>You pursue a particular style of cuisine, choosing from the list below and gaining its feature.

        <text>Your confidence and authority in the kitchen translates to battlefield command. When a creature that can hear you rolls one of your Bardic Inspiration dice or eats one of your Petit Fours, you can shout authoritative, verbal encouragement (no action required). The creature can immediately use its reaction to either make one weapon attack or move up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks. A creature that eats a Petit Fours can attack or move as described as part of the same reaction. action, or bonus action used to eat the Petit Fours.

        <text>If leather is a material, then why not skin itself? Students of the College of Fleshweaving make works of art out of weeping wounds, transform disfigurement into displays of transcendent beauty, and mould flesh into innovative adaptations inspired by the flora and fauna around them. A fleshweaver bard down on their luck might find employment as a battlefield surgeon, while the epitome of a fleshweaver's career is to be the chief facemaker to royalty, altering their visage and physiology through biomantic rituals and deft needlework.

        <name>Malleable Visage (College of Fleshweaving (HB))</name>
        <text>Years spent mending, shaping, and adapting flesh have given you a preternatural ability to modify your own body. You are proficient with surgeon's tools, which you can use as a spellcasting focus, and you know the alter self spell, which counts as a bard spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of bard spells you know. Over the course of 1 minute, you can cast the spell without expending a spell slot, choosing only the Change Appearance option. When you cast the spell in this way, it doesn't require concentration.
	In addition, over the course of 10 minutes, you can use your surgeon's tools to change the appearance of a willing creature. It magically gains the benefits of the Change Appearance effect of the alter self spell, which lasts until it finishes a long rest. After you use your surgeon's tools in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

        <name>Suturer (College of Fleshweaving (HB))</name>
        <text>You know the spiritual weapon spell, which is a bard spell for you, but doesn't count against the number of spells you know. You can cast this spell once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a long rest. When you cast it as a bard spell, the weapon takes the form of a giant needle and thread, and deals piercing damage instead of force damage.
	You also learn different ways to use this spiritual weapon. You gain the Suture benefit below, and you gain an additional benefit below when you reach 5th level and 10th level in this class.

	• Suture (3rd Level). As a bonus action or an action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to move the weapon up to 20 feet and grant temporary hit points equal to one roll of your Bardic Inspiration die to one creature within 5 feet of the weapon. If the creature has 0 hit points, you can stabilise it, instead.

	• Unspool (5th Level). As an action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to move the weapon up to 20 feet and force one creature within 5 feet of the weapon to make a Strength saving throw against your bard spell save DC. On a failure, magical threads wrap around the creature, which is restrained for 1 minute. The target can use its action to repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

	• Acupuncture (10th Level). As an action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to move the weapon up to 20 feet and make a melee spell attack against one creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the creature takes piercing damage equal to one roll of your Bardic Inspiration die plus your Charisma modifier, and must make a Constitution saving throw against your bard spell save DC. On a failure, the creature is paralysed until the end of its next turn.

        <name>Ritual Reskin (College of Fleshweaving (HB))</name>
        <text>Over the course of 10 minutes, you can perform a surgical ritual on creatures that you can see within 60 feet of you (including yourself), up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). The creatures gain one of the following adaptations for the next hour. You choose one adaptation to affect all creatures:

 	• Bull's Buns. The target has advantage on Strength checks, and counts as one size larger when determining its carrying capacity and the weight it can push, drag, or lift.

	• Cactus Skin. The target is covered in razor-sharp spikes. At the end of each of the target's turns, each creature grappling it must make a Constitution saving throw against your bard spell save DC. On a failure, a creature takes piercing damage equal to your Bardic Inspiration die and releases the target from its grapple. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and doesn't have to release the target.

	• Cat's Paws. The target has advantage on Dexterity checks. It also doesn't take damage from falling 20 feet or less if it isn't incapacitated.

	• Fish Form. The target can breathe underwater and gains a swimming speed equal to its walking speed.

	• Owl's Sight. The target has advantage on Wisdom checks and initiative rolls.

	• Rhino's Hide. The target has advantage on Constitution checks and gains temporary hit points equal to one roll of your Bardic Inspiration die plus you Charisma modifier (minimum 1), which are lost when the effect ends.

After you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to use this feature again.

        <name>Soulsew (College of Fleshweaving (HB))</name>
        <text>When a creature uses one of your Bardic Inspiration dice, or fails a saving throw against your Suturer feature's Unspool or Acupuncture effects, it becomes 'soulsewn' to you for 1 minute. While soulsewn, an ethereal thread connects you to this creature via a straight line that only you and creatures with truesight can see. This thread breaks if the creature is ever more than 100 feet away from you.

Spool. You can use a bonus action to teleport to the nearest unoccupied space of a soulsewn creature of your choice, or attempt to switch places with a soulsewn creature. If the creature is unwilling to switch places, you must succeed on a contested Charisma check against the creature. On a success, or if the creature is willing, you and the target teleport, switching places with one another. If there is not enough space for either of you to switch places, you automatically lose the contest.
	You can teleport using this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
