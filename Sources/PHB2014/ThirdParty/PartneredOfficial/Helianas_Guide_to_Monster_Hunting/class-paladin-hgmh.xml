        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of the Harvest (HB)</name>
        <text>The Oath of the Harvest attracts paladins who wish to nourish and heal the world. Often found on aid missions to war-torn lands, such paladins resort to harm only as a means of preventing further suffering. Paladins who swear this oath are more likely than not to heal, feed, and nurture a wounded foe, provided the defeated creature gives its word of honour that it will cease its nefarious activities. They are no fools, however. Typically versed in religion and medicine, these paladins are unlikely to believe the word of creatures inherently inclined to lie, or those that have previously broken their word.

Tenets of the Harvest:
The tenets of the Oath of the Harvest inspire their followers to seek out potential harm and quell it before it blossoms.

Share Your Meal. Your powers are a gift to be shared; if someone is in need, you must use your power to meet those needs. To eat your fill while another goes hungry is selfish.

Nurture Over Cure. Act in the greatest interest of the many. Find ways to prevent harm before it must be healed.

Permit Prosperity. Whether in matters of love, politics, or war, always give your antagonist the opportunity to change and redeem themselves before casting a fatal judgment. A good meal can serve as the backdrop to such events.

Oath Spells:
You gain the oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of the Harvest Spells table. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how oath spells work.

        <name>Aura of Rejuvenation (Oath of the Harvest (HB))</name>
        <text>You emanate an aura that increases the potency of magical healing and hearty meals. Whenever a creature of your choice within 10 feet of you regains hit points from a spell, potion, magical effect, or food, it regains an additional 1d6 hit points.
	When a creature rolls one or more Hit Dice to regain hit points during a short rest, it regains 1 additional hit point for each Hit Dice expended in this way, so long as it spends the majority of the short rest within 10 feet of you.
	When you reach 18th level in this class, the range of the aura increases to 30 feet.

	• At the start of each of your turns, each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you (including you) regains hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1) and gains temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).

	• As bonus action, you can cast the revivify spell without having it prepared and without expending a spell slot (material components are still required).

	• Whenever a creature within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to grant the creature resistance to that damage.
