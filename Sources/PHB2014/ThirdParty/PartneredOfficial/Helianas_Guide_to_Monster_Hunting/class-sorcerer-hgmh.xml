        <name>Sorcerous Origin: Skinshifter (HB)</name>
        <text>Whether it be some distant doppelganger heritage or over-exposure to biomantic magic, your body thrums with the potential for change. Though you may try to channel that power into those around you, the magic that inoculates your body is just as likely to change you, transforming you into a myriad of magical morphs. Will you end up with two left feet and paper-thin skin, or rake through your enemies with toxic claws as spells bounce off of your reflective carapace?

        <name>Skinshift (Skinshifter (HB))</name>
        <text>Your spellcasting stimulates the latent changeability of your body. Immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, roll a d20. If the result is equal to or lower than one-third of your sorcerer level (minimum 1), roll on the Skinshift Adaptations table to magically alter your body in a random way until the end of your next turn. Immediately after you roll on this table, you can spend 1 sorcery point (no action required) to extend the duration of the effect to 10 minutes. If an effect calls for a saving throw, the DC equals your sorcerer spell save DC

On a 4 to 5, you are unaffected. On a 6, you are unaffected, and the effect is reflected back at the caster as though it originated from you, turning the caster into the target.

* See Modify Shift, next page.

** You can only benefit from one of these adaptations at a time. If you gain one of these adaptations while you already benefit from one, the older one is lost.

        <name>Selective Shift (Skinshifter (HB))</name>
        <text>As a bonus action, you can spend 1 or more sorcery points to magically transform your body for the next 10 minutes. For each sorcery point you spend, you gain one adaptation of your choice from the Skinshift Adaptations table, the effects of which last until the transformation ends. The adaptation must have a value in the d20 column equal to or lower than 20 plus half your sorcerer level. If you gain a random skinshift adaptation that replaces one you already had (for example, tumour skin replacing rubber skin), this new adaptation lasts for the duration of the transformation.

        <text>You unleash your inner shapeshifter, allowing your body to react to all manner of environmental stimuli. As bonus action, you can cause a metabolic cascade that transforms your body for 10 minutes, granting you the following effects:

	• All grapple and restraining effects on you immediately end.

	• You gain six adaptations of your choice from the Skinshift Adaptations table. For these, you ignore the restrictions on which adaptations you can have simultaneously.

	• You can't use the Reactive Mutations skinshifter feature, and it ends if it is active.

	• Immediately after you take damage, you gain resistance to that damage type. You can simultaneously sustain three damage resistances in this way; if you gain another resistance from this feature while at your limit, the oldest one is lost.

After you activate this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
