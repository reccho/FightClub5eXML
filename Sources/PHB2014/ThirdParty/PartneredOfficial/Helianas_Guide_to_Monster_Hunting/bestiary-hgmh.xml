    <description>Type: aberration
Creature Component: aboleth or broodmother aboleth
Bonus Tamer Improvement: Genetic Memory and +2 Hit Dice

Encoded within aboleth ichor are the memories of its donor, secreted amongst the fluid's genetic code. In its base state, an aboling makes a functional amphibious companion, with a minor ability to sense the motives of other creatures. Upon bonding and training with a tamer, an aboling can fulfil its potential as a mind reader and repository of knowledge, sharing insights and information its progenitor acquired over its long life.

If any of the aboling's traits or actions require saving throws, it is always against the aboling's save DC, as calculated below.

Save DC = 8 + the tamer's proficiency bonus + the aboling's Constitution modifier

Monster Trainer:
In addition to the improvements you can normally give your companions, you can choose to grant the aboling the following improvements using your Monster Trainer feature:

Genetic Memory:
Prerequisite: become a tamer's companion
Type: Passive (tamer)
While the aboling is summoned, its tamer has proficiency in the History skill. If the tamer is already proficient in this skill, it can add double its proficiency bonus whenever it makes an ability check using this skill. It cannot benefit from a feature that doubles its proficiency bonus with a skill more than once. The aboling gains this improvement when it becomes a companion; it doesn't cost an improvement.

Entrance:
Prerequisite: 3rd-level tamer
Type: Active (action)
As an action, the aboling can target one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed by the aboling for 1 hour. This effect ends early if the aboling dies, is recalled, is on a different plane of existence from the target, or if you or your companions do anything harmful to the target. The charmed creature regards the aboling as a friendly acquaintance. When the effect ends, the creature knows it was charmed by the aboling. Once the aboling uses this action, it can't do so again until its tamer finishes a short or long rest.

Slime:
Prerequisite: 3rd-level tamer
Type: Passive (companion)
The aboling has advantage on any ability checks or saving throws it makes to avoid or escape being grappled or restrained.

Inkjet:
Prerequisite: 5th-level tamer
Type: Active (action)
As an action, the aboling can squirt ink at a creature within 10 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the start of its next turn. The aboling can then move up to half its speed as part of the same action. If this action is taken underwater, immediately before the aboling moves, it creates a 5-foot-radius sphere of heavily obscured water that lasts until the start of its next turn.

After the aboling uses this action, it can't do so again until 10 minutes have passed.

When the aboling's tamer reaches 13th level in the tamer class, the aboling can choose to target all creatures within 10 feet of it, instead of just one creature.

Multiattack:
Prerequisite: 5th-level tamer
Type: Active (action)
As an action, the aboling can make two tentacle attacks.

Rubbery Hide I:
Prerequisite: 5th-level tamer
Type: Passive (companion)
The aboling gains a +2 bonus to its AC while it isn't wearing armor.

Fortified Mind:
Prerequisite: 9th-level tamer
Type: Passive (companion &amp; tamer)
The aboling gains proficiency in Intelligence saving throws. While it is summoned, its tamer also has proficiency in Intelligence saving throws. If its tamer already has this proficiency, the tamer instead gains proficiency in Charisma saving throws.

Infectious Mucous:
Prerequisite: 9th-level tamer, Slime
Type: Active (bonus action)
As a bonus action, the aboling can secrete infectious mucous that lasts until the end of its next turn, choosing one of the diseases from the contagion spell. For the duration, each time the aboling hits a creature with a tentacle attack, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be affected by the contagion spell for 1 hour (concentration not required). In addition, a creature that is grappling the aboling, or a creature that the aboling has grappled, must make a Constitution saving throw at the start of each of the aboling's turns as if it had been hit by a tentacle attack.

Once the aboling uses this bonus action, it can't do so again until its tamer finishes a short or long rest.

Enthral:
Prerequisite: 13th-level tamer, Entrance
Type: Active (action)
As an action, the aboling can target one humanoid or beast it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed by the aboling for 1 minute. The charmed target follows the aboling's commands and can't take reactions. While charmed in this way, the aboling and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance. The aboling can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature," "Run over there," or "Fetch that object." If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from the aboling, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

On its subsequent turns, the aboling must use its action to maintain this effect, or the effect ends. Whenever the charmed target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. This effect also ends early if the aboling dies, is recalled, or is on a different plane of existence from the target.

Once the aboling uses this action, it can't do so again until its tamer finishes a short or long rest.

Rubbery Hide II:
Prerequisite: 13th-level tamer, Rubbery Hide I
Type: Passive (companion)
The aboling gains a +2 bonus to its AC while it isn't wearing armor. This improvement is in addition to the bonus from Rubbery Hide I.

Probing Mind:
Prerequisite: 17th-level tamer, Enthral
Type: Passive (companion)
The aboling is always under the effects of the detect thoughts spell while it is summoned and can relay these read thoughts directly to its tamer while the aboling is within 100 feet of the tamer.

Bonus Tamer Improvement: Growth I and +2 Hit Dice

Like a dragon, but a little less greedy and a little more pliant, dragonlings are Humperdink's attempt at retaining a dragon's useful characteristics and limiting the more... tyrannical ones. Able to shift its makeup depending on the metals to which it is exposed, the dragonling is an adaptable, if distractible, companion.

If any of the dragonling's traits or actions require a saving throw, it is always against the dragonling's save DC, as calculated below.

Save DC = 8 + the tamer's proficiency bonus + the dragonling's Constitution modifier

Monster Trainer:
In addition to the improvements you can normally give your companions, you can choose to grant the dragonling the following improvements using your Monster Trainer feature:

Growth I:
Prerequisite: become a tamer's companion
Type: Passive (companion)
The dragonling's size increases to Small and its Hit Die size increases to a d6 (its hit point maximum consequently increases by 1 for each of its Hit Dice). The damage die of its bite attack increases to a d8. The dragonling gains this improvement when it becomes a companion; it doesn't cost an improvement.

Harden I:
Prerequisite: 3rd-level tamer
Type: Passive (companion)
The dragonling gains a +2 bonus to its AC while it isn't wearing armor.

Breath Weapon I:
Prerequisite: 5th-level tamer
Type: Active (action)
As an action, the dragonling can unleash a torrent of elemental energy. Each creature in an area must make a saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The area, damage type, and saving throw depend on the dragonling's affinity (see its Metallic Character trait):

	• Copper. A 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-long line that requires a Dexterity saving throw and deals acid damage. 	• Gold. A 20-foot cone that requires a Dexterity saving throw and deals fire damage. 	• Magnetite. A 20-foot cone that requires a Dexterity saving throw and deals piercing damage. 	• Silver. A 20-foot cone that requires a Constitution saving throw and deals cold damage. After the dragonling uses this action, it can't do so again until its tamer finishes a short or long rest.

When the dragonling's tamer reaches 9th level in the tamer class, this action's damage increases to 24 (7d6).

Multiattack:
Prerequisite: 5th-level tamer
Type: Active (action)
As an action, the dragonling can make two bite attacks.

Growth II:
Prerequisite: 5th-level tamer, Growth I
Type: Passive (companion)
The dragonling's size increases to Medium and its Hit Die size increases to a d8 (its hit point maximum consequently increases by 1 for each of its Hit Dice). The damage die of its bite attack increases from a d8 to a d10.

Blindsight:
Prerequisite: 9th-level tamer
Type: Passive (companion)
The dragonling gains blindsight to a range of 15 feet.

Harden II:
Prerequisite: 9th-level tamer, Harden I
Type: Passive (companion)
The dragonling gains a +2 bonus to its AC while it isn't wearing armor. This improvement is in addition to the bonus from Harden I.

Breath Weapon II:
Prerequisite: 13th-level tamer, Breath Weapon I
Type: Active (action)
The damage of the dragonling's Breath Weapon action increases to 31 (9d6), the area of the cones increases to 30 feet, and the length of the line increases to 90 feet. The dragonling gains a +1 bonus to the save DC of this action.

When the dragonling's tamer reaches 17th level in the tamer class, the Breath Weapon's damage increases to 42 (12d6).

Growth III:
Prerequisite: 13th-level tamer, Growth II
Type: Passive (companion)
The dragonling's size increases to Large and its Hit Die size increases to a d10 (its hit point maximum consequently increases by 1 for each of its Hit Dice). The damage die of its bite attack increases from a d10 to 2d6.

Wing Attack:
Prerequisite: 17th-level tamer
Type: Active (action)
As an action, the dragonling can beat its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragonling must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + the tamer's proficiency bonus + the dragonling's Strength modifier) or take bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The damage equals 4d6 plus the dragonling's Strength modifier. Creatures larger than the dragonling automatically succeed on this saving throw. The dragonling can then fly up to half its flying speed.

      <text>As an action, the gelatinooze can move up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter the space of creatures smaller than its size. Whenever the gelatinooze enters a creature's space, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw.

On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the gelatinooze. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.

On a failed save, the gelatinooze enters the creature's space, stops moving and engulfs the creature, which takes 7 (2d6) acid damage. The engulfed creature can't breathe, is restrained, and takes 7 (2d6) acid damage at the start of each of the gelatinooze's turns. When the gelatinooze moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. The gelatinooze can have only one creature engulfed at a time.

An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a Strength check against the gelatinooze's save DC. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the gelatinooze.</text>

ooze Creature Component: any polyhedrooze
Bonus Tamer Improvement: Growth I and +2 Hit Dice

A relatively recent creation, the gelatinous polyhedrooze builds on its forebears' mere six sides. Able to more selectively dissolve the objects it engulfs, this companion makes use of the arms and armor found lying around dungeons to form impenetrable barriers of overlapping shields and phalanx-like spears.

If any of the gelatinooze's traits or actions require a saving throw, it is always against the gelatinooze's save DC, as calculated below.

Save DC = 8 + the tamer's proficiency bonus + the gelatinooze's Strength modifier

Monster Trainer:
In addition to the improvements you can normally give your companions, you can choose to grant the gelatinooze the following improvements using your Monster Trainer feature:

Growth I:
Prerequisite: become a tamer's companion
Type: Passive (companion)
The gelatinooze's size increases to Small, it becomes shaped like a d6, its Hit Die size increases to a d6 (its hit point maximum consequently increases by 1 for each of its Hit Dice), and the damage die of its pseudopod attack increases to a d6. The gelatinooze gains this improvement when it becomes a companion; it doesn't cost an improvement.

Reactive Mutations:
Prerequisite: 3rd-level tamer
Type: Active (bonus action)
As a bonus action, the gelatinooze activates its immune system for the next minute. Immediately after the gelatinooze next takes damage, it gains resistance to that damage type for 1 minute.

After the gelatinooze uses this action, it can't do so again until its tamer finishes a long rest.

Engulf:
Prerequisite: 3rd-level tamer
Type: Active (action)
As an action, the gelatinooze can move up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter the space of creatures smaller than its size. Whenever the gelatinooze enters a creature's space, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw.

On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the gelatinooze. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.

On a failed save, the gelatinooze enters the creature's space, stops moving and engulfs the creature, which takes 7 (2d6) acid damage. The engulfed creature can't breathe, is restrained, and takes 7 (2d6) acid damage at the start of each of the gelatinooze's turns. When the gelatinooze moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. The gelatinooze can have only one creature engulfed at a time.

An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a Strength check against the gelatinooze's save DC. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the gelatinooze.

Growth II:
Prerequisite: 5th-level tamer, Growth I
Type: Passive (companion)
The gelatinooze's size increases to Medium, it becomes shaped like a d8, and its Hit Die size increases to a d8 (its hit point maximum consequently increases by 1 for each of its Hit Dice). The damage dice of its pseudopod and spit attacks increase from a d6 to a d8, and its Engulf action's damage increases to 10 (3d6).

Multiattack:
Prerequisite: 5th-level tamer
Type: Active (action)
As an action, the gelatinooze can make two pseudopod attacks.

Spit:
Prerequisite: 5th-level tamer
Type: Active (action)
The gelatinooze gains a ranged weapon attack: Spit. The damage die of the spit attack increases with the specified die size in the gelatinooze's Growth improvements. Spit. 

Ranged Weapon Attack: Str or Dex modifier + PB to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 2d6 + Str or Dex modifier acid damage. Phalanx:
Prerequisite: 9th-level tamer
Type: Active (action)
As an action while the gelatinooze is not in its Turtle form, it can brace itself in place, reducing its speed to 0 feet and presenting a phalanx of spiky things it has found. A creature that hits the gelatinooze with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 2d6 piercing damage. As a bonus action, the gelatinooze can return to normal, regaining its normal speed.

Turtle:
Prerequisite: 9th-level tamer
Type: Active (action)
As an action while the gelatinooze is not in its Phalanx form, it can hunker in place, reducing its speed to 0 feet and presenting a wall of metal and wood on one of its faces. Choose a direction and project a cone as if casting a cone-shaped spell with infinite length; the gelatinooze gains a +10 bonus to AC against all attacks originating from within that cone.

As a bonus action, the gelatinooze can return to normal, regaining its speed and its normal AC.

Growth III:
Prerequisite: 9th-level tamer, Growth II
Type: Passive (companion)
The gelatinooze's size increases to Large, it becomes shaped like a d10, and its Hit Die size increases to a d10 (its hit point maximum consequently increases by 1 for each of its Hit Dice). The damage dice of its pseudopod and spit attacks increase from a d8 to a d10, and its Engulf action's damage increases to 14 (4d6). This growth improvement ignores the normal maximum companion size for a tamer.

Growth IV:
Prerequisite: 13th-level tamer, Growth III
Type: Passive (companion)
The gelatinooze's size increases to Huge, it becomes shaped like a d12, and its Hit Die size increases to a d12 (its hit point maximum consequently increases by 1 for each of its Hit Dice). The damage dice of its pseudopod and spit attacks increase from a d10 to a d12, and its Engulf action's damage increases to 17 (5d6). This growth improvement ignores the normal maximum companion size for a tamer.

Sanctuary:
Prerequisite: 13th-level tamer, Engulf
Type: Active (action) As an action, the gelatinooze can move into the space of an object or willing creature that is smaller than it and encapsulate it within its body. The object or creature can be seen but has total cover. No energy or spell effects that either originate from or target the encapsulated object or creature can pass through the gelatinooze. The gelatinooze naturally diffuses air to the object or creature within it, allowing it to breathe. The gelatinooze can contain up to 1 creature of a size smaller than it, whether it has it engulfed (using the Engulf action) or encapsulated using this trait.

An encapsulated creature can exit the polyhedrooze by expending 2 feet of movement for each foot of gelatinooze that it passes through. As a bonus action, the gelatinooze can expel the object or creature into an adjacent, unoccupied space of the gelatinooze's choice.

Erupt:
Prerequisite: 17th-level tamer, Phalanx or Turtle
Type: Active (action)
As an action, the gelatinooze can fire all the shrapnel, armor, and weapons it has accumulated in its body. It can choose to focus this in a 60-foot cone or erupt in all directions in a 20-foot-radius sphere centred on itself. Each creature in the area other than the gelatinooze must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage, 14 (4d6) piercing damage, 14 (4d6) slashing damage, and 14 (4d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

After the gelatinooze uses this action, it can't use its Erupt, Phalanx, or Turtle actions until it spends 1 hour absorbing rocks, metal, and other bric-a-brac.

Bonus Tamer Improvement: Helpful and +2 Hit Dice

Always keen to offer aid, hyphans make excellent support companions, both on the battlefield and emotionally. Able to calm intense emotions, charm aggressors, and disappear into the earth, they are experts in de-escalation and can aid a party's escape by lacing large areas with necrotising puffballs.

If any of the hyphan's traits or actions require a saving throw, it is always against the hyphan's save DC, as calculated below.

Save DC = 8 + the tamer's proficiency bonus + the hyphan's Constitution modifier

Creature Component: koboldzilla
Bonus Tamer Improvement: Pack Tactics and +2 Hit Dice

From the crude blood-oil of the mecha koboldzilla can be harnessed the progenitor genetic code of the modern kobold. A combination of flesh and metal, the mechakobold retains much of the modern kobold's ingenuity and penchant for mischief. Mechakobolds' belief powers their magical inventions; the force of their personality directly augments their creations. Expect homemade explosions, picked pockets, and the pressing of any big, red buttons.

If any of the mechakobold's traits or actions require a saving throw, it is always against the mechakobold's save DC, as calculated below.

Save DC = 8 + the tamer's proficiency bonus + the mechakobold's Charisma modifier

Monster Trainer:
In addition to the improvements you can normally give your companions, you can choose to grant the mechakobold the following improvements using your Monster Trainer feature:

Pack Tactics:
Prerequisite: become a tamer's companion
Type: Passive (companion)
The mechakobold has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the mechakobold's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated. The mechakobold gains this improvement when it becomes a companion; it doesn't cost an improvement.

Puppy Dragon Eyes:
Prerequisite: 3rd-level tamer
Type: Active (action)
As an action, the mechakobold can stare endearingly at one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the creature can see it, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is charmed by the mechakobold for 1 minute. This effect ends early if the mechakobold harms the creature. If the creature observes the mechakobold acting contrary to the creature's goals, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

After the mechakobold uses this action, it can't do so again until its tamer finishes a short or long rest.

Dynoboom I:
Prerequisite: 5th-level tamer
Type: Active (action)
As an action, the mechakobold can throw a homemade explosive device at a point it can see within 60 feet of it, where it explodes. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

After the mechakobold uses this action, it can't do so again until its tamer finishes a short or long rest, during which it crafts a new explosive device using bits, bobs, and pure belief.

When the mechakobold's tamer reaches 9th level in the tamer class, the damage of this action increases to 24 (7d6).

Growth:
Prerequisite: 5th-level tamer
Type: Passive (companion)
The mechakobold's size increases to Small, its Hit Die size increases to a d6 (its hit point maximum consequently increases by 1 for each of its Hit Dice), and the damage die of its slingshot attack increases to a d8.

Multiattack:
Prerequisite: 5th-level tamer
Type: Active (action)
As an action, the mechakobold can make two slingshot attacks.

Prehensile Tail:
Prerequisite: 9th-level tamer
Type: Passive (companion), Active (bonus action)
The mechakobold gains proficiency with thieves' tools. In addition, it can use its bonus action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check (for example, to pickpocket a creature), to use a set of thieves' tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or to take the Use an Object action.

Nimble Escape:
Prerequisite: 9th-level tamer
Type: Active (bonus action)
The mechakobold can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of its turns.

Dynoboom II:
Prerequisite: 13th-level tamer, Dynoboom I
Type: Active (action)
The damage of the mechakobold's Dynoboom action increases to 31 (9d6), and the size of the explosion increases to a 20-foot-radius sphere. The mechakobold gains a +1 bonus to the save DC of this action.

When the mechakobold's tamer reaches 17th level in the tamer class, the damage of this action increases to 42 (12d6).

Uncanny Dodge:
Prerequisite: 13th-level tamer, Nimble Escape
Type: Active (reaction)
When an attacker that the mechakobold can see hits it with an attack, the mechakobold can use its reaction to halve the attack's damage against it.

Proto-Attunement:
Prerequisite: 17th-level tamer
Type: Passive (companion)
The mechakobold can attune to one magic item, gaining the magic item's benefits. If the mechakobold is wearing or holding this item when it is recalled, the item is recalled with it into the vessel. When it attunes to this item, it becomes bonded to it; however this item doesn't count towards the number of items a companion can be bonded to.

Creature Component: any mimic
Bonus Tamer Improvement: Growth I and +2 Hit Dice

With an appearance like regular household objects and the ability to change shape at will, minimics are easy to lose. Their adhesive epidermis sticks to everything; tamers with minimic companions often have a bottle of solvent on hand. A minimic's ability to keep a foe grappled can be a useful battlefield control tactic, especially when deployed as an inanimate object for ambush operations.

If any of the minimic's traits or actions require a saving throw, it is always against the minimic's save DC, as calculated below.

Save DC = 8 + the tamer's proficiency bonus + the minimic's Constitution modifier.

Monster Tamer:
In addition to the improvements you can normally give your companions, you can choose to grant the minimic the following improvements using your Monster Trainer feature:

Growth I:
Prerequisite: become a tamer's companion
Type: Passive (companion)
The minimic's size increases to Small, its Hit Die size increases to a d6 (its hit point maximum consequently increases by 1 for each of its Hit Dice), and the damage dice of its bite and pseudopod attacks increase to a d6. The minimic gains this improvement when it becomes a companion; it doesn't cost an improvement.

Grappler:
Prerequisite: 3rd-level tamer
Type: Passive (companion)
The minimic has advantage on attack rolls against any creature grappled by it.

Improved Adhesive:
Prerequisite: 3rd-level tamer
Type: Passive (companion)
Creatures grappled by the minimic have disadvantage on ability checks made to escape its grapple.

Growth II:
Prerequisite: 5th-level tamer, Growth I
Type: Passive (companion)
The minimic's size increases to Medium, its Hit Die size increases to a d8 (its hit point maximum consequently increases by 1 for each of its Hit Dice), and the damage dice of its bite and pseudopod attacks increase from a d6 to a d8.

Multiattack:
Prerequisite: 5th-level tamer
Type: Active (action)
As an action, the minimic can make two attacks:
one with its pseudopod and one with its bite.

Regurgitate I:
Prerequisite: 5th-level tamer
Type: Active (action)
As an action, the minimic can regurgitate a torrent of acidic bile. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

After the minimic uses this action, it can't do so again until its tamer finishes a short or long rest.

When the minimic's tamer reaches 9th level in the tamer class, the damage of this action increases to 24 (7d6).

Thick Skin:
Prerequisite: 9th-level tamer
Type: Passive (companion)
The minimic gains a +2 bonus to its AC while it isn't wearing armor.

Acidic Sweat:
Prerequisite: 13th-level tamer
Type: Active (bonus action)
As a bonus action, the minimic can secrete acid. Each creature grappling or grappled by the minimic takes acid damage equal to the minimic's current Hit Die size (1d4, or higher, if it has further Growth improvements).

Regurgitate II:
Prerequisite: 13th-level tamer, Regurgitate I
Type: Active (action)
The damage of the minimic's Regurgitate action increases to 31 (9d6), and the size of the cone increases to 25 feet. The minmic gains a +1 bonus to the save DC of this action.

When the minimic's tamer reaches 17th level in the tamer class, the damage of this action increases to 42 (12d6).

Growth III:
Prerequisite: 17th-level tamer, Growth II
Type: Passive (companion)
The minimic's size increases to Large, its Hit Die size increases to a d10 (its hit point maximum consequently increases by 1 for each of its Hit Dice), and the damage dice of its bite and pseudopod attacks increase from a d8 to a d10.

Bonus Tamer Improvement: Eye Rays I and +2 Hit Dice

Peepers are creatures of hope, optimism, and positive vibes. The ultimate cheerleaders, they are as cowardly as they are encouraging. Their overdeveloped survival instincts kick in whenever a large enough source of fear rears its harrowing head, causing them to flee without hesitation.

If any of the peeper's traits or actions require a saving throw, it is always against the peeper's save DC, as calculated below.

Save DC = 8 + the tamer's proficiency bonus + the peeper's Constitution modifier

Monster Trainer:
In addition to the improvements you can normally give your companions, you can choose to grant the peeper the following improvements using your Monster Trainer feature:

Eye Rays I:
Prerequisite: become a tamer's companion
Type: Active (action)
The peeper learns to use its eye stalks. As an action, the peeper can shoot one of the following magical eye rays at random (roll a d4), targeting a creature it can see within 60 feet of it:

1. Charm Ray. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the peeper for 1 minute, or until the peeper harms the target.

2. Fear Ray. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the peeper until the end of the peeper's next turn.

3. Nightmare Ray. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take 5 (2d4) psychic damage as it is assailed by illusory manifestations of its fears.

4. Wounding Ray. The target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 7 (3d4) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The peeper gains this improvement when it becomes a companion; it doesn't cost an improvement.

Encourager I:
Prerequisite: 3rd-level tamer
Type: Passive (companion)
The size of the peeper's Cone of Encouragement increases to 60 feet and Encourage's bonus increases to a d6.

When the peeper's tamer reaches 9th level in the tamer class, the bonus increases to a d8 and the peeper gains one additional use of Encourage (3/Day).

Immaterial:
Prerequisite: 3rd-level tamer
Type: Active (bonus action)
As a bonus action, the peeper can turn partially incorporeal. Until the start of its next turn, it has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. After the peeper uses this action, it can't do so again until its tamer finishes a short or long rest.

Growth:
Prerequisite: 5th-level tamer
Type: Passive (companion)
The peeper's size increases to Small, its Hit Die size increases to a d6 (its hit point maximum consequently increases by 1 for each of its Hit Dice), and the damage dice of its bite attack and Eye Rays action increase to a d6.

Eye Rays II:
Prerequisite: 5th-level tamer, Eye Rays I
Type: Active (action)
When the peeper uses its Eye Rays action, it shoots two rays at random instead of one (reroll duplicates), choosing one or two targets it can see within 120 feet of it.

Slowing Ray:
Prerequisite: 5th-level tamer
Type: Active (action)
As an action, the peeper can fire a ray at one creature it can see within range of its eye rays (see Eye Rays I &amp; II). The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. To maintain this effect, the peeper must concentrate on it as if it were concentrating on a spell.

After the peeper uses this action, it can't do so again until its tamer finishes a short or long rest.

Telekinetic Ray:
Prerequisite: 9th-level tamer
Type: Active (action)
As an action, the peeper can fire a ray at one object or creature it can see within range of its eye rays (see Eye Rays I &amp; II). If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or the peeper can move it up to 30 feet in any direction. It is restrained by the ray's telekinetic grip until the start of the peeper's next turn or until the peeper is incapacitated.

If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, the peeper can move it up to 30 feet in any direction. The peeper can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.

After the peeper uses this action, it can't do so again until its tamer finishes a short or long rest.

Encourager II:
Prerequisite: 13th-level tamer, Encourager I
Type: Passive (companion)
The size of the peeper's Cone of Encouragement increases to 120 feet and Encourage's bonus increases to a d10. The peeper gains one additional use of Encourage (4/Day). When the peeper's tamer reaches 17th level in the tamer class, Encourage's bonus increases to a d12 and the peeper gains one additional use of Encourage (5/Day).

Incorporeality:
Prerequisite: 13th-level tamer, Immaterial
Type: Passive (companion), Active (bonus action)
While the peeper is under the effect of its Immaterial trait, it can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

Disintegration Ray:
Prerequisite: 17th-level tamer
Type: Passive (companion)
As an action, the peeper can fire a ray at one object or creature it can see within range of its eye rays (see Eye Rays I &amp; II). If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 42 (12d6) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine grey dust.

If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger nonmagical object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.

After the peeper uses this action, it can't do so again until its tamer finishes a long rest.

Bonus Tamer Improvement: Cat's Curse and +2 Hit Dice

We've all heard of a bull in a porcelain shop, but a rakitten is much worse. They can't help but knock off anything close to an edge, especially if it looks delicate and valuable. Fortunately, they make up for this irritating, fiendish behaviour with an ability to control spellcasters, redirecting their spells and cursing them with antimagic properties.

If any of the rakitten's traits or actions require saving throws, it is always against the rakitten's save DC, as calculated as follows:

Save DC = 8 + the tamer's proficiency bonus + the rakitten's Charisma modifier

Monster Trainer:
In addition to the improvements you can normally give your companions, you can choose to grant the rakitten the following improvements using your Monster Trainer feature:

Cat's Curse: Prerequisite: become a tamer's companion
Type: Active (bonus action)
When the rakitten hits a creature with a claw attack on its turn, it can use a bonus action to attempt to afflict the creature with the cat's curse for 1 minute. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be unable to benefit from spells of a level lower than the tamer's proficiency bonus. A creature affected by this curse can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

After the rakitten has used this action, it can't do so again for 1 minute.

The rakitten gains this improvement when it becomes a companion; it doesn't cost an improvement.

Growth I:
Prerequisite: 3rd-level tamer
Type: Passive (companion)
The rakitten's size increases to Small, its Hit Die size increases to a d6 (its hit point maximum consequently increases by 1 for each of its Hit Dice), and the damage die of its claw attack increases to a d6.

Limited Antimagic:
Prerequisite: 3rd-level tamer
Type: Passive (companion)
The rakitten can't be affected or detected by spells of 1st level or lower unless it wishes to be.

When the rakitten's tamer reaches 9th, 13th, and 17th level in the tamer class, the level of spell against which the rakitten can't be affected or detected increases to 2nd, 3rd, and 5th level, respectively.

Rakish Resilience:
Prerequisite: 5th-level tamer
Type: Passive (companion)
The rakitten gains a bonus to its AC equal to its Charisma modifier while it isn't wearing armor.

Multiattack:
Prerequisite: 5th-level tamer
Type: Active (action)
As an action, the rakitten can make two claw attacks.

Weavebender:
Prerequisite: 5th-level tamer
Type: Active (reaction)
As a reaction when a ranged spell attack or a spell with an area of effect centred on a point targets a creature or point within 30 feet of the rakitten, the rakitten can redirect the spell. It can cause a ranged spell attack to target a different creature within 10 feet of the original target (after the attack roll is made but before the outcome is determined), or it can move the area of effect's point of origin up to 10 feet in any direction.

The rakitten can use this reaction a number of times equal to its Charisma modifier. It regains all expended uses when its tamer finishes a long rest.

Growth II:
Prerequisite: 9th-level tamer, Growth I
Type: Passive (companion)
The rakitten's size increases to Medium, its Hit Die size increases to a d8 (its hit point maximum consequently increases by 1 for each of its Hit Dice), and the damage die of its claw attack increases from a d6 to a d8.

Wind Strike:
Prerequisite: 9th-level tamer
Type: Active (no action)
For the next minute, the rakitten can use a bonus action to teleport up to 30 feet to a space it can see. If it makes a claw attack immediately after teleporting and the attack hits, the target takes additional force damage equal to the rakitten's Charisma modifier (minimum 1).

After the rakitten uses this action, it can't do so again until its tamer finishes a long rest.

Devil's Purr:
Prerequisite: 13th-level tamer
Type: Active (action)
As an action, the rakitten lets out a low, thrumming purr. Each creature of the rakitten's choice within 30 feet of it that can hear it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the rakitten until the end of the rakitten's next turn. A creature charmed in this way regards the rakitten as its own offspring, acting protectively towards it. After the rakitten uses this action, it can't do so again until its tamer finishes a short or long rest.

Growth III:
Prerequisite: 17th-level tamer, Growth II
Type: Passive (companion)
The rakitten size increases to Large, its Hit Die size increases to a d10 (its hit point maximum consequently increases by 1 for each of its Hit Dice), and the damage die of its claw attack increases from a d8 to a d10.

Bonus Tamer Improvement: Growth I and +2 Hit Dice

A ferocious beast when roused, this cutie also likes belly rubs, sunbathing, and sweet treats. Be sure not to leave your dust of deliciousness unattended, or you'll have an extremely easyto-beguile owlbear. Such is the sunsnacker's wont.

If any of the sunsnacker's traits or actions require a saving throw, it is always against the sunsnacker's save DC, as calculated below.

Save DC = 8 + the tamer's proficiency bonus + the sunsnacker's Constitution modifier

Monster Trainer:
In addition to the improvements you can normally give your companions, you can choose to grant the sunsnacker the following improvements using your Monster Trainer feature:

Growth I:
Prerequisite: become a tamer's companion
Type: Passive (companion)
The sunsnacker's size increases to Small, its Hit Die size increases to a d6 (its hit point maximum consequently increases by 1 for each of its Hit Dice), and the damage die of its beak attack increases to a d8.

As a bonus action when the sunsnacker is in bright sunlight, it can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see that is also in bright sunlight.

Suneater:
Prerequisite: 9th-level tamer
Type: Active (reaction)
Whenever the sunsnacker would take radiant damage, it can use its reaction to instead take no damage, metabolising the energy and regaining a number of hit points equal to the damage it would have taken after taking into account its resistance to radiant damage. It can use this reaction a number of times equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of once) and regains all expended uses when its tamer finishes a long rest.

Eye Tyrant:
Prerequisite: 13th-level tamer
Type: Active (action)
As an action while in dim light or darkness, the sunsnacker can cause its featherfronds to grow luminous and dance, appearing like a floating eye monster. Each creature within 150 feet of the sunsnacker that can see the sunsnacker but that doesn't know that it isn't an eye monster must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the sunsnacker for 1 hour. A creature frightened in this way must use all its movement to move away from the sunsnacker. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A target that successfully saves is immune to this sunsnacker's Eye Tyrant action for the next 24 hours. The sunsnacker can lower its featherfronds as a bonus action, causing it to cease being luminous and no longer appear like a floating eye monster.

The effect ends early on a creature if the owlbear ceases appearing like a floating eye monster, or if the creature perceives the sunsnacker's true form (for example, if the sunsnacker becomes brightly lit).

Growth III:

The damage of the sunsnacker's Solar Beam action increases to 31 (9d6), and the length of the line increases to 60 feet. The sunsnacker gains a +1 bonus to the save DC of this action.

When the sunsnacker's tamer reaches 17th level in the tamer class, the damage of this action increases to 42 (12d6).

Growth IV:
Prerequisite: 17th-level tamer, Growth III
Type: Passive (companion)
The sunsnacker's size increases to Huge, its Hit Die size increases to a d12 (its hit point maximum consequently increases by 1 for each of its Hit Dice), and the damage dice of its beak attack increases from 2d6 to 2d8.

    <description>Type: elemental
Creature Component: tar-rasque
Bonus Tamer Improvement: Growth I and +2 Hit Dice

Tarlings can draw upon the arcane power source around which they're crafted in order to enhance the decompositive powers innate to tar elementals. They can even manipulate the corpses of the deceased, puppeteering them as flesh suits that can absorb incoming blows. Biomancers posit that such companions can even assume the immense size of tarrasques for a short time.

If any of the tarling's traits or actions require a saving throw, it is always against the tarling's save DC, as calculated below.

Save DC = 8 + the tamer's proficiency bonus + the tarling's Constitution modifier

Monster Trainer:
In addition to the improvements you can normally give your companions, you can choose to grant the tarling the following improvements using your Monster Trainer feature:

Growth I:
Prerequisite: become a tamer's companion
Type: Passive (companion)
The tarling's size increases to Small, its Hit Die size increases to a d6 (its hit point maximum consequently increases by 1 for each of its Hit Dice), and the damage die of its bite attack increases to a d6. The tarling gains this improvement when it becomes a companion; it doesn't cost an improvement.

Arcane Activation:
Prerequisite: 3rd-level tamer
Type: Active (bonus action)
As a bonus action, the tarling can activate its arcane power source for 1 minute. For the duration, the tarling has resistance to necrotic damage and deals an additional 3 (1d6) necrotic damage when it hits a target with a melee attack. After the tarling uses this action, it can't do so again until its tamer finishes a long rest.

Growth II:
Prerequisite: 3rd-level tamer, Growth I
Type: Passive (companion)
The tarling's size increases to Medium, its Hit Die size increases to a d8 (its hit point maximum consequently increases by 1 for each of its Hit Dice), and the damage dice of its bite and tail attacks (see below), as well as its Arcane Activation, increase from a d6 to a d8. This growth improvement ignores the normal maximum companion size for a tamer.

Multiattack:
Prerequisite: 5th-level tamer
Type: Active (action)
The tarling gains two new action options:
Tail and Multiattack. The damage die of the tail attack increases with the specified die size in the tarling's Growth improvements.

Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: Str modifier + PB to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 1d6 + Str modifier bludgeoning damage. Multiattack. As an action, the tarling makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail.

Necrotar Tongue I:
Prerequisite: 5th-level tamer
Type: Active (action)
As an action, the tarling can spew a whip-like tongue of elastic tar at a creature no larger than itself that it can see within 20 feet of it. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become grappled (escape DC equals save DC) by the tarling and be pulled up to 15 feet closer to the tarling. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, takes 9 (2d8) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns, and the tarling can't use its bite attack against a different target. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't grappled, pulled, or restrained.

After the tarling uses this action, it can't do so again until its tamer finishes a short or long rest.

When the tarling's tamer reaches 9th level in the tamer class, the recurring damage of this action increases to 13 (3d8).

Refractive Exterior:
Prerequisite: 5th-level tamer
Type: Passive (companion)
When the tarling is targeted by a magic missile spell or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d4. On a 4, the tarling is unaffected and the energy is refracted into a random elemental type and a bolt of energy fires back at the caster as a ranged spell attack, using the caster's spell attack modifier and dealing damage equal to the tarling's current Hit Die size (see Growth improvements) on a hit. Roll another d4 to determine the damage type: 1-acid, 2-cold, 3-fire, 4-lightning.

Arcane Animation:
Prerequisite: 9th-level tamer, Arcane Activation
Type: Active (action)
As an action, the tarling can reanimate one corpse within 5 feet of it, merging its body with the corpse for the next hour. The corpse must have been a creature with a challenge rating equal to or lower than the tamer's proficiency bonus and been of a size equal to or smaller than the tarling.

For the duration, the tarling gains the non-flying speeds of the corpse's original creature and has two pools of hit points: its own and those from the corpse it inhabits. The corpse's pool of hit points equals half the original creature's hit point maximum. Whenever the tarling takes damage, half of the damage is transferred to the corpse and subtracted from that pool of hit points instead of the tarling's.

If the corpse's pool of hit points is reduced to 0, the reanimation ends and the corpse is destroyed.

After the tarling uses this action, it can't do so again until its tamer finishes a long rest.

Growth III:
Prerequisite: 9th-level tamer, Growth II
Type: Passive (companion)
The tarling's size increases to Large, its Hit Die size increases to a d10 (its hit point maximum consequently increases by 1 for each of its Hit Dice), and the damage dice of its bite and tail attacks (see below), as well as its Arcane Activation, increase from a d8 to a d10. This growth improvement ignores the normal maximum companion size for a tamer.

Growth IV:
Prerequisite: 13th-level tamer, Growth III
Type: Passive (companion)
The tarling's size increases to Huge, its Hit Die size increases to a d12 (its hit point maximum consequently increases by 1 for each of its Hit Dice), and the damage dice of its bite and tail attacks (see below), as well as its Arcane Activation, increase from a d10 to a d12. This growth improvement ignores the normal maximum companion size for a tamer.

Necrotar Tongue II:
Prerequisite: 13th-level tamer, Necrotar Tongue I
Type: Passive (companion)
The range of the tarling's Necrotar Tongue action increases to 40 feet, it can pull the target up to 35 feet closer to it on a failed save, and the damage dealt to the grappled target increases to 18 (4d8) necrotic damage. When the tarling's tamer reaches 17th level in the tamer class, the recurring damage of this action increases to 22 (5d8).

Siege Monster:
Prerequisite: 17th-level tamer, Growth IV
Type: Active (bonus action)
As a bonus action, the tarling can grow to Gargantuan size for 1 minute. It gains a number of temporary hit points equal to its maximum number of Hit Dice, and the damage dice of its bite and tail attacks increase to 4d4. For the duration, the tarling deals double damage to structures and objects.

Titanspawn:
Prerequisite: 17th-level tamer
Type: Passive (companion)
The tarling is immune to the charmed and frightened conditions.
