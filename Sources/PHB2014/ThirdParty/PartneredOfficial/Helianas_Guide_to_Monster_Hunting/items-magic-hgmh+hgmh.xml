Ammo: crossbow bolt

Tommybows are vertically-stacked bows upon a crossbow's chassis, an unwieldy arrangement that reduces their effective range in comparison to their crossbow counterparts.

An ostentatiously ornate tommybow, the goldleaf bows are decorated with an array of bedazzling jewels. Rubies and sapphires sparkle with the fire and ice of the Hells, emeralds carry a vitriolic venom, and the diamonds glow with warm, bright sunlight, a delight peculiar to the pygmy rakshasa.
	This tommybow consists of five vertically stacked bows, each of which sports a pair of matched, randomly determined gemstones. Roll a d4 to determine each bow's gemstone pairs: 1, diamonds; 2, emeralds; 3, rubies; 4, sapphires.

Rakshasa's Revenge: You can use an action to imbue a piece of ammunition with one of the following spells (save DC 15) and fire the ammunition at a point or target within range: daylight (diamond), fireball (ruby), sleet storm (sapphire), or stench (emerald). When the ammunition hits a target or surface, it unleashes the imbued spell centered on that point. These spells do not require concentration. You can choose to fire at a point on a surface or at a target; if you miss the target, the effect is centred on whichever surface the ammunition hits (GM's discretion). The gems are destroyed when the spell is cast and their pieces fall to the ground.

Recharge: You can spend 1 minute replacing a pair of gemstones with diamonds, emeralds, rubies, or sapphires worth at least 100 gp each. So long as the gemstones are matching, then, at the next dawn, they sparkle with arcane power and can be used to imbue the bolts with the associated spells.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

Ammo: crossbow bolt

Tommybows are vertically-stacked bows upon a crossbow's chassis, an unwieldy arrangement that reduces their effective range in comparison to their crossbow counterparts.

Originally fashioned for low-accuracy ride-by assassinations in urban settings, this magical tommybow retains its predecessors'
ability to self-load bolts from an attached magazine, while magically enhancing the attacks to spray splinters of wood and metal towards a target.
	This magical tommybow has 6 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

Splinterspray: As an action, you can pull the trigger extra hard, spending 1 charge, and causing the ammunition to splinter into thousands of woodand-metal shards. Instead of the normal attack against a single target, make separate attack rolls against two creatures within 5 feet of each other. On a hit, a creature takes piercing damage equal to 2d4 (plus any modifiers normally added).

Reload (3): After you make three attacks with this weapon, you must reload it using an action.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon.

Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

Ammo: crossbow bolt

Tommybows are vertically-stacked bows upon a crossbow's chassis, an unwieldy arrangement that reduces their effective range in comparison to their crossbow counterparts.

Originally fashioned for low-accuracy ride-by assassinations in urban settings, this magical tommybow retains its predecessors'
ability to self-load bolts from an attached magazine, while magically enhancing the attacks to spray splinters of wood and metal towards a target.
	This magical tommybow has 12 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

Splinterspray: As an action, you can pull the trigger extra hard, spending 1 charge, and causing the ammunition to splinter into thousands of woodand-metal shards. Instead of the normal attack against a single target, make separate attack rolls against two creatures within 5 feet of each other. On a hit, a creature takes piercing damage equal to 4d4 (plus any modifiers normally added).

Reload (3): After you make three attacks with this weapon, you must reload it using an action.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

    <text>A claw is a simple, bladed melee weapon worn as a glove.

Forged as a pair, these magic weapons are crafted from the matching upper and lower jaw bones of a tarrasque. Their innate magic—and one of the reasons the tar-rasque's bite is so powerful—creates an arcanomagnetic pull between the two jawbones, dealing devastating damage to whatever lies between them.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with each of these magic weapons. These weapons deal piercing damage instead of their usual damage type.

Chomp: When you engage in two-weapon fighting using these two weapons and hit the same target with both weapons, the attack you make with your second weapon deals an additional 1d8 damage.

Optional Attunement: You can choose to attune to a pair of jaw breakers. They count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to. When you do so, the weapons gain the Swirling Dervish property while you are attuned to them.

OA: Swirling Dervish: Harnessing the power of the blades, you leap over a target, becoming a tornado of lacerating blades. As an action while you wield both jaw breakers, you can perform a magically-enhanced jump, attacking creatures you pass over. This jump has a maximum distance of 20 feet, is a straight line, must end in an unoccupied space, does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and each foot you clear on the jump costs one foot of movement. You can make one attack against a creature under you in each 5-foot space over which you jump. These attacks always alternate main-hand, then off-hand.
	For example, if you jumped over one Huge creature, you could make three attacks against it (the second one dealing Chomp's extra damage on a hit). If you jumped over three Medium creatures, you could make one attack against each (with no extra damage from Chomp).

Special: Attached. You can't be disarmed of this weapon, but donning or doffing the weapon takes an action. You can use a hand equipped with a claw to hold items, but can't attack with the claw while doing so. Additionally, you have disadvantage on attack rolls using other weapons held in your clawed hand.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Proficiency: simple, claw

Special: Whirl. When you are wielding the haladie in two hands, you can use a bonus action to attempt to whirl the weapon. To whirl, make a DC 10 Dexterity check, adding your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with haladie. On a success, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn, the whirling blades acting as a barrier against attacks. On a result of 15 or higher, you gain a +2 bonus, instead. On a failure, you deal slashing damage to yourself equal to your proficiency bonus and gain no bonus to your AC from the whirl this turn.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

To flourish, make a DC 13 Dexterity check, adding your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with nunchucks. On a success, you gain a +2 bonus to the first attack roll you make this turn.

Special: Hookpull. As a bonus action immediately after you hit a target no more than one size larger than you with an attack using the tetherhook, you can attempt to hook the target using the tetherhook's reach. Make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, the target is hooked and can't move further away from you. A hooked creature is no longer hooked if you release the tether with both hands, but only one hand is required to keep a creature hooked. A hooked creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics)
check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.
	As part of the bonus action to hook the target, and as a bonus action on any of your subsequent turns while it remains hooked, you can pull the creature 5 feet closer to you. If the target is an object that isn't fixed in place and that weighs less than your push, drag, or lift capacity, you can pull it 5 feet closer to you as a bonus action after you hit it with an attack.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.
