        <text>Through careful preparation, trappers can create both physical and magical traps to ensnare, explode, or enrapture those unlucky enough to find themselves in their vicinity. Trappers are found in all terrains where there are creatures to be hunted. With tact and guile as their companions, a trapper can lay low even the mightiest of prized beasts.

        <name>Trapped Weapons (Trapper (HB))</name>
        <text>When you finish a short or long rest, you can augment one weapon or up to twenty pieces of ammunition that you are holding with a concealed, magical augmentation. You decide whether the augmentation deals acid, cold, fire, or lightning damage. The augmentation lasts until you finish a short or long rest.
	Once per turn, when you hit a target with a weapon attack using the augmented weapon or ammunition, you can activate the concealed augment (no action required). The target of your attack takes 1d8 extra damage of the associated type. At 11th level, you can augment one additional item or up to 20 additional pieces of ammunition when you finish a short or long rest, and the damage increases to 2d8.

        <name>Set Trap (Trapper (HB))</name>
        <text>At 3rd level, and later at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level, you learn how to make new traps, as detailed on the Trapper Traps table, below. Details of these traps can be found in the "Ranger (Trapper): Traps" spell list.

Physical Traps. Creating a physical trap takes 1 hour (which can be done during a short or long rest) and uses trap-making materials (valued in gp) specified in the trap's description. After a physical trap activates, its materials are consumed and the trap can't be used again. However, over the course of 10 minutes, you can salvage half the trap-making materials used in the physical trap's construction if it hasn't activated yet.

Magical Traps. Immediately after you finish a long rest, you can create magical traps—up to a number equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1)—choosing from the options in the "Ranger (Trapper): Traps" spell list. Some of these traps require you to expend spell slots in their creation. When you finish a long rest, all undeployed magical traps lose their effects.

While a physical trap's description specifies how it is activated, you have flexibility in activating your magical traps. When you deploy a magical trap, you can choose a size of creature and a distance of up to 30 feet. When a creature of that size or larger comes within the specified distance, the trap activates. As another option, you can intentionally activate a magical trap within 150 feet of you using a bonus action or a reaction (with no specific trigger).

Trapper Traps:
Ranger Level | Trap Options
3rd | bear trap, snare trap, sole striker
5th | immolation, miasma, soul bin, pit trap
9th | bewilderment, net trap, thunder charge
13th | catapult trap, infection, snapfrost
17th | banisher, gravity well

Deploying a Trap. As an action, you can throw a trap you have created to an unoccupied space you can see on the ground within 30 feet of you, where it arms itself at the start of your next turn. A trap deployed in this way is plainly visible to all creatures. Over the course of 1 minute, you can conceal a trap. A concealed trap can be noticed by a creature that uses its action to make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your ranger save DC and succeeds.

Disarming a Trap. Attempting to move an armed trap causes it to activate, unleashing its effects. A creature within reach of a trap can use its action to make a Dexterity (thieves' tools) check (for physical traps) or a spellcasting ability (Arcana) check (for magical traps) against your ranger save DC. On a success, the trap is disarmed. On a failure, the trap activates and the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes to resist the trap's effects. As an action, you can remotely disarm one of your traps that is within 150 feet of you.

Trap Effects. Spell effects created by a trap don't require concentration. When a trap calls for a saving throw, the DC equals your ranger spell save DC. You can have multiple traps deployed, but any attempt to deploy a magical trap whose centre is within 40 feet of the centre of another magical trap fails. Creatures with truesight or that are under the influence of the detect magic spell can notice a magical trap's presence, even if it has been concealed.

Trap-Making Materials. 1 gp worth of trap-making materials weighs 1 lb.

        <name>Tracker (Trapper (HB))</name>
        <text>You are an expert at detecting and obscuring tracks. When you make an ability check to find or follow tracks, you can add your proficiency bonus to the result of the check, even if you aren't proficient in the relevant skill. If you are already proficient in the relevant skill, your proficiency bonus is doubled for that check.

        <name>Leave No Trace (Trapper (HB))</name>
        <text>You've learnt to use magic to hide traps, allowing them to be concealed in the heat of battle. When you deploy a trap, you can expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to disguise the trap with illusion magic, causing it to become invisible the moment it leaves your hands. Creatures don't see where the trap lands and, if it's a physical trap, have disadvantage on saving throws made to avoid the trap's effects.
	In addition, you learn the invisibility spell, which counts as a ranger spell for you, but doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know. You can cast it once without using a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a short or long rest.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Booby Trap (Trapper (HB))</name>
        <text>You trap your own body against unexpected demise. When you finish a long rest, you can choose one of the following magical effects with which to augment your body until you finish a long rest. After triggering an effect that activates when you are reduced to 0 hit points, that effect can't trigger again until you finish a long rest.

Defibrillate. Once per turn, when a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can trigger an electrical discharge (no action required). The creature is unable to take reactions until the start of its next turn unless it is immune to lightning damage, and you can immediately move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. After you move using this feature, you can't do so again until the start of your next turn.
	When you are reduced to 0 hit points and not killed outright, you can instead drop to 1 hit point and immediately take an extra turn, interrupting the current turn. If you don't regain any hit points before the end of your next turn, you drop to 0 hit points, fall unconscious, and begin making death saving throws as normal.

Dissolve. Once per turn, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can trigger a spurt of acid to coat its weapon or limb (no action required). If the melee attack was a spell attack or made with a natural weapon, the creature takes 1d6 acid damage. If the result of the attack roll meets your AC and is made with a ferrous, non-magical, non-natural weapon, the acid causes the metal to weaken and the weapon is destroyed.
	When you are reduced to 0 hit points, all your concealed acid charges gush outward. Each creature within 10 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your ranger spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d4 acid damage and an additional 5d4 acid damage at the start of each of its turns for the next minute until it uses an action to wipe itself clean. In addition, on a failure, if the creature rolled a 1 on the d20 for its saving throw and is wearing nonmagical, ferrous armor, the armor seizes. While wearing the armor, the creature's speed is halved, its AC is reduced by 2, and it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

Entomb. Once per turn, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can trigger a burst of cold that ripples along the attacker's limb (no action required). The creature takes 1d4 cold damage and its speed is reduced by 15 feet until the end of its next turn unless it is immune to cold damage.
	When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you become entombed in a block of clear ice that has AC 15, 100 hit points, immunity to cold damage, and vulnerability to fire damage. This icy block lasts for 1 minute or until it is destroyed. While the ice persists, you have total cover against all effects and you don't make death saving throws. If you regain 1 or more hit points, the icy block melts at the start of your next turn.

Self-Destruct. Once per turn, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can cause a small, shaped charge to detonate (no action required). You take 1 fire damage and the creature takes 1d8 fire damage.
	When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you erupt in an immense ball of fire and immediately fail one death saving throw. Each creature within 20 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your ranger spell save DC. A creature takes 14d6 fire damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.
