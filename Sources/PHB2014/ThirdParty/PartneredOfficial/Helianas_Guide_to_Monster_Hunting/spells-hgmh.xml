    <text>With a gentle patter, corrosive raindrops build to an acidic deluge in a 20-foot-radius, 60-foot-tall cylinder, centred on a point within range. When the rain begins, each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 acid damage on failure or half as much damage on a success. For the duration, a creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell's area for the first time on its turn or ends its turn there.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the acid damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

    <text>You emit waves of arcanomagnetic energy, distorting the trajectories of ferrous items. For the duration, attacks using ferrous weapons or ammunition made against you have disadvantage. In addition, the area within 20 feet of you is difficult terrain for creatures that are made of ferrous metal or are wearing ferrous armor.

Magnetic Pulse: When you cast this spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can force one Huge or smaller creature that is experiencing this difficult terrain to make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, it takes 1d6 force damage and is knocked prone.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the radius of the difficult terrain increases by 5 feet and the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

    <text>A storm made of crackling lightning and arcanomagnetic winds appears in a location you choose within range. The area of the storm consists of up to ten 10-foot cubes, which you can arrange as you wish and last until the spell ends. Each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube. As a bonus action at the start of each of your turns, you can remove one 10-foot cube, and place another 10-foot cube adjacent to the face of another cube.
	Each creature that starts its turn in the area or enters the area for the first time on its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d8 lightning damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. Each creature that ends its turn in the area must make a Strength saving throw, taking 4d8 force damage and being knocked prone on a failure, or taking half as much damage and not being knocked prone on a success. A creature made of ferrous metal or wearing ferrous armor has disadvantage on this Strength saving throw.
	The area is difficult terrain for any creatures made of ferrous metal or wearing ferrous armor.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the lightning and force damage both increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 7th.

    <text>Enervating energy radiates from you in an aura with a 30-foot radius. Until the spell ends, the aura moves with you, centered on you. Each creature of your choice that enters the aura for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or become drained until the end of its next turn. While drained, a creature must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from each ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes, and any hit points a creature regains are reduced by half.

Each creature that moves within 10 feet of you for the first time on its turn or that starts its turn there must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 3d10 radiant damage and is blinded until the start of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't blinded.

    <text>You draw the bones from all corpses within range, forming a carapace of ribcages and femurs. You gain temporary hit points for each Small or larger corpse wholly or partly within range, according to its size, that last for the duration:

Bone Cage:
Size | Temporary Hit Points Gained
Small | 1d6+1
Medium | 1d8+2
Large | 1d10+5
Huge | 1d12+12
Gargantuan | 1d20+25

As an action on a subsequent turn, you can cause your armor of bones to erupt, expending all remaining temporary hit points. Each other creature within range must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking piercing damage equal to your expended temporary hit points on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. Whatever the manner in which the temporary hit points are lost, the bones shatter and can't be used in this way again.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the radius of this spell increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 5th.

    <text>You call forth an aberration at random from the Anomalies, a distant and bizarre plane. Choose an unoccupied space within range. An aberration of challenge rating 5 or lower (GM's choice) appears in the space. The aberration disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
	The aberration is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the aberration, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the aberration, it defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions.
	If your concentration is broken, the aberration doesn't disappear. Instead, you lose control of the aberration, it becomes hostile towards you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled aberration can't be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th.

    <text>Choose a willing creature you can see within range; it ceases to heed the pained calls of its body, needing neither food nor water to exist. An affected creature ignores the effects of exhaustion, the poisoned condition, and cannot be incapacitated, stunned, paralysed, or fall unconscious. Each time an affected creature takes damage that would reduce its hit points to 0, it makes a death saving throw instead. If the creature fails 3 death saving throws, it dies.
	When the spell ends, the creature gains a level of exhaustion for each death saving throw it failed. If the creature is resurrected after dying from these failed death saving throws, it does not regain consciousness for a duration equal to the time for which this spell affected it. When it wakes, it gains 3 levels of exhaustion.
	If the creature is still alive when the spell ends, it falls unconscious for a duration equal to the time for which this spell affected it. Whilst unconscious in this way, the creature can not be awakened by any means short of a wish spell.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can increase the duration to 10 minutes (6th level), 1 hour (7th level), 8 hours (8th level) or 1 day (9th level).

    <text>You attempt to create violent emotions in a group of people. Each humanoid in a 20-foot-radius sphere centred on a point you choose within range must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. A creature that fails this saving throw becomes enraged for the duration.
	While enraged, a target becomes hostile towards all creatures. An enraged creature that is concentrating on a spell must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns or lose concentration on the spell.
	As an action, you can force an enraged creature to use its reaction to make one melee weapon attack against one randomly determined creature within the enraged creature's reach. If the enraged creature was friendly towards the target of its attack before this spell was cast, the enraged creature can repeat the saving throw immediately after making the attack, ending the effect on itself on a success.
	An enraged creature can repeat the saving throw whenever it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a success. When the spell ends, the creature reverts to its previous disposition again, unless the GM rules otherwise.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher and use an action to force an enraged creature to make a melee weapon attack, you can force one additional enraged creature to make a melee weapon attack for each slot level above 3rd.

On a success, the creature takes half as much damage, you don't learn anything, and the spell ends. The spell also ends if the target is ever outside the spell's range.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the initial and ongoing damage increases by 1d10 and 1d6, respectively, for each slot level above 3rd.

    <text>With an exhalation, fungal spores waft their way towards a point within range. Each creature in a 15-foot-radius sphere centred on that point must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become cursed until the spell ends.

When you cast the spell, choose one of the following fungi to grow on the cursed creatures:

	• Amanita Rotgut. The creature immediately takes 2d6 poison damage and becomes poisoned. While poisoned in this way, the creature takes 2d6 poison damage at the end of each of its subsequent turns.

	• Necrotising Zygomycosis. The creature immediately takes 2d8 necrotic damage, and takes 2d8 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns.

	• Psilocybin Quickitrippiae. The creature begins 'tripping'. It must roll a d4 at the start of each of its turns. On a 1 the creature doesn't move or take actions this turn.

	• Paralysing Mucorales. At the end of each of the creature's turns, it becomes stunned until the start of its next turn. If the creature fails a saving throw against this spell by 5 or more then, if it would be stunned, it is paralysed instead.

	• Raging Henbane. The creature becomes charmed by you and must use its reaction at the start of each of its turns to make one weapon attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach/range other than you.

	• Veiled Lady. The creature's vision darkens to a pinhole; the creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, and ranged attacks have advantage against the creature.

An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns (after the effects of this spell have triggered), ending the effect on itself on a success.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) of Amanita Rotgut and Necrotising Zygomycosis increases by 1d6 and 1d8, respectively, for each slot level above 4th. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can choose two different fungi to grow on affected targets instead of one.

Gravity Pulse: When you cast this spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can create a gravity pulse, forcing one Huge or smaller creature of your choice that you can see within 20 feet of you to make a Strength saving throw. On a failure the creature is pushed 10 feet in a direction of your choice and falls prone, taking 3d6 force damage.

	• Whenever the disfavored target makes an attack roll or saving throw before the spell ends, the disfavored target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack or saving throw.

	• The disfavored target's speed is halved, whilst the favored target's speed increases by half.

These effects end for the pair if either of the target pair is knocked unconscious, killed, or the spell ends. While under the influence of this spell, a favored target can't benefit from the bless spell, and a disfavored target can't be afflicted by the bane spell.

	Whilst poisoned in this way, a creature must roll a d12 at the start of each of its turns. On a 3 or lower, it is racked by a coughing fit and becomes incapacitated until the start of its next turn. Each creature within 5 feet of a creature when it becomes incapacitated in this way must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or also become poisoned in this way for the spell's duration.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 and the value a poisoned creature must roll on the d12 to cause a coughing fit increases by 1 for each slot level above 3rd.

    <text>You cause rapid and unpredictable changes in the internal air pressure of a creature you can see, rupturing its breathing apparatus. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature that is holding its breath makes this saving throw with disadvantage. On a failure, a creature takes 7d6 thunder damage, 7d6 necrotic damage, and immediately begins suffocating. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and does not begin suffocating. A creature suffocating in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending its suffocation on a success.
	A creature that does not need to breathe is immune to the effects of this spell. A greater restoration, heal, or wish spell can restore a creature's ability to breathe, and end its suffocation.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the thunder and necrotic damage both increase by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.

	• Gloves. A creature wearing these gloves gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed and can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, it has advantage on any ability checks it makes related to grappling.

	• Headwear. A creature wearing this headwear doesn't need to breathe, has advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and has resistance to poison damage.

You can end this spell early by touching the item. The spell ends if you cast it again.

    <text>A willing creature you touch gains a preternatural ability to perceive the weaknesses in a creature's defences. The first time the creature makes an attack while under the effect of this spell, it makes the attack with advantage. After it makes an attack, the spell ends.
	This spell augments the creature's ability to strike at vital points when you reach certain levels. When you reach 5th level, the augmented attack scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. At 11th level, this range is increased to 18 to 20, and at 17th level, this range becomes 17 to 20.

    <text>Emanating from a point within range, a noxious, 20-foot-radius sphere of colorless fumes creates a choking, eye-watering miasma that penetrates through creatures' skin.
	When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 3d6 poison damage and becomes poisoned until the end of its next turn on a failure, or takes half as much damage and is not poisoned on a success. Whilst poisoned in this way, a creature has disadvantage on saving throws made to maintain its concentration.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or instantly teleport to your space whilst you teleport to the one it previously occupied.

    <text>One of your arms elongates into a long, wet, suckered tentacle. When you cast this spell, and as an action on each of your turns, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 30 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes 5d8 bludgeoning damage and it must make a Strength saving throw if it is Huge or smaller. On a failure, you can choose one of the following effects:

 	• The target is knocked prone.

	• The target is shoved 5 feet in a direction of your choice.

	• You disarm the target; you take one item the target is holding and return it to your person.

The tentacle also serves as an appendage that can be used like a grappling hook or rope (GM's discretion).

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.

    <text>You touch a quiver containing arrows or bolts, imbuing the ammunition currently in it with the spirit of a creature, plant, or fungus. For the duration, any creature hit (or in the case of 'Hawk', targeted) by one of the pieces of ammunition is subject to the effect of the spirit currently imbuing the quiver (see below), in addition to the attack's normal effects. As a bonus action, you can change which spirit imbues the quiver.

Cat: The target takes an additional 1d6 slashing damage. If the attack roll was made with advantage, the additional damage is increased to 2d6.

Elk: The target takes an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone or shoved 5 feet in a direction of your choice (you choose when the target is hit).

Hawk: The attack ignores half and three-quarters cover.

Hogweed: The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of its next turn.

Psilocybin: The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or begin 'tripping' for the spell's duration. Whilst tripping, the creature must roll a d4 at the start of each of its turns. On a 1, the target is incapacitated until the end of its turn and the effect ends. On a 2-4 the target behaves as normal, and the effect continues.

Roc: The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or its speed becomes 0 and it is lifted 20 feet into the air until the end of its next turn, when it begins falling. If there isn't enough room to be lifted 20 feet, the creature is lifted to the maximum possible height.

Snake: The target takes an additional 1d6 poison damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for the spell's duration. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Spider: The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or become restrained until the end of its next turn. The target can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your spell save DC, ending the effect on itself on a success.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration of this spell is concentration, up to 8 hours.

On a hit, the target takes 1d6 slashing damage and, if the creature is Large or smaller, you can force it to make a Strength saving throw, pulling it up to 10 feet towards the source of water on a failure.

Cantrip Upgrade: The spell's damage increases by 1d6 and the distance it can pull a target increases by 5 feet when you reach 5th level (2d6 and 15 feet), 11th level (3d6 and 20 feet), and 17th level (4d6 and 25 feet).

    <text>You imperceptibly tangle the threads of the Weave in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within range. Whenever a creature attempts to cast a spell of 1st level or higher in this area, it must make an ability check with its spellcasting ability against your spell save DC. On a success, the spell is cast as normal. On a failure, the spellcaster casts the spell and produces an additional effect. Roll a d10 and consult the following table to determine the additional effect:

d10 | Effect
1 | The spellcaster casts gravity smash*
2 | The spellcaster casts phantasmal killer
3 | The spellcaster casts confusion
4 | The spellcaster casts fireball
5 | The spellcaster casts zippit!*
6 | The spellcaster casts web
7 | The spellcaster casts darkness
8 | The spellcaster casts silence
9 | The spellcaster regains 2d10 hit points
10 | The spellcaster doesn't expend a spell slot to cast its spell

Any additional spell cast this way targets or is centred on the spellcaster, who has no control over the spell's effects. The DC for any saving throws equals the spellcaster's spell save DC. In the case of concentration spells, no concentration is required. At initiative count 20 of each round, roll a d20 for each ongoing additional effect. On a roll of 11 or higher, that effect ends.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you increase the radius of the area affected by 10 feet for each slot level above 6th.

If you silence a target that is casting a spell with verbal components, the target's spell slot isn't expended, but its action is wasted.
	At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Strength saving throw as it tries to tear open its mouth. On a success, the target takes 1d8 slashing damage and is no longer silenced. Alternatively, as an action, the target can use a bladed implement to cut open its mouth, taking 1d8 slashing damage and ending the silence.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
