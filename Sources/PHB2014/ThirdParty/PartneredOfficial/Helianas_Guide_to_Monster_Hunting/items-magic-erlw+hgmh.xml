    <text>The double scimitar is the signature weapon of Valenar elves. A haft of fine wood supports a long blade on either end. Forged with techniques honed over tens of thousands of years, these blades are strong, sharp, and remarkably light. Each scimitar is a masterpiece, and as a result the double scimitar is an expensive weapon, but few people ever have an opportunity to purchase one. If you're an elf, your blade could have a long and storied history. If you're not an elf, you might have stolen the weapon from a fallen foe or received it from a dying Valenar ally. If you work with your DM to create the story behind your double scimitar, you can start with the weapon at 1st level in place of a martial weapon normally granted by your class. However, it can be dangerous for a non-elf to carry a double scimitar. Valenar may demand its return or challenge you to prove that you're worthy to wield it.

Hermits of the Springwood, the bonze have as much in common with a druid's love of nature as with the discipline and ritual of the monk. They do not deign to shed the blood of other creatures and thus imbue their training swords, known as bokken, with the power to propel them out of harm's way. The thunderous wind rip is really just a tool for releasing hard-to-reach fruit.
	This magic weapon has 5 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. It deals bludgeoning damage instead of a sword's normal slashing or piercing damage.

Gale: As an action, you can cause a cube of air up to 15 feet on a side to blow with a strong wind until the end of your next turn, dispersing any gasses.

Wind Rip: With a swish, you can send a concussive wave of sound streaking towards a target. When you take the Attack action while holding this blade, you can make ranged spell attacks known as 'wind rips' with the bokken. Wind rips have a range of 30/60 ft., +5 to hit, deal 1d8 thunder damage on a hit, and can be heard up to 100 feet away. On a critical hit, a creature is deafened until the end of its next turn. You can make as many wind rips as you have attacks.

Liftoff: As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge, causing a sustained gust to lift you. Until the end of your current turn, you gain a flying speed of 40 feet. If you are not in contact with the ground or otherwise held aloft at the end of your turn, you fall.

Special: If you attack with a double-bladed scimitar as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to make a melee attack with it. This attack deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit, instead of 2d4.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

The blade of this wicked khopesh is composed of several individual sections linked by a sturdy chain running through the weapon's length. Always dry to the touch, this magical blade appears to continuously absorb any water with which it comes into contact.

Split at the Seams: As a bonus action, you can press a button hidden on the weapon's hilt to cause the sections comprising the blade to magically detach from one another, remaining connected by the chain. Until reformed as a sword as a bonus action, this weapon loses its former sword properties and gains those of a whip.

Unquenchable Thirst: When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, it releases a deadly burst of desiccating, negative energy that drains moisture from a target, forcing it to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 6d6 necrotic damage and is desiccated for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't desiccated. A desiccated creature's skin turns dry and brittle, rupturing with ease, and causing the creature to take an additional 1d4 slashing damage whenever it takes bludgeoning, force, piercing, slashing, or thunder damage. A desiccated creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property has no effect on creatures without skin or on those immune to necrotic damage.

Special: If you attack with a double-bladed scimitar as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to make a melee attack with it. This attack deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit, instead of 2d4.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Forged as a pair, these magic weapons are crafted from the matching upper and lower jaw bones of a tarrasque. Their innate magic—and one of the reasons the tar-rasque's bite is so powerful—creates an arcanomagnetic pull between the two jawbones, dealing devastating damage to whatever lies between them.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with each of these magic weapons. These weapons deal piercing damage instead of their usual damage type.

Chomp: When you engage in two-weapon fighting using these two weapons and hit the same target with both weapons, the attack you make with your second weapon deals an additional 1d8 damage.

Optional Attunement: You can choose to attune to a pair of jaw breakers. They count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to. When you do so, the weapons gain the Swirling Dervish property while you are attuned to them.

OA: Swirling Dervish: Harnessing the power of the blades, you leap over a target, becoming a tornado of lacerating blades. As an action while you wield both jaw breakers, you can perform a magically-enhanced jump, attacking creatures you pass over. This jump has a maximum distance of 20 feet, is a straight line, must end in an unoccupied space, does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and each foot you clear on the jump costs one foot of movement. You can make one attack against a creature under you in each 5-foot space over which you jump. These attacks always alternate main-hand, then off-hand.
	For example, if you jumped over one Huge creature, you could make three attacks against it (the second one dealing Chomp's extra damage on a hit). If you jumped over three Medium creatures, you could make one attack against each (with no extra damage from Chomp).

Special: If you attack with a double-bladed scimitar as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to make a melee attack with it. This attack deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit, instead of 2d4.

From the fossilised teeth of a tar-rasque is extracted the magic of rage and ferocity. Upon attuning to this weapon, you gain the ability to unleash terrifyingly monstrous roars and swing the enormous, bone-handled blade with astounding aggression.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with this magic weapon. This weapon has 5 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 charges daily at dawn.

Ferocious Blow: As an action, you can expend 1 charge to call upon the spirit of the tar-rasque and make a mighty swing with this weapon. If the attack hits, roll four times as many damage dice for the weapon as normal for this attack. This dice multiplication does not affect additional damage from abilities such as smite or sneak attack, and is unaffected by critical hits. If the attack misses, you fall prone and your speed is reduced to 0 feet until the start of your next turn.

Terrorise: As a bonus action, or as part of the bonus action you use to activate the Rage class feature, you can brandish the terrorasque, amplifying your yell with that of a tar-rasque's. Each hostile creature within 60 feet of you that can hear you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you for 1 minute. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect for itself on a success. After you use this property, you can't do so again for 1 hour.

Special: If you attack with a double-bladed scimitar as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to make a melee attack with it. This attack deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit, instead of 2d4.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Proficiency: martial, double-bladed scimitar

    <text>The double scimitar is the signature weapon of Valenar elves. A haft of fine wood supports a long blade on either end. Forged with techniques honed over tens of thousands of years, these blades are strong, sharp, and remarkably light. Each scimitar is a masterpiece, and as a result the double scimitar is an expensive weapon, but few people ever have an opportunity to purchase one. If you're an elf, your blade could have a long and storied history. If you're not an elf, you might have stolen the weapon from a fallen foe or received it from a dying Valenar ally. If you work with your DM to create the story behind your double scimitar, you can start with the weapon at 1st level in place of a martial weapon normally granted by your class. However, it can be dangerous for a non-elf to carry a double scimitar. Valenar may demand its return or challenge you to prove that you're worthy to wield it.
