    <text>Hermits of the Springwood, the bonze have as much in common with a druid's love of nature as with the discipline and ritual of the monk. They do not deign to shed the blood of other creatures and thus imbue their training swords, known as bokken, with the power to propel them out of harm's way. The thunderous wind rip is really just a tool for releasing hard-to-reach fruit.
	This magic weapon has 5 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. It deals bludgeoning damage instead of a sword's normal slashing or piercing damage.

Gale: As an action, you can cause a cube of air up to 15 feet on a side to blow with a strong wind until the end of your next turn, dispersing any gasses.

Wind Rip: With a swish, you can send a concussive wave of sound streaking towards a target. When you take the Attack action while holding this blade, you can make ranged spell attacks known as 'wind rips' with the bokken. Wind rips have a range of 30/60 ft., +5 to hit, deal 1d8 thunder damage on a hit, and can be heard up to 100 feet away. On a critical hit, a creature is deafened until the end of its next turn. You can make as many wind rips as you have attacks.

Liftoff: As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge, causing a sustained gust to lift you. Until the end of your current turn, you gain a flying speed of 40 feet. If you are not in contact with the ground or otherwise held aloft at the end of your turn, you fall.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

    <text>Hermits of the Springwood, the bonze have as much in common with a druid's love of nature as with the discipline and ritual of the monk. They do not deign to shed the blood of other creatures and thus imbue their training swords, known as bokken, with the power to propel them out of harm's way. The thunderous wind rip is really just a tool for releasing hard-to-reach fruit.
	This magic weapon has 5 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. It deals bludgeoning damage instead of a sword's normal slashing or piercing damage.
	You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with melee attacks using this weapon.

Gale: As an action, you can cause a cube of air up to 15 feet on a side to blow with a strong wind until the end of your next turn, dispersing any gasses.

Wind Rip: With a swish, you can send a concussive wave of sound streaking towards a target. When you take the Attack action while holding this blade, you can make ranged spell attacks known as 'wind rips' with the bokken. Wind rips have a range of 30/60 ft., +8 to hit, deal 1d12 thunder damage on a hit, and can be heard up to 100 feet away. On a critical hit, a creature is deafened until the end of its next turn. You can make as many wind rips as you have attacks.

Liftoff: As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge, causing a sustained gust to lift you. Until the end of your current turn, you gain a flying speed of 40 feet. If you are not in contact with the ground or otherwise held aloft at the end of your turn, you fall.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Proficiency: martial, rapier

Wind Rip: With a swish, you can send a concussive wave of sound streaking towards a target. When you take the Attack action while holding this blade, you can make ranged spell attacks known as 'wind rips' with the bokken. Wind rips have a range of 30/60 ft., +9 to hit, deal 2d8 thunder damage on a hit, and can be heard up to 100 feet away. On a critical hit, a creature is deafened until the end of its next turn. You can make as many wind rips as you have attacks.

Liftoff: As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge, causing a sustained gust to lift you. For 1 minute, you gain a flying speed of 60 feet. If you are not in contact with the ground or otherwise held aloft at the end of the spell, you fall.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

    <text>Ammo: crossbow bolt

Sinew harvested from a suneater owlbear's spine can imbue arrows with low-level radiation, which is passed onto a target when struck by the ammunition. The magic of suneater respiration lies in their photometabolism; they can convert sunlight into pure, concentrated radiant energy, unleashing unholy beams of destructive force.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Sunshot: While in sunlight, this bow doesn't need ammunition. If you draw this weapon's bowstring without nocking an arrow, it produces its own ammunition, automatically creating a radiant arrow when you make a ranged attack with it. The attack deals radiant damage instead of the weapon's normal damage. The arrow created by this weapon vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.

Irradiation: A creature that takes radiant damage from this bow becomes magically marked for 1 hour. During this time, it leaves an invisible trail that can be seen by creatures with truesight or creatures using the detect magic spell. The trail fades after 1 hour.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Sinew harvested from a suneater owlbear's spine can imbue arrows with low-level radiation, which is passed onto a target when struck by the ammunition. The magic of suneater respiration lies in their photometabolism; they can convert sunlight into pure, concentrated radiant energy, unleashing unholy beams of destructive force.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Sunshot: While in sunlight, this bow doesn't need ammunition. If you draw this weapon's bowstring without nocking an arrow, it produces its own ammunition, automatically creating a radiant arrow when you make a ranged attack with it. The attack deals radiant damage instead of the weapon's normal damage. The arrow created by this weapon vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.

Irradiation: A creature that takes radiant damage from this bow becomes magically marked for 1 hour. During this time, it leaves an invisible trail that can be seen by creatures with truesight or creatures using the detect magic spell. The trail fades after 1 hour.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon).

Optional Attunement: If you choose to attune to this weapon, it gains the Solar Beam property and has 3 charges. The sunwing bow regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. If it is exposed to dawn's light, it regains all expended charges instead.

Solar Beam: As an action, you can expend 1 charge to fire a beam of solar energy in a 5-footwide, 60-foot-long line originating from you. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d8 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Sinew harvested from a suneater owlbear's spine can imbue arrows with low-level radiation, which is passed onto a target when struck by the ammunition. The magic of suneater respiration lies in their photometabolism; they can convert sunlight into pure, concentrated radiant energy, unleashing unholy beams of destructive force.
	You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Sunshot: While in sunlight, this bow doesn't need ammunition. If you draw this weapon's bowstring without nocking an arrow, it produces its own ammunition, automatically creating a radiant arrow when you make a ranged attack with it. The attack deals radiant damage instead of the weapon's normal damage. The arrow created by this weapon vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.

Irradiation: A creature that takes radiant damage from this bow becomes magically marked for 1 hour. During this time, it leaves an invisible trail that can be seen by creatures with truesight or creatures using the detect magic spell. The trail fades after 1 hour.

Optional Attunement: If you choose to attune to this weapon, it gains the Daylight and Solar Beam properties and has 3 charges. The sunwing bow regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. If it is exposed to dawn's light, it regains all expended charges instead.

Solar Beam: As an action, you can expend 1 charge to fire a beam of solar energy in a 5-footwide, 60-foot-long line originating from you. Each creature in the area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d8 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Daylight: When you take the Attack action, you can use one attack to fire a radiant arrow from this bow at a surface within the bow's range and expend 1 charge. A magical effect identical to the daylight spell manifests for 1 hour, centred wherever the arrow strikes the surface.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Proficiency: simple, light crossbow

Club Music: As an action while holding the lute, you can play one of two brief but powerful songs. Once a song has been played, you can't play that song again until the next dawn.

	â€¢ 1. Panic! at the Tavern: You let loose a fast, chaotic melody that sows panic in the minds of your foes, forcing each creature of your choice within 15 feet of you that can hear you to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 psychic damage and is frightened of you for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't frightened. A creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

	â€¢ 2. Mithrallica: You unleash an ear-shattering power chord that blows your foes away, forcing each creature in a 25-foot cone to make a DC 16 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 thunder damage and is pushed 20 feet away from you, knocked prone, and deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects. A creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the deafened condition on itself on a success.

    <text>Burning with ravenous hunger and unquenchable hanger, this mimic-infused weapon struggles relentlessly against the sturdy iron chains that bind it. Loosening the chains stimulates the weapon's digestive juices which, if not quenched, can have caustic consequences for its wielder.

Mimic Unleashed: As a bonus action while holding the hammer, you can loosen the chains restraining the mimic, leaving it free to mercilessly maul your foes. While the chains are loose, the hammer bites targets that it hits, dealing an extra 1d4 piercing damage.
	If you end your turn holding the hammer while the chains are loose, and you didn't hit a creature with an attack using the hammer that turn, the hammer's excess digestive juices pour down the handle and you take 1d4 acid damage. The chains tighten on their own if the hammer isn't held for 1 minute or if you use a bonus action to tighten the chains while holding the weapon.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Proficiency: simple, light hammer

    <text>Burning with ravenous hunger and unquenchable hanger, this mimic-infused weapon struggles relentlessly against the sturdy iron chains that bind it. Loosening the chains stimulates the weapon's digestive juices which, if not quenched, can have caustic consequences for its wielder.

Mimic Unleashed: As a bonus action while holding the hammer, you can loosen the chains restraining the mimic, leaving it free to mercilessly maul your foes. While the chains are loose, the hammer bites targets that it hits, dealing an extra 1d4 piercing damage.

    <text>Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows.

Fashioned from the claws and shard-scales of a magnetite dragon, this protective armor can become temporarily weightless when exposed to extreme cold. The wearer of this armor can exert minor control over ferrous metals within a close proximity. While you wear this armor, you have resistance to cold damage
	This armor has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn.

Arcanomagnetic Repulsion: You can expend 1 charge to create one of the following effects while you wear this armor.

	â€¢ Repulse: When you are targeted by a weapon attack using a ferrous weapon or ammunition, you can use your reaction to cause a pulse of arcanomagnetism to throw the weapon or ammunition off course, imposing disadvantage on the attack roll.

	â€¢ Aura: As a bonus action, you can create an arcanomagnetic aura with a 30-foot radius centered on you that moves with you and that lasts until the start of your next turn. This area is difficult terrain for creatures of your choice that are made of ferrous metal or wearing ferrous armor.

Superconductor: Whenever you take cold damage while you wear this armor, you gain a flying speed of 30 feet until the end of your next turn.

Barding is armor designed to protect an animal's head, neck, chest, and body.

Chain barding provides a mount with an AC of 16, and reduces the mount's speed by 10 feet unless its Strength score is 13 or better. The mount makes Dexterity (Stealth) checks with disadvantage.

    <text>This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it's usually worn only by those who can't afford better armor.

Fashioned from the claws and shard-scales of a magnetite dragon, this protective armor can become temporarily weightless when exposed to extreme cold. The wearer of this armor can exert minor control over ferrous metals within a close proximity. While you wear this armor, you have resistance to cold damage
	This armor has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn.

Arcanomagnetic Repulsion: You can expend 1 charge to create one of the following effects while you wear this armor.

	â€¢ Repulse: When you are targeted by a weapon attack using a ferrous weapon or ammunition, you can use your reaction to cause a pulse of arcanomagnetism to throw the weapon or ammunition off course, imposing disadvantage on the attack roll.

	â€¢ Aura: As a bonus action, you can create an arcanomagnetic aura with a 40-foot radius centered on you that moves with you and that lasts until the start of your next turn. This area is difficult terrain for creatures of your choice that are made of ferrous metal or wearing ferrous armor.

Superconductor: Whenever you take cold damage while you wear this armor, you gain a flying speed of 40 feet until the end of your next turn.

Swordstorm: As an action, you can cast the blade barrier spell (save DC 17), adding any ferrous objects in the vicinity to the barrier. At the GM's discretion, if there are many ferrous objects in the area, increase the barrier's damage by 2d10. Once you activate this property, you can't do so again until the following dawn.

The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (Dexterity) checks.

    <text>This weapon is naturally attracted to foes bearing ferrous metals, allowing it to strike them with more force. Those who align themselves more closely with the weapon are granted the ability to manipulate gravity, telekinetically pulling creatures and objects into range of its jagged-faced swings.
	You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon against targets made of ferrous metal or wearing ferrous armor.

Optional Attunement: If you choose to attune to this weapon, it gains the Attraction property. When you activate a property granted by this optional attunement, roll a d4. On a 1, haemstrike's optional attunement properties can't be activated until the next dawn.

OA: Attraction: As a bonus action, you can point haemstrike at a target you can see within 30 feet of you. If the target is an object that weighs less than 300 pounds, the object is pulled up to 15 feet towards you. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 15 feet straight towards you. If the creature is made of ferrous metal or is wearing ferrous armor, it has disadvantage on the saving throw. Large or larger creatures automatically succeed on this saving throw.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers.

    <text>This weapon is naturally attracted to foes bearing ferrous metals, allowing it to strike them with more force. Those who align themselves more closely with the weapon are granted the ability to manipulate gravity, telekinetically pulling creatures and objects into range of its jagged-faced swings.
	You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon against targets made of ferrous metal or wearing ferrous armor.

OA: Attraction: As a bonus action, you can point haemstrike at a target you can see within 30 feet of you. If the target is an object that weighs less than 300 pounds, the object is pulled up to 15 feet towards you. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 15 feet straight towards you. If the creature is made of ferrous metal or is wearing ferrous armor, it has disadvantage on the saving throw. Large or larger creatures automatically succeed on this saving throw.

Those who align themselves more closely with the weapon are granted the ability to manipulate gravity, telekinetically pulling creatures and objects into range of its jagged-faced swings.
	The weapon has a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. If the target is made of ferrous metal or is wearing ferrous armor, increase the bonus to +3.

Optional Attunement: If you choose to attune to this weapon, it gains the Attraction property. When you activate a property granted by this optional attunement, roll a d4. On a 1, haemstrike's optional attunement properties can't be activated until the next dawn.

OA: Attraction: As a bonus action, you can point haemstrike at a target you can see within 30 feet of you. If the target is an object that weighs less than 600 pounds, the object is pulled up to 15 feet towards you. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 15 feet straight towards you. If the creature is made of ferrous metal or is wearing ferrous armor, it has disadvantage on the saving throw. Huge or larger creatures automatically succeed on this saving throw.

OA: Magnetic Shockwave: Once per turn when you hit a target with haemstrike, you can cause an eruption of supercooled magnetite shards. Each creature other than you within 5 feet of the target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d6 cold damage and 1d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. Creatures made of ferrous metal or wearing ferrous armor have disadvantage on this saving throw.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Painblind Spores: As a bonus action while holding this axe, you can inhale its spores, numbing your extremities and stimulating muscle recruitment. Until the start of your next turn, melee weapon attacks you make with this weapon have a +2 bonus to damage rolls and you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
	If you use your bonus action to inhale more spores at the beginning of your next turn, the effects continue without interruption. You can prolong the effects in this manner for up to 1 minute, after which the effects end. When the effects end, you become poisoned for a number of minutes equal to ten times the number of rounds you were under the influence of the spores. Once you have benefitted from the Painblind Spores, you can't benefit from them again until after you finish a long rest.

    <text>Used as a magical focus of the more humanoid-esque, 'customer-facing' hyphan colonists, sporespreaders are enchanted to facilitate the calming and assimilation of would-be interlopers. The magic in these foci can poison foes with infectious spores or generate obscuring thick black clouds to allow their wielders to flee dangerous situations.
	This focus has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the sporespreader, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: calm emotions (2 charges) and charm person (1 charge).
	You can also cast the spore cloud* and smokescreen* cantrips from the focus without using any charges.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>Used as a magical focus of the more humanoid-esque, 'customer-facing' hyphan colonists, sporespreaders are enchanted to facilitate the calming and assimilation of would-be interlopers. The magic in these foci can poison foes with infectious spores or generate obscuring thick black clouds to allow their wielders to flee dangerous situations.
	This focus has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the sporespreader, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: calm emotions (2 charges) and charm person (1 charge).
	You can also cast the spore cloud* and smokescreen* cantrips from the focus without using any charges.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Arcane Focus: An arcane focus is a special item designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus.

    <text>Never has the saying "smash something into next week" been so apt. With an hourglass filled with brilliant platinum sand, this magical impact weapon utilises the dreamholder's command over time dilation to throw its victims forward in time.
	This weapon has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

Chronal Blink: As a bonus action, you can twist the weapon's pommel, expending 1 charge and causing the sand to begin churning in defiance of gravity. The next creature you hit with an attack using this weapon within the next minute must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target disappears as it gets shunted forwards in time, reappearing in the space from which it disappeared, or the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied, at the end of your next turn.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Chronal Blink: As a bonus action, you can twist the weapon's pommel, expending 1 charge and causing the sand to begin churning in defiance of gravity. The next creature you hit with an attack using this weapon within the next minute must make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target disappears as it gets shunted forwards in time, reappearing in the space from which it disappeared, or the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied, at the end of your next turn.

Detachable Eye: As an action, you can detach the eye from the centre of the weapon's shaft, placing it on a surface to which it adheres for the next hour. The eye relays a constant stream of visual information to the larger eye on the weapon, which transforms to become a screen through which you can view what the smaller eye can see. At the end of the hour, the smaller eye teleports back to the weapon. Once you use this property, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Harnessing the time dilative power of the dreamholder, this magic weapon lets its wielder swing back in time, or speed the flow of time for itself, allowing it to act more quickly.
	This magic weapon has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.

Pause: As a bonus action, you can flip the axe around anti-clockwise in your hands, expending 1 charge. Until the end of your next turn, any creature or object that moves leaves a ghostly image of itself at the moment you activated this property. You can target this ghostly image with attacks, spells, and effects as if the creature were still in that space, though the effects appear on the target wherever it is now.

Time Dilation: As a bonus action, you can tap into this weapon's chronomantic magic, casting the haste spell on yourself (no concentration required). When you do so, the GM rolls 1d3; the result (which the GM keeps secret) is how many rounds the spell lasts (ending at the end of your turn). After you activate this property, you can't do so again until the next dawn.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

After you activate this property, you can't do so again until the next dawn.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

    <text>The time splitter is just the tool for an almighty adventurer who's always a little too slow to get where they need to be exactly in the nick of time. Harnessing the time dilative power of the dreamholder, this magic weapon lets its wielder swing back in time, or speed the flow of time for itself, allowing it to act more quickly.
	This magic weapon has 9 charges and regains 1d6 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn.

Pause: As a bonus action, you can flip the axe around anti-clockwise in your hands, expending 1 charge. Until the end of your next turn, any creature or object that moves leaves a ghostly image of itself at the moment you activated this property. You can target this ghostly image with attacks, spells, and effects as if the creature were still in that space, though the effects appear on the target wherever it is now.

After you activate this property, you can't do so again until the next dawn.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Proficiency: simple, handaxe

    <text>The blade of this wicked khopesh is composed of several individual sections linked by a sturdy chain running through the weapon's length. Always dry to the touch, this magical blade appears to continuously absorb any water with which it comes into contact.

Split at the Seams: As a bonus action, you can press a button hidden on the weapon's hilt to cause the sections comprising the blade to magically detach from one another, remaining connected by the chain. Until reformed as a sword as a bonus action, this weapon loses its former sword properties and gains those of a whip.

Unquenchable Thirst: When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, it releases a deadly burst of desiccating, negative energy that drains moisture from a target, forcing it to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 6d6 necrotic damage and is desiccated for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't desiccated. A desiccated creature's skin turns dry and brittle, rupturing with ease, and causing the creature to take an additional 1d4 slashing damage whenever it takes bludgeoning, force, piercing, slashing, or thunder damage. A desiccated creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property has no effect on creatures without skin or on those immune to necrotic damage.

With a lengthy reload time and complete lack of accuracy, this matchlock-augmented polearm is usable at only one range: point blank. It also comes with a lovely ribbon and a neat basket to hold all your spare shot. Cute.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Point Blank Shot: When you hit a target with an attack using a loaded gunnspier, you can use a bonus action to pull the trigger, firing a plum-sized leaden ball at the target. The attack deals an additional 2d8 bludgeoning damage. As an action, you can reload the gunnspier.

Backfire: When you use Point Blank Shot and roll an 8 on both of the additional bludgeoning damage dice, the gunnspier backfires. Each creature within 10 feet of you (including you) must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 piercing damage as shrapnel erupts from the weapon.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

    <text>"Stab, bang, hope." If consulted, these are the instructions any kobold will give on using a gunnspier. With a lengthy reload time and complete lack of accuracy, this matchlock-augmented polearm is usable at only one range: point blank. It also comes with a lovely ribbon and a neat basket to hold all your spare shot. Cute.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Point Blank Shot: When you hit a target with an attack using a loaded gunnspier, you can use a bonus action to pull the trigger, firing a plum-sized leaden ball at the target. The attack deals an additional 2d8 bludgeoning damage. As an action, you can reload the gunnspier.

Backfire: When you use Point Blank Shot and roll an 8 on both of the additional bludgeoning damage dice, the gunnspier backfires. Each creature within 10 feet of you (including you) must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 piercing damage as shrapnel erupts from the weapon.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Backfire: When you roll an 8 on Tetanus Blade's poison damage, dormant pathogens within surrounding creatures become reinvigorated.

Pneumatic Strike: After you make an attack roll with this weapon, but before the result of the attack is determined, you can use a bonus action to pull the blade's trigger. With a pneumatic thrust, the top of the weapon arcs forward and you gain a +5 bonus to the attack roll.

Heated Weapon: When you hit a creature with an attack that uses Pneumatic Strike, the pathogens that live within the rusty blade are reinvigorated by its magic, and the attack deals an additional 2d8 fire damage.

Burnout: When you use the Heated Weapon property of this weapon and roll an 8 on both of the additional fire damage dice, the heating mechanism backfires. Each creature within 10 feet of you (including you) must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 fire damage as scalding pneumatic fluid bursts out.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>Forged as a pair, these magic weapons are crafted from the matching upper and lower jaw bones of a tarrasque. Their innate magicâ€”and one of the reasons the tar-rasque's bite is so powerfulâ€”creates an arcanomagnetic pull between the two jawbones, dealing devastating damage to whatever lies between them.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with each of these magic weapons. These weapons deal piercing damage instead of their usual damage type.

Chomp: When you engage in two-weapon fighting using these two weapons and hit the same target with both weapons, the attack you make with your second weapon deals an additional 1d8 damage.

Optional Attunement: You can choose to attune to a pair of jaw breakers. They count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to. When you do so, the weapons gain the Swirling Dervish property while you are attuned to them.

OA: Swirling Dervish: Harnessing the power of the blades, you leap over a target, becoming a tornado of lacerating blades. As an action while you wield both jaw breakers, you can perform a magically-enhanced jump, attacking creatures you pass over. This jump has a maximum distance of 20 feet, is a straight line, must end in an unoccupied space, does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and each foot you clear on the jump costs one foot of movement. You can make one attack against a creature under you in each 5-foot space over which you jump. These attacks always alternate main-hand, then off-hand.
	For example, if you jumped over one Huge creature, you could make three attacks against it (the second one dealing Chomp's extra damage on a hit). If you jumped over three Medium creatures, you could make one attack against each (with no extra damage from Chomp).

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

This jump has a maximum distance of 20 feet, is a straight line, must end in an unoccupied space, does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and each foot you clear on the jump costs one foot of movement. You can make one attack against a creature under you in each 5-foot space over which you jump. These attacks always alternate main-hand, then off-hand.
	For example, if you jumped over one Huge creature, you could make three attacks against it (the second one dealing Chomp's extra damage on a hit). If you jumped over three Medium creatures, you could make one attack against each (with no extra damage from Chomp).

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

    <text>Forged as a pair, these magic weapons are crafted from the matching upper and lower jaw bones of a tarrasque. Their innate magicâ€”and one of the reasons the tar-rasque's bite is so powerfulâ€”creates an arcanomagnetic pull between the two jawbones, dealing devastating damage to whatever lies between them.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with each of these magic weapons. These weapons deal piercing damage instead of their usual damage type.

Chomp: When you engage in two-weapon fighting using these two weapons and hit the same target with both weapons, the attack you make with your second weapon deals an additional 1d8 damage.

Optional Attunement: You can choose to attune to a pair of jaw breakers. They count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to. When you do so, the weapons gain the Swirling Dervish property while you are attuned to them.

Optional Attunement: You can choose to attune to a pair of jaw breakers. They count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to. When you do so, the weapons gain the Swirling Dervish property while you are attuned to them.

OA: Swirling Dervish: Harnessing the power of the blades, you leap over a target, becoming a tornado of lacerating blades. As an action while you wield both jaw breakers, you can perform a magically-enhanced jump, attacking creatures you pass over. This jump has a maximum distance of 20 feet, is a straight line, must end in an unoccupied space, does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and each foot you clear on the jump costs one foot of movement. You can make one attack against a creature under you in each 5-foot space over which you jump. These attacks always alternate main-hand, then off-hand.
	For example, if you jumped over one Huge creature, you could make three attacks against it (the second one dealing Chomp's extra damage on a hit). If you jumped over three Medium creatures, you could make one attack against each (with no extra damage from Chomp).

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

    <text>Forged as a pair, these magic weapons are crafted from the matching upper and lower jaw bones of a tarrasque. Their innate magicâ€”and one of the reasons the tar-rasque's bite is so powerfulâ€”creates an arcanomagnetic pull between the two jawbones, dealing devastating damage to whatever lies between them.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Their innate magicâ€”and one of the reasons the tar-rasque's bite is so powerfulâ€”creates an arcanomagnetic pull between the two jawbones, dealing devastating damage to whatever lies between them.
	You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with each of these magic weapons. These weapons deal piercing damage instead of their usual damage type.

Chomp: When you engage in two-weapon fighting using these two weapons and hit the same target with both weapons, the attack you make with your second weapon deals an additional 1d8 damage.

Optional Attunement: You can choose to attune to a pair of jaw breakers. They count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to. When you do so, the weapons gain the Swirling Dervish property while you are attuned to them.

OA: Swirling Dervish: Harnessing the power of the blades, you leap over a target, becoming a tornado of lacerating blades. As an action while you wield both jaw breakers, you can perform a magically-enhanced jump, attacking creatures you pass over. This jump has a maximum distance of 25 feet, is a straight line, must end in an unoccupied space, does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and each foot you clear on the jump costs one foot of movement. You can make one attack against a creature under you in each 5-foot space over which you jump. These attacks always alternate main-hand, then off-hand.
	For example, if you jumped over one Huge creature, you could make three attacks against it (the second one dealing Chomp's extra damage on a hit). If you jumped over three Medium creatures, you could make one attack against each (with no extra damage from Chomp).

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

	For example, if you jumped over one Huge creature, you could make three attacks against it (the second one dealing Chomp's extra damage on a hit). If you jumped over three Medium creatures, you could make one attack against each (with no extra damage from Chomp).

    <text>Forged as a pair, these magic weapons are crafted from the matching upper and lower jaw bones of a tarrasque. Their innate magicâ€”and one of the reasons the tar-rasque's bite is so powerfulâ€”creates an arcanomagnetic pull between the two jawbones, dealing devastating damage to whatever lies between them.
	You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with each of these magic weapons. These weapons deal piercing damage instead of their usual damage type.

Chomp: When you engage in two-weapon fighting using these two weapons and hit the same target with both weapons, the attack you make with your second weapon deals an additional 1d8 damage.

Optional Attunement: You can choose to attune to a pair of jaw breakers. They count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to. When you do so, the weapons gain the Swirling Dervish property while you are attuned to them.

OA: Swirling Dervish: Harnessing the power of the blades, you leap over a target, becoming a tornado of lacerating blades. As an action while you wield both jaw breakers, you can perform a magically-enhanced jump, attacking creatures you pass over. This jump has a maximum distance of 25 feet, is a straight line, must end in an unoccupied space, does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and each foot you clear on the jump costs one foot of movement. You can make one attack against a creature under you in each 5-foot space over which you jump. These attacks always alternate main-hand, then off-hand.
	For example, if you jumped over one Huge creature, you could make three attacks against it (the second one dealing Chomp's extra damage on a hit). If you jumped over three Medium creatures, you could make one attack against each (with no extra damage from Chomp).

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

    <text>From the fossilised teeth of a tar-rasque is extracted the magic of rage and ferocity. Upon attuning to this weapon, you gain the ability to unleash terrifyingly monstrous roars and swing the enormous, bone-handled blade with astounding aggression.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with this magic weapon. This weapon has 5 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 charges daily at dawn.

Ferocious Blow: As an action, you can expend 1 charge to call upon the spirit of the tar-rasque and make a mighty swing with this weapon. If the attack hits, roll four times as many damage dice for the weapon as normal for this attack. This dice multiplication does not affect additional damage from abilities such as smite or sneak attack, and is unaffected by critical hits. If the attack misses, you fall prone and your speed is reduced to 0 feet until the start of your next turn.

Terrorise: As a bonus action, or as part of the bonus action you use to activate the Rage class feature, you can brandish the terrorasque, amplifying your yell with that of a tar-rasque's. Each hostile creature within 60 feet of you that can hear you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you for 1 minute. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect for itself on a success. After you use this property, you can't do so again for 1 hour.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Each hostile creature within 60 feet of you that can hear you must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you for 1 minute. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect for itself on a success. After you use this property, you can't do so again for 1 hour.

Tar Strike: As an action, you can mentally command this weapon to ooze tar, expending 1 charge as you make one attack against a creature with it. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack's normal effects and is restrained for 1 minute. The creature can use its action to make a DC 16 Strength check, ending the restrained condition on a success.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.
