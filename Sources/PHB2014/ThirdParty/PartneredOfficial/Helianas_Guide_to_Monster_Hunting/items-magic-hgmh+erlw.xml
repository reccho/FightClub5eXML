    <text>A claw is a simple, bladed melee weapon worn as a glove.

An armblade is a magic weapon that attaches to your arm, becoming inseparable from you as long as you're attuned to it. To attune to this item, you must hold it against your forearm for the entire attunement period.
	As a bonus action, you can retract the armblade into your forearm or extend it from there. While it is extended, you can use the weapon as if you were holding it, and you can't use that hand for other purposes.

Special: Attached. You can't be disarmed of this weapon, but donning or doffing the weapon takes an action. You can use a hand equipped with a claw to hold items, but can't attack with the claw while doing so. Additionally, you have disadvantage on attack rolls using other weapons held in your clawed hand.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Proficiency: simple, claw

	As a bonus action, you can retract the armblade into your forearm or extend it from there. While it is extended, you can use the weapon as if you were holding it, and you can't use that hand for other purposes.

Special: Whirl. When you are wielding the haladie in two hands, you can use a bonus action to attempt to whirl the weapon. To whirl, make a DC 10 Dexterity check, adding your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with haladie. On a success, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn, the whirling blades acting as a barrier against attacks. On a result of 15 or higher, you gain a +2 bonus, instead. On a failure, you deal slashing damage to yourself equal to your proficiency bonus and gain no bonus to your AC from the whirl this turn.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

An armblade is a magic weapon that attaches to your arm, becoming inseparable from you as long as you're attuned to it. To attune to this item, you must hold it against your forearm for the entire attunement period.
	As a bonus action, you can retract the armblade into your forearm or extend it from there. While it is extended, you can use the weapon as if you were holding it, and you can't use that hand for other purposes.

Special: Hookpull. As a bonus action immediately after you hit a target no more than one size larger than you with an attack using the tetherhook, you can attempt to hook the target using the tetherhook's reach. Make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, the target is hooked and can't move further away from you. A hooked creature is no longer hooked if you release the tether with both hands, but only one hand is required to keep a creature hooked. A hooked creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics)
check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.
	As part of the bonus action to hook the target, and as a bonus action on any of your subsequent turns while it remains hooked, you can pull the creature 5 feet closer to you. If the target is an object that isn't fixed in place and that weighs less than your push, drag, or lift capacity, you can pull it 5 feet closer to you as a bonus action after you hit it with an attack.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

    <text>Nunchucks are martial melee weapons composed of two hard batons connected to one another by a short chain.

You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

An armblade is a magic weapon that attaches to your arm, becoming inseparable from you as long as you're attuned to it. To attune to this item, you must hold it against your forearm for the entire attunement period.
	As a bonus action, you can retract the armblade into your forearm or extend it from there. While it is extended, you can use the weapon as if you were holding it, and you can't use that hand for other purposes.

Special: Flourish. When you are wielding the nunchucks in two hands and take the Attack action on your turn, you can attempt to flourish with the weapon immediately before you make your first attack. To flourish, make a DC 13 Dexterity check, adding your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with nunchucks. On a success, you gain a +2 bonus to the first attack roll you make this turn. On a failure, you deal bludgeoning damage to yourself equal to your proficiency bonus and gain no bonus from your flourishes this turn.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>A tetherhook is a hook attached to a chain or strap.

You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

An armblade is a magic weapon that attaches to your arm, becoming inseparable from you as long as you're attuned to it. To attune to this item, you must hold it against your forearm for the entire attunement period.
	As a bonus action, you can retract the armblade into your forearm or extend it from there. While it is extended, you can use the weapon as if you were holding it, and you can't use that hand for other purposes.

Special: Hookpull. As a bonus action immediately after you hit a target no more than one size larger than you with an attack using the tetherhook, you can attempt to hook the target using the tetherhook's reach. Make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, the target is hooked and can't move further away from you. A hooked creature is no longer hooked if you release the tether with both hands, but only one hand is required to keep a creature hooked. A hooked creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics)
check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.
	As part of the bonus action to hook the target, and as a bonus action on any of your subsequent turns while it remains hooked, you can pull the creature 5 feet closer to you. If the target is an object that isn't fixed in place and that weighs less than your push, drag, or lift capacity, you can pull it 5 feet closer to you as a bonus action after you hit it with an attack.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.
