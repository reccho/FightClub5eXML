    <trait>
      <name>Tamer</name>
      <text>Flourishing a gilded skull snatched from within the folds of a cloak, a dwarf summons a fierce-eyed angel in a flare of blinding radiance, emphatically encouraging it to fantastical feats of fury.
	Beaming from ear to ear, a chemical-stained gnome admires her handiwork amongst the clutter of her laboratory: a 'snektopus'; eight venom-fanged maws perfectly spliced with the intelligence of a cephalopod.
	Coughing in the smoking ruins of the cultists' former hideout, a tiefling gives their fire-infused owlbear a playful rub behind the ears, contemplating a job well done and the rewards to be claimed.
	Whether imbuing their companions with the primordial elements, enhancing them through the 'very tiny stitches' of biomancy, or inciting them with words of encouragement, tamers work through their captured friends. Alone, a tamer possesses little in the way of destructive ability. With carefully selected companions, a tamer can become an unstoppable menagerie of mayhem.

    <trait>
      <name>Creating a Tamer</name>
      <text>What prompted you to begin taming creatures? Loneliness? A need to transport your favourite dragonling through customs? A pathological desire to catch 'em all?
	The bond tamers experience with their companions are incredibly intimate; both are privy to the other's innermost thoughts. However, such bondsdiffer between tamers: where one tamer might view a companion as friend and equal, another might view the creature as a tool with which to fulfill their own goals. Have you lost a companion before? How did you react? Perhaps it was emotionally traumatising, or perhaps it was simply a mere inconvenience.

Quick Build:
You can make a tamer by following this suggestion: Choose Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma to be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution.</text>

        <name>Multiclass Tamer</name>
        <text>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player's Handbook, here's what you need to know if you choose tamer as one of your classes.

Ability Score Minimum:
As a multiclass character, you must have at least the following ability score(s) to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a tamer.

	• Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma 13

Proficiencies Gained:
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of your new class's starting proficiencies, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a tamer.

	• Armor: light armor, shields
	• Weapons: simple weapons, nets

      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Multiclass Features</name>
        <text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does).
	Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared:
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.
	Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
	If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots:
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
	If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.
	For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic:
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

      <feature>
        <name>Pocket Familiar</name>
        <text>You become bonded to a companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. Choose a Small or smaller creature with a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower that isn't a humanoid, giant, or swarm to become your companion. When a creature becomes your companion, it has a maximum number of hit points equal to the average of its Hit Dice, as indicated in its statistics, and it can't cast spells. Work with your GM to find a companion that suits your campaign world. This companion obeys your commands and is friendly to you and your allies.

Vessel. When not summoned, your companion exists inside a magical vessel of your own design, such as a painted animal skull, bejewelled egg, or crystal sphere. While in this vessel, the companion has full cover from all attacks and other effects, is unaffected by area of effects that originate from outside the vessel, and exists in stasis; it doesn't need to eat, drink, sleep, or breathe, and it is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralised. A companion at 0 hit points is instantly stabilised when it enters its vessel.
	If a vessel is broken, or a companion is released from its vessel for any other reason, the creature within it ceases to be a tamer's companion. It acts according to its own wishes and retains any improvements it gained while a companion.

Summoning. As an action, you can summon your companion from a vessel, causing it to appear in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you, or any unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. You can dismiss a companion within 30 feet of you as a bonus action or action, drawing it back into its vessel. To summon or dismiss a companion, you must be holding its vessel in hand. You can only have one companion summoned at a time.

Combat. In combat, your companion shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action or action on your turn to command it to take different actions. Those actions can be in its statistics or some other action, bonus action, or object interaction. If you are incapacitated, the companion can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge. Your companion can't take the Multiattack action until you reach 5th level in this class, even if it would otherwise be able to.

Rest. A companion gains the benefits of a long rest when its tamer finish a long rest; if it has at least 1 hit point, it regains all its hit points when you finish a long rest. Unlike other creatures, a companion can't spend its own Hit Dice to recover hit points at the end of a short rest. See the Soul Bond feature for details on recovering hit points.

Items. Armor, barding, and weapons can be equipped to enhance your companion. A companion can wear or carry any equipment that their size and body shape permits. However, your companion must be proficient with the armor or weapon to make full use of it. If your companion wears armor that it lacks proficiency with, it has disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves

Strength or Dexterity. A companion that is not proficient with a weapon type does not add its proficiency bonus to attack rolls made with that weapon type.

Item Bonding. Over the course of an hour, you can bond a companion to one object that it can wear or carry that is not any sort of container or storage. When a companion is recalled, all items it is wearing or carrying that it is not bonded to are dropped in the space from which it was recalled. A companion can be bonded to up to 3 items at any one time. Companions can't attune to magic items, unless they have a specific ability that allows them to do so (e.g. Proto-Attunement).

Companion Barding. You can purchase armor for your companion. Any type of armor can be purchased as barding. The cost and weight is doubled for each size category above Medium, and halved for each size category below Small. In addition, the cost is further doubled if the companion is not humanoid in shape.

Companion Barding Cost:
Size | Humanoid Shape Cost | Abstract Shape Cost
Tiny | 0.5x | 1x
Small | 1x | 2x
Medium | 1x | 2x
Large | 2x | 4x
Huge | 4x | 8x

        <text>Companions make death saving throws, die, and can be revived like any player character. A companion that has been stabilised remains unconscious until it regains hit points, or until you finish a long rest. Companions that are stable and have 0 hit points when you finish a long rest regain half their maximum hit points.
	You have a pool of healing power equal to five times your tamer level that replenishes when you finish a long rest. Whenever you finish a short rest, you can choose to draw power from that pool, restoring a total number of hit points amongst your companions up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.

        <name>Monster Trainer</name>
        <text>As you gain levels in this class, your companions become more powerful. Your companions use your proficiency bonus instead of their own, potentially increasing their attack, saving throw, and skill modifiers, and their saving throw DCs.

Training. Whenever you gain an Ability Score Improvement from gaining a level in the tamer class, you pass on your hardened resolve to all your companions, causing them to gain one additional Hit Die. Increase your companion's hit point maximum by rolling this Hit Die and adding your companion's Constitution modifier (minimum of 0).
	Whenever you gain a level beyond 1st in this class, each companion to which you are bonded gains one of the following improvements. The familiars in Chapter 8 have unique improvements that can be taken instead of these.
	Any newly gained companions receive these additional Hit Dice and improvements as if you had them since your 1st level in tamer.

Companion Improvement Training Table:
Improvement | Effect
Speed Training | Increase one existing speed by 15 feet up to a maximum of 150% of the creature's base speed, rounded up to the nearest 5-foot increment*.
Toughen Up | Your companion gains an additional Hit Die, increasing its hit point maximum. Increase your companion's hit point maximum by rolling this Hit Die and adding your companion's Constitution modifier (minimum of 0).
Ability Boost | Increase one of your companion's ability scores by 1, to a maximum of 20.
Go For the Throat | Your companion gains a +1 bonus to its attack and damage rolls made with its natural weapons or unarmed strikes**.
Survival Instincts | Your companion gains proficiency in one saving throw.
War Training | Your companion gains proficiency with one armor type or two weapons***.

*E.g., a base speed of 30 feet can be increased to 45 feet maximum, a base speed of 25 feet can be increased to 40 feet, and a base speed of 20 feet to 30 feet.

**Your companions can each benefit from this feature once. When you reach 5th level in this class, your companions can each benefit from this feature twice. When you reach 9th level in this class, your companions can each benefit from this feature three times. This improvement does not affect attacks made with weapons.

***Your companion can't gain proficiency in medium and heavy armor until it has gained proficiency in the prerequisite lighter armor types. For example, to gain proficiency in heavy armor, you must take this improvement 3 times: light, then medium, then heavy. Work with your GM to figure out if and how a creature can wield shields and weapons.

        <name>Tame Creature</name>
        <text>One way to defeat deadly foes: have deadlier friends. As you explore, you will encounter new creatures which you may wish to make your companions. You can tame a Small or smaller creature of CR ½ or lower, as described below. As you gain levels in this class, the size and challenge rating of creatures you can tame increases, as shown in the Tamer Companion Summary table.

Vessel. To tame a companion, you must first prepare a vessel using special inks, gems, or other materials. Preparing the vessel takes 8 hours of work and components with a value in gold pieces equal to at least one hundred times the target creature's CR.

Taming a Creature:
As an action, you can throw an empty vessel at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your tamer spell save DC or be trapped within the vessel. A creature automatically succeeds on this saving throw if:

	• It is a humanoid, giant, or swarm.
	• It is larger than your maximum companion size (use a creature's unaltered size if it is under the influence of a size-changing magical effect, such as enlarge/reduce).
	• It has a higher CR than your maximum companion CR (see the Tamer Companion Summary table).
	• It has a higher CR than the vessel can capture.
	• It has more than half of its hit points.

If a creature doesn't automatically succeed on this saving throw for one of the above reasons, and has either fewer than ten hit points or one-quarter of its hit points, it automatically fails this saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw is trapped in your vessel and becomes your companion when you next finish a long rest.

Lost Traits. When a creature becomes your companion, it loses the following from its stat block:

	• The ability to cast any spells (though it retains its spells known, see Psychic Bond, page 711).
	• Any summoning actions or actions that create additional creatures (such as a wraith's Create Specter action or an ooze's Split reaction).
	• The Regeneration, Rejuvenation, and Legendary Resistance traits.
	• Any legendary actions and legendary action options.

        <name>Spellcasting</name>
        <text>By 2nd level, you have learned to harness your mental fortitude to augment the potential of others. You can cast tamer spells.

Cantrips:
At 2nd level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the tamer spell list. You learn additional tamer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Tamer table.

Spell Slots:
The Tamer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your tamer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these tamer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the tamer spell list.
	The Spells Known column of the Tamer table shows when you learn more tamer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the tamer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the tamer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability:
When you gain your first level in this class, choose whether you use your knowledge (Intelligence), willpower (Wisdom), or force of personality (Charisma) as your spellcasting ability for your tamer spells. You use this spellcasting ability whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your spellcasting ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tamer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier

Spellcasting Focus:
You can use a creature's vessel as a spellcasting focus for your tamer spells.

During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.

Spell Swap. While your companion is summoned, is within 100 feet of you, and you hold its vessel, any spells your companion knows are added to your known spells. In addition, when you cast a spell with a range of self or touch, your companion can be the target of that spell.

At the start of each of the target creature's turns for the next minute, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw versus your tamer spell save DC if it is within 30 feet of your companion and can see your companion. On a failure, it suffers the effects of the associated behaviour until the start of its next turn. On a success, it is unaffected.

	• Aggressive. The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls it makes against creatures other than your companion.

	• Acid: Caustic Mist. Your companion disperses an acidic vapour into a 20-foot cube originating from it that lasts for 1 minute, or until dispersed by a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour). Each other creature that starts its turn in the area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 4d4 acid damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success.

	• Cold: Snap Freeze. Your companion absorbs the heat in a 10-foot-radius sphere around it. Each other creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 cold damage and its speed is halved until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and its speed isn't affected.

	• Fire: Flametongue. Your companion unleashes a raging inferno in a 25-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 fire damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

	• Lightning: Sparkstep. Your companion discharges lightning in a 10-foot-radius sphere centred on itself. Each other creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 4d6 lightning damage and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn. On a success, it takes half as much damage and can take reactions as normal. After the saving throws are resolved, your companion can immediately fly up to 30 feet as part of this action.

Once a companion uses one of these actions, it can't use any action granted by this feature again until you finish a short or long rest. Starting at 18th level, a companion can use this action twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.

        <name>Enervate (Necromancer)</name>
        <text>You learn to channel life force between you and your companions. As an action while your summoned companion is within 100 feet of you, you can deal necrotic damage to your companion up to a value equal to twice your tamer level. This damage can't be reduced in any way. You then regain hit points equal to the damage dealt. Alternatively, you can deal the necrotic damage to yourself and restore hit points to your summoned companion equal to the damage you took.

        <name>Aura of Undeath (Necromancer)</name>
        <text>As an action, you tap into deep pools of necromantic energy, imbuing your companion with a 15-foot aura of undeath for the next minute. While imbued with this aura, your companion can, as a bonus action on its turn, force one creature it can see within the aura to make a Constitution saving throw against your tamer spell save DC. On a failure, the creature takes 4d8 necrotic damage and your companion gains a number of temporary hit points equal to half the damage dealt.
	In addition, for the duration, when your companion would be reduced to 0 hit points, it doesn't fall unconscious. Instead, it is reduced to 1 hit point and gains one failed death saving throw. If your companion gains three failed death saving throws during the minute, or five failed death saving throws if it has the undead type, it immediately dies. At the end of the minute, your companion drops to 0 hit points, falls unconscious, and is stable.
	Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

    <!-- Training Paradigm: Splicer -->

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Training Paradigm: Splicer</name>
        <text>You can fiddle with the very essence of your companions, crafting minor improvements and modifications. When you choose this paradigm, you gain 3 splicer points. Each time you gain a level in the tamer class, you gain 1 additional splicer point. You can spend these points to modify your companions with the following augments—features and traits that take effect when you next finish a long rest. Splicer points are shared across all your companions. If a companion is ever released, it loses any augments it had and the splicer points are refunded. Augments can be gained only once unless otherwise stated. See the Splicer Augments table below for more details.

Surgeon's Tools. You also gain proficiency with surgeon's tools. You can spend 1 hour removing all augments from one companion with your surgeon's tools, causing it to lose all the associated effects. You regain all splicer points spent on that companion and can re-allocate those points as you see fit.

        <name>Modular Upgrades (Splicer)</name>
        <text>You can upgrade each of your companions with exotic organs and appendages. At the start of a long rest, you can choose one of the following upgrades for each of your companions. At the end of the long rest, the biomantic meld completes, and your companion gains the associated action option. The DC for the saving throw equals your tamer spell save DC.

	• Compelling Plumage. Each creature in a 25- foot cone that can see your companion must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by your companion's dazzling display of colour for the next minute. While charmed in this way, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0 feet. The effect ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage, if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor, if it no longer has line of sight to the companion, or is ever more than 25 feet away from the companion.

	• Phosphoburst. Each other creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centred on your companion must make a Constitution saving throw against the dizzying burst of light your companion emits. On a failure, a creature takes 2d10 radiant damage and is blinded until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't blinded.

	• Poison Web. Your companion launches an unfurling web of sticky silk in a 20-foot cube originating from it. All surfaces in the area become lined with webbing for the next minute. Each creature that touches one of these surfaces for the first time on its turn or starts its turn doing so must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or become restrained for the duration, or until it breaks free. A creature restrained by the webs takes 2d4 poison damage when it becomes restrained and at the start of each of its turns. A creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your tamer spell save DC, freeing itself or another creature restrained by this web on a success.

	• Sirenshriek. Each other creature in a 15-foot-radius sphere centred on your companion must make an Intelligence saving throw as your companion lets forth a brain-curdling mental shriek. On a failure, a creature takes 3d8 psychic damage and, if it is concentrating on a spell, loses its concentration. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and makes saving throws to maintain its concentration as normal.

Once a companion uses one of these actions, it can't do so again until it finishes a short or long rest. Starting at 18th level, a companion can use this action twice before a rest.

        <text>You augment your companions with a highly adaptive mutagen, allowing them to gain the strengths of foes they defeat and confer it to your other companions through a synchronous quantum biomantic link.
	As an action, you can command your companion to consume the corpse of a non-swarm creature that has been dead for less than 1 minute. Choose one of the consumed creature's damage resistances, damage immunities, or condition immunities (except immunity to exhaustion). All of your companions gain resistance to one damage type to which the slain creature was resistant or immune, or gain immunity to one condition to which the creature was immune.
	After you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. When you use this feature again, your companions lose any benefit they had previously gained from this feature.

        <name>Adrenal Overload (Splicer)</name>
        <text>As an action, you trigger a hidden, internal switch within your companion, triggering a cascade of rapid mutations that lasts for the next minute, with the following results:

	• It immediately grows to Huge size (if it isn't already).

	• Its weight increases by a factor of 8 per size category increased.

	• It gains temporary hit points equal to ten times your tamer level.

	• Its Strength score increases to 22 (if it isn't already higher).

	• It gains proficiency in the Athletics skill.

	• It sprouts an appendage with which it can make melee weapon attacks with a reach of 5 feet that deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice when you take the action) equal to 3d6 plus its Strength modifier (+6) on a hit.

	• It gains the Multiattack action option:
The companion makes three attacks with its appendage.

After the minute elapses, your companion falls unconscious for 1d4 hours and gains 2 levels of exhaustion. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
