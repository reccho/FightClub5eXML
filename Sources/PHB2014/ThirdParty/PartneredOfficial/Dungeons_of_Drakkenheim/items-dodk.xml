    <name>Aqua Delerium</name>
    <detail>rare</detail>
    <type>P</type>
    <text>This purple potion glows dimly with octarine light. It swirls and sparkles in its small stoppered bottle.
	When you drink this potion, you regain expended spell slots. Roll 1d6 - you choose spell slots to regain that have a combined level that is equal to or less than the result. None of the slots can be higher than 5th level.
	For one hour after drinking aqua delerium, roll 1d20 each time you cast a spell of 1st level or higher. On a 1, you trigger a random arcane anomaly (see Dungeons of Drakkenheim).
	If you consume more than one dose of aqua delerium before finishing your next long rest, you take (1d12) necrotic damage for each spell level regained, and your hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken until you finish a long rest. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way.
	When a creature who cannot cast spells using spell slots drinks aqua delerium, it takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and gains one level of contamination.

Arcane Anomalies:
1d20 | Arcane Anomalies
1 | Gravity breaks within a 100-foot radius area for 1 hour. Creatures levitate in midair, and must move by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows them to move as if they were climbing. Unattended objects float around randomly.
2 | The nearest creature is affected by a hideous laughter spell (Save DC 15) but instead of laughing, the creature repeats unfathomable combinations of syllables and words.
3 | Time skips a beat. Creatures within 60 feet experience a palpable feeling of vertigo followed by a powerful sensation of deja vu and are stunned for 1 round (No save).
4 | The nearest creature becomes unstuck in time. It is affected by the blink spell for 1 minute. Instead of vanishing into the Ethereal Plane, the creature vanishes into a sliver of time in its past or possible future.
5 | A prismatic burst of energy erupts in a 20-foot radius. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 8d6 radiant damage and become blinded for 1 round. The smell of ozone fills the area, and wood transforms into glass.
6 | Echoes of possible realities are briefly visible for 1 minute. When a creature within 60 feet is hit by an attack, a faint vision of the creature being killed by that attack appears.
7 | Discordant music fills the mind of all creatures within 30 feet, who are affected as if by irresistible dance (Save DC 15).
8 | A section of stone, water, air, or energy becomes an appropriate contaminated elemental.
9 | An extraplanar creature is summoned and remains for 1 hour. The DM either chooses the creature or determines it randomly. It is friendly to the creature who triggered the anomaly.
10 | All humanoid corpses within 120 feet animate as hostile haze husks. The shrieking undead beg frantically for forgiveness as they rip apart the living.
11 | The shadows of 1d6 random creatures in the area animate and try to kill them. Once destroyed, the creatures don't cast a shadow for 24 hours.
12 | All creatures within 60 feet become invisible for 1 min or until they attack or cast a spell.
13 | Tendrils of life flow from the nearest creature to others. It must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 8d8 necrotic damage, half on a success. The three nearest creatures within 60 feet each regain hit points equal to the damage taken.
14 | A hypnotic pattern (save DC 15) appears. It creates scintillating impossible colours in shapes which are simply wrong. Creatures incapacitated by the spell weep uncontrollably.
15 | A black tentacles spell appears in the area for 1 hour (Escape DC 15).
16 | Objects within 60 feet come to life for the next hour, as if affected by the animate objects spell. They mumble awful truths, but are not otherwise hostile.
17 | The nearest creature is polymorphed into an awakened shrub for 1 hour or until reduced to 0 hp (No save).
18 | Time slows down for up to six randomly determined creatures within 120 feet of the anomaly. They are affected by the slow spell for 1 minute. (Save DC 15).
19 | Time speeds up for one randomly determined creature within 60 feet of the anomaly. They are affected by the haste spell for 1 minute.
20 | A bowl of flowers and a very surprised aquatic mammal appear 100 feet in the air. "Oh no, not again..." thinks the flowers.

    <type>P</type>
    <text>This bright orange fluid is stored in a syringe and charged with arcane magic. You can use an action to administer the shot directly to the heart of yourself or another willing creature.
	You are protected against contamination for six hours after receiving a dose of aqua expurgo. During this time, whenever you fail a saving throw against an effect that would cause you to gain one or more contamination levels, you can choose to succeed instead. You can use this ability three times, after which the effects of aqua expurgo expire.
	If the effects of aqua expurgo expire in this manner, you immediately take 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and become incapacitated for 1 minute while you violently retch corrupt bile. Your hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until you finish a long rest. You die if this effect reduces your hit point maximum to 0. The necrotic damage can't be reduced or prevented by any means.

    <text>This spherical glass orb contains an ignited delerium shard hovering gently within. Electrical currents of yellow, green, and purple energy streak from the crystal and cascade along the glass, rendering it warm to the touch.
	As an action you can throw the orb up to 30 feet. It shatters on impact, releasing a 20-foot-radius burst of contaminated energy. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution save or take (8d6) necrotic damage, and take one level of contamination. In addition, an arcane anomaly (see Dungeons of Drakkenheim) occurs, centred on the point of impact.

    <text>While wearing this amulet, you can read all writing, and speak and understand any language.
	You can use an action to cast one of the following spells: detect thoughts, sending, or Rary's telepathic bond. Once the amulet has been used to cast one of these spells, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. You can choose your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score as the spellcasting ability for casting these spells, and use your proficiency bonus to determine their attack bonus and saving throw DC.

Crown Authority: A character cannot attune to more than one Seal of Drakkenheim. Guardian constructs in Drakkenheim such as wall gargoyles and tower dragons do not attack you while you are attuned to one of the Seals of Drakkenheim. An individual guardian ignores this effect for 24 hours if you attack it or cast a spell upon it.
	As an action, you may present a Seal of Drakkenheim to rebuke the guardians. You make an opposed Charisma ability check against each wall gargoyle or tower dragon that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you. If you win the contest, the creature is rebuked for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A rebuked creature doesn't move, and can't take actions or reactions. A creature who wins the contest is immune to your rebuke for 24 hours.

    <text>A character may only attune to the Crown of Westemär by performing a special one hour ceremony with six other characters who are each attuned to a different Seal of Drakkenheim. See the "Developments" section in Chapter 9: Castle Drakken for details on this ritual.
	The crown has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge to cast the wish spell from it. The crown regains one expended charge every ten years.
	The ancient bronze dragon Minazorond, the tower dragons, and the wall gargoyles are under your control and obey your spoken commands while you wear the crown.
	While wearing the crown and seated on the Throne of Drakkenheim in Castle Drakken, you may use an action to communicate telepathically with one dragon or twelve gargoyles so long as they are within 100 miles of Castle Drakken. When you do, you can issue commands to those creatures, see through one of the creature's eyes, and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the creature has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.

    <text>This focus is made from a refined delerium crystal encased in a glass orb. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your spells. In addition, you can use the crystal as a spellcasting focus.
	Once per day when you cast a spell of 5th level or lower, you may draw on the energy stored within the crystal to do so without expending a spell slot. If you do, you trigger a random arcane anomaly (see Dungeons of Drakkenheim).

	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
	The tank has 5 charges. You can use an action and expend one or more charges from the tank to cast burning hands (Save DC 15). For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.
	Once per day, you can pour a vial of alchemist's fire into the tank. When you do, it regains all expended charges. It otherwise does not regain charges on its own.

Special: You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

    <text>This sacred weapon was forged to burn away deception and darkness. Blazing embers gently fall from the silver blade, first ignited by the brazier in the Temple of Lumen.
	You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the following additional properties:
	You can use a bonus action to speak the sword's name, causing radiant flames to erupt from the blade. These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the sword is ablaze, it deals an extra 4d6 radiant damage to any target it hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to douse the blade, or until you drop or sheathe the sword.

Sentience: Ignacious is a sentient lawful good weapon with an Intelligence of 11, a Wisdom of 19, and a Charisma of 23. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The weapon can speak, read, and understand Common, Celestial, and Draconic, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. It always knows its wielder's thoughts. Its voice is commanding, righteous, and booming. When drawn, Ignacious casts the zone of truth spell (save DC 20), and maintains concentration on it so that you don't have to. The zone of truth moves with the blade and remains centred on it.

Personality: Ignacious is zealously devoted to the Sacred Flame, and has memorized every word of its holy texts. The blade wishes to be wielded by a faithful devotee of any sort; Ignacious does not care about the religious divide between the Falling Fire and the Sacred Flame so long as its wielder keeps the core tenets shared by both sects.
	The sword's purpose is to expose all deception and reveal the truth. It does not tolerate any falsehood, duplicitousness, or lies. The sword always knows when it hears a lie, and responds with wrathful fury. If a wielder speaks a lie, it immediately triggers a conflict.

Relics of Saint Vitruvio: These holy relics of the Sacred Flame were wielded by Saint Vitruvio and are kept in several religious sites throughout Drakkenheim.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

	The staff has 20 charges, and regains 2d10 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff triggers a random arcane anomaly (see Dungeons of Drakkenheim). On a 20, the staff regains 1d10 charges.
	While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: haste (3 charges), slow (3 charges), arcane eye (4 charges), dimension door (4 charges), Bigby's hand (5 charges), wall of force (5 charges), disintegrate (6 charges), reverse gravity (7 charges), or maze (8 charges).

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>You can use an action to cast one of the following spells from the phylactery: bless, death ward, greater restoration, prayer of healing, or revivify. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC. Once the phylactery has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.

Crown Authority: A character cannot attune to more than one Seal of Drakkenheim. Guardian constructs in Drakkenheim such as wall gargoyles and tower dragons do not attack you while you are attuned to one of the Seals of Drakkenheim. An individual guardian ignores this effect for 24 hours if you attack it or cast a spell upon it.
	As an action, you may present a Seal of Drakkenheim to rebuke the guardians. You make an opposed Charisma ability check against each wall gargoyle or tower dragon that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you. If you win the contest, the creature is rebuked for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A rebuked creature doesn't move, and can't take actions or reactions. A creature who wins the contest is immune to your rebuke for 24 hours.

Relics of Saint Vitruvio: These holy relics of the Sacred Flame were wielded by Saint Vitruvio and are kept in several religious sites throughout Drakkenheim. The Knights of the Silver Order and the Followers of the Falling Fire now seek these relics. Not only do both factions revere Saint Vitruvio, both wish to use these relics to help advance their goals in Drakkenheim.
	A character attuned to three Relics of Saint Vitruvio may cast the heal spell three times per day, after which they must finish a long rest before they may do so again. In addition, that character gains the ability to attune to two additional magic items so long as those magic items are both Relics of Saint Vitruvio.

    <text>This shield is constructed from hammered meteoric iron and embossed with a delerium crystal. When you are hit with a melee or ranged attack while wielding this shield, you can use your reaction to absorb residual energy from the attack. You suffer damage and effects from the attack as normal, and the shield gains 1 charge. The shield can have a maximum of 5 charges. Unexpended charges are lost each day at dawn.
	As an action while wielding the shield, you can expend all its charges to release a forceful blast. Creatures within 10 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, creatures in the area take 1d6 force damage for each expended charge, and are flung back 10 feet and knocked prone.

	Once on your turn, when you hit a creature with a melee attack using this weapon, you can force the target to make a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it takes an extra 3d6 psychic damage and can't take reactions until the start of your next turn. In addition, on its next turn, the creature must choose to take an action, bonus action, or move: it may only do one of the three.

If you expend the last charge, you immediately gain 1d6 levels of contamination.

Spells: While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: delerium orb (1 charge), warp bolt (2 charges), ride the rifts (3 charges), delerium blast (4 charges), conjure the deep haze (5 charges), and ray of contamination (6 charges). You don't gain any contamination levels when you cast these spells using charges from this staff.
