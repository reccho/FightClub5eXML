    <text>The head of this bludgeoning weapon is made from a massive delerium crystal that crackles with arcane energies. When you hit with an attack using this weapon, the target takes an extra (3d6) necrotic damage.
	When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, it unleashes an arcane anomaly (see Dungeons of Drakkenheim). You can roll twice on the table and choose either result.

Arcane Anomalies:
1d20 | Arcane Anomalies
1 | Gravity breaks within a 100-foot radius area for 1 hour. Creatures levitate in midair, and must move by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows them to move as if they were climbing. Unattended objects float around randomly.
2 | The nearest creature is affected by a hideous laughter spell (Save DC 15) but instead of laughing, the creature repeats unfathomable combinations of syllables and words.
3 | Time skips a beat. Creatures within 60 feet experience a palpable feeling of vertigo followed by a powerful sensation of deja vu and are stunned for 1 round (No save).
4 | The nearest creature becomes unstuck in time. It is affected by the blink spell for 1 minute. Instead of vanishing into the Ethereal Plane, the creature vanishes into a sliver of time in its past or possible future.
5 | A prismatic burst of energy erupts in a 20-foot radius. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 8d6 radiant damage and become blinded for 1 round. The smell of ozone fills the area, and wood transforms into glass.
6 | Echoes of possible realities are briefly visible for 1 minute. When a creature within 60 feet is hit by an attack, a faint vision of the creature being killed by that attack appears.
7 | Discordant music fills the mind of all creatures within 30 feet, who are affected as if by irresistible dance (Save DC 15).
8 | A section of stone, water, air, or energy becomes an appropriate contaminated elemental.
9 | An extraplanar creature is summoned and remains for 1 hour. The DM either chooses the creature or determines it randomly. It is friendly to the creature who triggered the anomaly.
10 | All humanoid corpses within 120 feet animate as hostile haze husks. The shrieking undead beg frantically for forgiveness as they rip apart the living.
11 | The shadows of 1d6 random creatures in the area animate and try to kill them. Once destroyed, the creatures don't cast a shadow for 24 hours.
12 | All creatures within 60 feet become invisible for 1 min or until they attack or cast a spell.
13 | Tendrils of life flow from the nearest creature to others. It must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 8d8 necrotic damage, half on a success. The three nearest creatures within 60 feet each regain hit points equal to the damage taken.
14 | A hypnotic pattern (save DC 15) appears. It creates scintillating impossible colours in shapes which are simply wrong. Creatures incapacitated by the spell weep uncontrollably.
15 | A black tentacles spell appears in the area for 1 hour (Escape DC 15).
16 | Objects within 60 feet come to life for the next hour, as if affected by the animate objects spell. They mumble awful truths, but are not otherwise hostile.
17 | The nearest creature is polymorphed into an awakened shrub for 1 hour or until reduced to 0 hp (No save).
18 | Time slows down for up to six randomly determined creatures within 120 feet of the anomaly. They are affected by the slow spell for 1 minute. (Save DC 15).
19 | Time speeds up for one randomly determined creature within 60 feet of the anomaly. They are affected by the haste spell for 1 minute.
20 | A bowl of flowers and a very surprised aquatic mammal appear 100 feet in the air. "Oh no, not again..." thinks the flowers.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Proficiency: simple, club

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

13 | Tendrils of life flow from the nearest creature to others. It must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 8d8 necrotic damage, half on a success. The three nearest creatures within 60 feet each regain hit points equal to the damage taken.
14 | A hypnotic pattern (save DC 15) appears. It creates scintillating impossible colours in shapes which are simply wrong. Creatures incapacitated by the spell weep uncontrollably.
15 | A black tentacles spell appears in the area for 1 hour (Escape DC 15).
16 | Objects within 60 feet come to life for the next hour, as if affected by the animate objects spell. They mumble awful truths, but are not otherwise hostile.
17 | The nearest creature is polymorphed into an awakened shrub for 1 hour or until reduced to 0 hp (No save).
18 | Time slows down for up to six randomly determined creatures within 120 feet of the anomaly. They are affected by the slow spell for 1 minute. (Save DC 15).
19 | Time speeds up for one randomly determined creature within 60 feet of the anomaly. They are affected by the haste spell for 1 minute.
20 | A bowl of flowers and a very surprised aquatic mammal appear 100 feet in the air. "Oh no, not again..." thinks the flowers.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>The head of this bludgeoning weapon is made from a massive delerium crystal that crackles with arcane energies. When you hit with an attack using this weapon, the target takes an extra (3d6) necrotic damage.
	When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, it unleashes an arcane anomaly (see Dungeons of Drakkenheim). You can roll twice on the table and choose either result.

Arcane Anomalies:
1d20 | Arcane Anomalies
1 | Gravity breaks within a 100-foot radius area for 1 hour. Creatures levitate in midair, and must move by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows them to move as if they were climbing. Unattended objects float around randomly.
2 | The nearest creature is affected by a hideous laughter spell (Save DC 15) but instead of laughing, the creature repeats unfathomable combinations of syllables and words.
3 | Time skips a beat. Creatures within 60 feet experience a palpable feeling of vertigo followed by a powerful sensation of deja vu and are stunned for 1 round (No save).
4 | The nearest creature becomes unstuck in time. It is affected by the blink spell for 1 minute. Instead of vanishing into the Ethereal Plane, the creature vanishes into a sliver of time in its past or possible future.
5 | A prismatic burst of energy erupts in a 20-foot radius. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 8d6 radiant damage and become blinded for 1 round. The smell of ozone fills the area, and wood transforms into glass.
6 | Echoes of possible realities are briefly visible for 1 minute. When a creature within 60 feet is hit by an attack, a faint vision of the creature being killed by that attack appears.
7 | Discordant music fills the mind of all creatures within 30 feet, who are affected as if by irresistible dance (Save DC 15).
8 | A section of stone, water, air, or energy becomes an appropriate contaminated elemental.
9 | An extraplanar creature is summoned and remains for 1 hour. The DM either chooses the creature or determines it randomly. It is friendly to the creature who triggered the anomaly.
10 | All humanoid corpses within 120 feet animate as hostile haze husks. The shrieking undead beg frantically for forgiveness as they rip apart the living.
11 | The shadows of 1d6 random creatures in the area animate and try to kill them. Once destroyed, the creatures don't cast a shadow for 24 hours.
12 | All creatures within 60 feet become invisible for 1 min or until they attack or cast a spell.

Arcane Focus: An arcane focus is a special item designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus.

    <text>This piece of ammunition has a refined delerium arrowtip. A creature hit by a ranged attack using one of these arrows takes an extra (3d6) necrotic damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of contamination. Once it hits a target, the delerium tip crumbles to dust and the arrow becomes nonmagical.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

A creature hit by a ranged attack using one of these arrows takes an extra (3d6) necrotic damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of contamination. Once it hits a target, the delerium tip crumbles to dust and the arrow becomes nonmagical.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

    <text>Ammo: crossbow bolt

This magical bow or crossbow has an intricate arrangement of delerium shards and focusing lenses along the stock where a bolt would normally be loaded, and instead magically conjures its own projectiles. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals radiant damage instead of piercing damage and ignores the ammunition and loading properties.
	The weapon has 3 charges, which are regained each day at dawn. When you hit with a ranged attack using it, you can cause the bolt to explode in a brilliant flash of light. The target you hit and any creatures within 10 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of your next turn.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.
