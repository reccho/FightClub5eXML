    <text>When you cast this spell, you gain one level of contamination.
	You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of the Deep Haze on a point you choose within range. The fog spreads around corners. It lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses the fog, ending the spell. Its area is heavily obscured.
	When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, it suffers (8d6) necrotic damage and gains one level of contamination. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and does not gain any contamination levels. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe.

    <text>When you cast this spell, you gain one level of contamination. You draw unrestrained arcane magic from the delerium shard you hold in your hand. Until the spell ends, you gain the following benefits:

	• When you cast a spell that deals acid, fire, cold, lightning, or poison damage, you can change the damage type to force, necrotic, psychic, or radiant damage.

	• Once per turn when you deal damage with a spell, you can deal an extra 1d12 necrotic damage for each contamination level you have gained to one target of that spell.

	• When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can choose to gain one level of contamination. If you do, one target of the spell has disadvantage on its first saving throw made against that spell.

This spell can't be dispelled by dispel magic.

Discovering the Spell: A character who can cast 8th level spells, knows every other contaminated spell, and has cast each of them at least once can research contaminated power.

    <text>When you cast this spell, you gain one level of contamination.
	You ignite arcane energies stored inside a delerium fragment held in your hand, and hurl it towards a space you can see within range. It explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere of erratic psychic energy that overwhelms the minds and senses of those within. Each creature in the sphere must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes (10d6) psychic damage and becomes incapacitated until the end of their next turn. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage and suffers none of the spell's other effects.

The target must succeed on a saving throw using the chosen ability score; it takes 6d6 damage of the chosen type on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a successful one.

    <text>When you cast this spell, you gain one level of contamination. Octarine rays of light flash from your hand. Each ray is a different colour and has a different power and purpose, see the table below. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must succeed on a Constitution saving throw. For each target, roll a d8 to determine which colour ray affects it

Octarine Spray:
d8 | Effect
1 | The target takes 20d6 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.
2 | The target takes 20d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.
3 | The target takes 20d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.
4 | The target takes 20d6 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.
5 | The target takes 20d6 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.
6 | At the start of each of its turns, the affected target uses all its movement to move directly towards the closest creature it can see. Then, the affected target uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the affected target does nothing this turn. At the end of each of its turns, the affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.
7 | At the start of each of its turns, the affected target gains one level of contamination. At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Constitution saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target, but any contamination levels gained remain.
8 | Special: The target is struck by an additional ray. Roll again twice. There's no limit to how many additional rays can strike a single creature in this manner.

    <text>This spell may only be cast in an area covered by the Deep Haze.
	You perform a holy ceremony involving up to 12 faithful and willing humanoid creatures that ends when each participating creature drives a delerium shard into their chest. Those creatures become sanctified (see the Followers of the Falling Fire dossier in chapter 3 of Dungeons of Drakkenheim).
	When you finish casting this spell, a hostile shadow appears and attacks each participant, as a manifestation of that character's inner darkness. The GM may determine that a character who carries great anger, fear, or hate in their heart causes a wraith to manifest instead.

    <text>This demanding spell transfers contamination from one creature to another. When you cast this spell, you must first touch either a willing humanoid creature with one or more levels of contamination, or a former humanoid creature whose current form is the result of a monstrous transformation. You then touch a different willing humanoid creature.
	If both creatures touched were willing humanoid creatures, you remove all contamination levels and mutations from the first creature, then the second creature you touch gains a number of contamination levels equal to the number of levels removed from the first creature.
	If the first creature you touch is a former humanoid who suffered a monstrous contamination, and the second creature is a willing humanoid creature with a character level or challenge rating equal to or higher than the challenge rating of the transformed creature, you restore the fully contaminated creature to its original form, then the humanoid creature immediately undergoes a monstrous transformation as if it had gained six contamination levels.
	The second creature touched cannot prevent or negate these contamination levels or an ensuing transformation in any way, or else the spell fails with no effect.

Researching the Spell: A character who can cast 6th level spells who knows the spells forced evolution and neutralizing field, and has witnessed another creature undergo a monstrous transformation may research siphon contamination.

	You can create a new bolt of lightning as your action on any turn until the spell ends.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target 1 additional creature for each spell level above 2nd.
