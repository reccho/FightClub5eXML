      <text>d8 | Defining Event
1 | I was well celebrated in my city as a slayer of a great troll.
2 | I witnessed the death of my family during the civil war. They were targets for their ties to the von Kessel name.
3 | I led my knights to victory in defending our castle during a raid in the war.
4 | I lost a lot of good soldiers in an earlier expedition into Drakkenheim. We never made it past the gate.
5 | My house was an enemy of the von Kessel family and had many battles with them.
6 | I broke ties with my family when they folded to the Silver Order.
7 | I am related, not to a king or queen, but to a noble figure who sat in the small council and made important decisions for their represented house.
8 | My family lost everything in the destruction of Drakkenheim. We are noble only in name, no longer in standing.</text>

      <text>d8 | Personality Trait
1 | I consider myself a renowned monster slayer, and like to remind everyone of the many accomplishments I hold to my name.
2 | I keep family traditions close. Honour and family are amongst the most important things in the world, and I cherish them.
3 | I miss the comforts of my home. This city is dirty and smells terrible.
4 | I believe in the good in people, and I hope to find a peaceful resolution to our problems. A diplomatic approach is something Westemär greatly needs.
5 | As a noble, I have a responsibility to protect those who cannot protect themselves.
6 | It is highly important that I look my best and maintain my regal demeanor in all situations. My reputation must go untarnished.
7 | I may be of noble birth, but have lived life on the road for some time. I am more than willing to share what I have with others, as I am no better or worse than anyone else.
8 | There is no challenge I can't face. I heard about the horrors and monsters of this world, and I am what they fear the most.

d6 | Ideal
1 | Respect. I am a respected member of my family, and I expect what remains of Drakkenheim's nobility and royal line to acknowledge my standing. (Lawful)
2 | Responsibility. It is my responsibility as a representative of my noble line to remain cordial, and diplomatic in dealings with the various high ranking members of Drakkenheim's society. (Good)
3 | Privacy. I do not wish for my nobility to come up. It may be best if the people of Drakkenheim do not know who I am. At least for now. (Any)
4 | Duty. It is my duty to aid the people of Drakkenheim. As a noble I was connected to this city, and it is what is expected of me. (Good)
5 | Glory. I must claim my victories and prove myself in battle. (Any)
6 | Family. Blood is thicker than water and I will fight to defend my family's honour. (Good)

d6 | Bond
1 | I must prove myself as a great warrior for my house and my people.
2 | My family was once bound to the royal family of Westemär, I must ensure we remain bound to whoever takes the throne.
3 | My family's fortune was lost. Drakkenheim may be our last chance to get it back.
4 | My family was betrayed by one of the royal houses, and I plan to make sure any that remain of that name are brought to justice and my family takes its place where it belongs.
5 | I am destined to rule, as my ancestors before me have.
6 | I have been sent unwillingly on a diplomatic mission to Drakkenheim. I am to gain political standing in these crumbling ruins.

d6 | Flaw
1 | I boast about my own triumphs, and belittle the accomplishments of others.
2 | Bound by honor, I can never back down from a challenge, nor can I let those who undervalue my name go unchallenged.
3 | I do not like getting my hands dirty. Other people must do the heavy lifting, not me.
4 | I like to flaunt my wealth, and I spare no expense.
5 | I'm never wrong. Even if I was, I would never admit it.
6 | I was forced to lead, but I am very far out of my depth and desperately hoping people do not catch on that I don't know what I am doing here.</text>

d6 | Bond
1 | It is my duty to protect the Amethyst Academy.
2 | My life's work in the study of delerium caused my expulsion. I must continue that research to prove its value.

2 | I believe my plan is always far superior to everyone else's.
3 | I am distracted by possibilities of gaining knowledge or power, regardless of the cost or danger.

6 | I can't get enough delerium. I want the power for myself.</text>
