      <name>Cursed Gaze</name>
      <text>A humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of and able to see the ancient corpse walker must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw, provided the corpse walker isn't incapacitated. On a failure, the humanoid is frightened for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if not averting its eyes from the corpse walker, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature failing two of these saving throws becomes cursed with disturbing thoughts. Such a creature can't benefit from a short or long rest until the curse is removed. On a successful save, the target is immune to any corpse walker's Cursed Gaze for the next 24 hours.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw. If the creature does so, it can't see the corpse walker until the start of its next turn. A creature that looks at the corpse walker in the meantime must immediately make the save.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Spore Calling</name>
      <text>When the ancient corpse walker attacks, loyal undead within 120 feet of it come to its aid. Moderate or stronger wind can disperse these spores before they are effective.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Spore Cloud</name>
      <text>If the ancient corpse walker isn't in sunlight, it can use its action to polymorph into a Large cloud of spores or back into its true form. Anything it's wearing or carrying transforms with it. It reverts to its true form if it dies. In cloud form, the ancient corpse walker can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It's weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. This cloud spreads around corners. If air can pass through a space, the cloud can do so without squeezing, but it can't pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, except those against wind. The cloud form is immune to nonmagical damage other than that from sunlight.

A creature that starts its turn in the cloud must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes 13 3d8 poison and 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and becomes poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the damage and isn't poisoned.

After 24 hours, corpses of beasts or humanoids that were in the spore area rise as zombies loyal to the ancient corpse walker. If such a corpse is that of an evil humanoid, it instead rises as a corpse walker loyal to the ancient corpse walker. These spores can animate a corpse only once.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Spore Fortitude</name>
      <text>If damage reduces the ancient corpse walker to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the corpse walker drops to 1 hit point instead. When it drops to 0 hit points, the ancient corpse walker transforms into its Spore Cloud form. If it can't transform, it is destroyed. The spores of this cloud deal half their normal damage and can't animate corpses.

The ancient corpse walker can't transform back into its true form until it has at least 1 hit point. It must reach its preferred resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its normal form.

It is then paralyzed and at 0 hit points for 1 hour, and then it regains 1 hit point and ceases being paralyzed.

If the ancient corpse walker takes damage while at 0 hit points, if able, it makes the same saving throw that would allow it to drop to 1 hit point. However, on a success, the ancient corpse walker remains at 0 hit points. If the ancient corpse walker fails or can't make this saving throw, it is destroyed.</text>

If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the ancient corpse walker regains hit points equal to that amount. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain this way rises 24 hours later as a zombie, but it rises as a corpse walker if it was evil. These undead are loyal to the ancient corpse walker.</text>

Judgement:
Creatures who start their turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 25 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature gains a level of exhaustion as intensified feelings of guilt, doubt, remorse, and selfcriticism overwhelm the affected creature. Creatures who succeed on the saving throw are immune to the effect for one hour.

Valor:
Creatures who start their turn in the aura gain 15 temporary hit points, cannot be charmed or frightened, and have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects</text>

      <text>he seraph presents objects of desire, which can be illusions the seraph creates, to creatures of its choice. If those creatures are within 60 feet of the seraph, able to see it and the desirable objects, and able to hear the seraph, the creatures must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by the seraph until the seraph is incapacitated or fails to use a bonus action on its turn to continue to present and speak about the desirable objects.

While charmed in this way, a target can take no reactions and can use its action only to Dash. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet from the seraph, the target must move as far as it can toward the seraph, trying to come within 5 feet. The target avoids obvious danger, including opportunity attacks. If the target can't avoid such danger, the target can repeat the saving throw before entering the dangerous area. While an affected creature is within 5 feet of the seraph, the creature can't take reactions and spends its turns staring at the desirable objects.

The target also repeats the saving throw if the target is subjected to a harmful effect, if the target can't see or hear the seraph, and at the end of each of the target's turns. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the effect ends for it. A target that successfully saves is immune to the Voice of Avarice of this seraph or any lesser seraph for the next 24 hours.</text>

The charmed creature regards the bone trader as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the bone trader's control, it takes the bone trader's requests or actions in the most favorable way. Each time the bone trader or its allies do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the bone trader dies, is on a different plane of existence from the target, or ends the effect as a bonus action. If a target's saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the bone trader's fey charm for the next 24 hours.

The bone trader can have no more than one humanoid charmed at a time, along with up to three beasts.</text>

While it has at least one thornlamm attached to its vines, the caprathorn can use a bonus action to consume or detach a thornlamm. If the caprathorn consumes a thornlamm, the caprathorn regains 21 hit points. When the caprathorn detaches a thornlamm, that thornlamm lands in a space within 10 feet of the caprathorn and takes a turn immediately after the caprathorn. The thornlamm obeys the caprathorn's verbal or telepathic commands (no action for the caprathorn). If issued no commands, the thornlamm acts independently, often attacking a creature that isn't its ally. A thornlamm can survive indefinitely detached from a caprathorn.</text>

For objects that aren't worn or carried, this emanation destroys Small and smaller ones and damages larger ones. The circle destroys a wall of force or similar structures of force in the area instantly. A creature or object is disintegrated if it drops to 0 hit points due to this magic.

Military organizations such as the Free Swords issue bounties on corpsejaws to prevent damage to valuable salvage.

The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried rises the following night as a vampire spawn under this vampire's control.</text>

    <action>
      <name>Fey Majesty</name>
      <text>The vampire targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see or hear the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or be charmed. The charmed target regards the vampire as a friend to be heeded and protected. Although not under the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's requests in the most favorable way and is a willing target for the vampire's bite.

While the target is charmed, the vampire can communicate with the target telepathically within 300 feet. The vampire can use a bonus action to force the target to repeat the saving throw. If the save fails, the vampire can render the creature full of despair (disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls) or confused (as the {@spell confusion spell) for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the despair or confusion on itself on a success.

Each time the vampire or the vampire's allies do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire dies, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.</text>

    <action>
      <name>Mist Form</name>
      <text>The vampire polymorphs into a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form. Anything it wears or carries transforms with it. While in mist form, the vampire can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 30 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, but it can't pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. A vampire in mist form is immune to nonmagical damage, except damage from sunlight, and has resistance to damage other than radiant. The vampire reverts to its true form if it dies.</text>
    </action>
    <reaction>
      <name>Misty Escape</name>
      <text>When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into its Mist Form instead of falling unconscious. If the vampire can't transform, it dies.

While it has 0 hit points in mist form, the vampire dies if it takes damage three times or radiant damage once. It can't willingly revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or die. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.</text>

    <description>"The Scourge of the North is an undead dragon named Gegazol. If I hear her name, I get the hell out of there. She's powerful, cunning, and treacherous. And she's rarely alone—she always has one army or another behind her."

Gegazol's Lair:
The Scourge's lair is the sinkhole cave on an island off the northernmost shores of Etharis, north of even the raging coldfire. In this cave, the daemon's skull sits. It rests at the bottom of a deep, wet cavern upon a pedestal carved into the earth. Magic wards protect the crack above the skull. Gegazol's Immortals, a brutal cadre of undead warriors the dragon created or conquered, guard the expanded catacombs around the shrine. Gegazol needs no rest, but between campaigns, she lounges within the shrine, curled around the skull's pedestal. The whole place stinks of decay, making the site nauseating. While in her lair, Gegazol's Stench radius increases to 120 feet.

Lair Actions:
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Gegazol takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects. Gegazol can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.

Tendrils of necrotic power rise and reach for living creatures within the lair. Each living creature in the lair must attempt a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or take 13 (3d8) necrotic damage and gain one level of exhaustion until initiative count 20 on the next round.

Gegazol crashes her wings upon the ground, and rime spreads in a sphere with a 120-foot radius around her. This sphere spreads around corners and creates difficult terrain made of ice. Creatures in that area must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. Those who fail take 18 (4d8) cold damage and are grappled (escape DC 21). On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn't grappled. The difficult terrain disappears on initiative count 20 on the next round.

Gegazol creates an opaque wall of black ice on a solid surface she can see within 120 feet of her. The wall is made up of twenty contiguous 10-foot square panels that are each 2 feet thick. When the wall appears, each creature in its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall the creature wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 60 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears when Gegazol uses this lair action again or when she dies.

The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. This smoke lasts until the start of the mjork's next turn or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. Unless dispersed before the start of the mjork's next turn, a sootling swarm forms in a space in the area, favoring a space a creature hostile to the mjork occupies. The swarm takes its turn just after the mjork and obeys the mjork's verbal commands (no action for the mjork). If issued no commands, the swarm acts independently, often attacking a creature that isn't its ally. The swarm can survive indefinitely after being created.</text>

      <text>A humanoid who touches a Sitri cat must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become infected with the Seven Shades of Sitri. If a humanoid succeeds on the saving throw, they're immune to the disease for 24 hours. Carnal urges overwhelm an infected humanoid. When the infected interacts with another non-hostile humanoid, the infected becomes charmed by that humanoid until the subject of the infatuation or their friends harm the infected. The infected can repeat the saving throw once every 24 hours. Current infatuations end when one of these saves succeeds. The disease ends for the infected when they have succeeded on five saving throws.</text>

    <description>Disease is no stranger to the people of Etharis. The virulent Weeping Pox has devastated towns and families, and the Tears of the Hungerer is rumored to be a poison designed by necromancers. Other afflictions, such as the Seven Shades of Sitri and the Faith Cough, are not deadly but can impede even the strongest body. These diseases can be carried by animals, breaking their normal method of transmission. A twist of nature or foul magic has created carriers, some intentionally and some aggressively, that spread sickness quickly.

      <text>The spythronar swarm weaves webbing, covering a 5-foot square. The swarm can then give up 1 hit point to create a spythronar sac in that space. If the swarm's webbing covers a 10-foot square, it can give up 23 hit points as part of the same action, creating a spythronar web with the same number of hit points. The swarm can't drop to 0 hit points to create a sac or web.

If the swarm weaves an incomplete web, that web is a normal web rather than a sentient, monstrous one. A creature that enters this normal web's space must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or become grappled (escape DC 10) and restrained while grappled in this way. Each 5-foot square of this web has AC 10; the damage vulnerabilities, immunities, and resistances of a spythronar web; and 5 hit points.</text>

      <text>When the dragon dies, it exudes a cloud of sickening, accursed gas.

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. However, a creature that fails two of these saving throws becomes cursed. A creature cursed in this way takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and can't regain hit points, and the creature's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. Every 24 hours, the cursed creature takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage with similar reduction to the creature's hit point maximum. If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies.</text>
