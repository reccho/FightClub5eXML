    <trait>
      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Isolated from the political struggles of urban Tal'Dorei, you are a member of the Ashari people—a society bound to an ancient covenant protecting the Material Plane from the chaos of the primordial elements. You've been raised to revere and protect the natural world, and to shepherd the tumultuous elemental forces that give it life. When the elements threaten to overwhelm the delicate balance of nature, it is the role of the Ashari to restore harmony.
	You grew up in a tight-knit society, bound to a leader who successfully returned from the traditional journey to the Elemental Planes known as an Aramante. By contrast, you might well have never traveled more than a few days from your home, and thus have closer bonds with your family and neighbors than many people of Tal'Dorei.
	In your early life, you likely took up one of the many roles that make up your society, whether homemaker, hunter, explorer, or protector. If you have the ability to use elemental magic, you might have had one of the most important duties of all: protecting and soothing the elemental rift at the heart of your home. And even as an adventurer now traveling far beyond that home, your loyalties still lie with the continued safety of your order. Whatever else you do as you learn about the new world around you, you're conscious of the need to gather allies to your cause.
	Each Ashari is tethered to one of the four elemental orders and their settlements. You must select Pyrah (fire), Vesrah (water), Terrah (earth), or Zephrah (wind). The rifts of earth and air are both in Tal'Dorei. If you live or lived among your people, then you are familiar with the remarkable sights of Air Ashari on skysails above the Summit Peaks, or Earth Ashari erupting from the solid stone of the Cliffkeep Mountains on their earthboards (see page 198 for these magic items' game statistics).

	• Skill Proficiencies: Nature, plus your choice of Arcana or Survival
	• Tool Proficiencies: Herbalism kit
	• Languages: Primordial (Aquan, Auran, Ignan, or Terran, depending on the elemental affinity of your tribe)
	• Equipment: A set of traveler's clothes, a staff carved with symbols of your tribe, an herbalism kit, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp

      <name>Feature: Elemental Harmony</name>
      <text>Growing up surrounded by wild elemental magics has attuned your senses to those chaotic forces, enabling you to subtly bend them to your will. As an action, you channel minor magic involving the element of your chosen Ashari order, giving you one of the following abilities:

Pyrah. You instantaneously create and control a burst of flame small enough to light a candle, a torch, or a small campfire. Alternatively, you snuff out a flame of the same size.

Terrah. You instantaneously create a small rock no larger than a gold coin. The rock appears in your hand, then turns to dust after 1 minute.

Vesrah. You instantaneously create enough hot or cold water to fill a small drinking vessel.

Zephrah. You create an instantaneous puff of wind strong enough to blow papers off a desk or mess up someone's hair.</text>

      <text>The Ashari hold themselves removed from the rest of Tal'Dorei by their own choice. This makes many Ashari naive to the ways of the world beyond their homes—but it can also make them determined, steadfast, and tightly focused on their goals. Ever since Keyleth, Voice of the Tempest and leader of the Zephrah, became a world-renowned hero, the Air Ashari at least have become more familiar to Tal'Dorei's other peoples. They are known to welcome outsiders to their mountaintop enclave, and to take on quests that force them to leave their isolated home.
	To learn more about your character's Ashari order, see "The Ashari" on page 48.

d8 | Personality Trait
1 | I like to keep my hands busy, no matter where I am.
2 | I love to explore new places and meet new people.
3 | I meditate at dawn each day—and I can't stand it when my routine is interrupted.
4 | I like noticing patterns in the world around me, whether or not they mean anything.
5 | I don't let anything—or anyone—stand in the way of my mission.
6 | I'm a plain talker, even with people who outrank me.
7 | I've always got some of my native element with me in some form. (This might be modeling clay, pure water, special burning incense, or a bottled cloud.)
8 | I talk with everyone like I've known them all my life. Because most people I know, I have known all my life!

d6 | Ideal
1 | Destiny. I believe that everyone has a role to play. Now I just have to find mine. (Neutral)
2 | Community. It's important to surround yourself with people you can count on, and who will support you. (Good)
3 | Knowledge. I want to learn everything I can about the Elemental Planes—and maybe even visit them myself. (Neutral)
4 | Freedom. I don't care what anyone says. Even if it causes problems, the elements must be free. And so should I. (Chaotic)
5 | Structure. The elements are in harmony when they are free to act as they will, within the safe boundaries set by the Ashari. People are much the same. (Lawful)
6 | Virtuous Cycle. If I see someone who needs help, I feel compelled to assist them. Surely they'll return the favor someday! (Good)

d6 | Bond
1 | I have a cousin in another Ashari tribe whom I've never met, but someday I want to visit my extended family.
2 | The leader of my tribe thinks I could be their successor, but I worry that I don't have enough experience to lead my people.
3 | A mysterious person killed a member of my family. I've left home to discover who the killer was—and to seek vengeance.
4 | My older sibling set out on their Aramante a year ago, and I haven't seen them since.
5 | When I was a baby, a giant eagle brought me to Zephrah. I love my family, but I often wonder who my birth parents are.
6 | I trust my animal friends more than any humanoid ally.

d6 | Flaw
1 | Big cities are overwhelming. I get nervous when surrounded by people I don't know.
2 | I know all too well that elemental power is dangerous—but I like playing around with it anyway.
3 | I get surly if I go too long without being in contact with my native element.
4 | I think the mission of my people is a fool's errand. They should abandon isolation, let the elements be, and enjoy the pleasures of the world!
5 | I can't stand it when people say one thing and mean another! Just say what you mean!
6 | Ugh, I know it's not right, but I can't help but look down on people who can't manipulate the elements. It's not like it's hard!</text>

    <proficiency>Deception</proficiency>
    <trait>
      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Whether you grew up in the mean streets of Kymal bamboozling foolish gamblers, or spent your youth pilfering loose coin from the pockets of Emon's many tourists, your lifestyle of deceiving-to-survive eventually drew the attention of the Clasp: a storied crime syndicate that has hideouts in every city in Tal'Dorei. In exchange for protection, a modicum of kinship, and a number of useful resources to further develop your craft as a criminal, you agreed to receive the brand of the Clasp and join their ranks.
	You might have spent time working the guild's most menial assignments, wandering the alleys as a simple cutpurse and filling your pockets with silver while you waited to climb the professional ladder. Or you might be a clever actor and liar, whose skill at blending in with all facets of society has made you an indispensable spy. Perhaps your swift technique with a blade led you to become a feared assassin for the Spireling leader of a local Clasp sect. Regardless, though the threat of the law is ever looming, the advantages to having a connection to such a powerful cartel greatly outweighs your paranoia. Most of the time.
	Since the Clasp is an organization, its members can rise in rank by proving their worth, by making the right friends in high places, or even through blackmail and bribery. You and the Game Master can decide together how your actions affect your rank in the Clasp, and what benefits that rank grants you.

	• Skill Proficiencies: Deception, plus your choice of Sleight of Hand or Stealth
	• Tool Proficiencies: Disguise kit, forgery kit, or thieves' tools (one of your choice)
	• Languages: Thieves' Cant
	• Equipment: A set of inconspicuous common clothes, a set of tools with which you're proficient, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp

    <trait>
      <name>Feature: A Favor in Turn</name>
      <text>You have gained enough clout in the Clasp that you can call in a favor from your contacts whenever you're close enough to a center of syndicate activity. A request for a favor can be no longer than 20 words, and is passed up the chain to an undisclosed Spireling for approval. This favor can take on any form subject to the approval of the GM, who decides how it is fulfilled. If muscle is requested, an NPC member of the Clasp (using statistics found in chapter 6) can temporarily aid your party. If money is needed, a small loan can be provided. If you've been imprisoned, Clasp operatives can look into breaking you out or paying off the jailer.
	At some point, the favor will be called in for repayment, often without warning. Refusing the call will result in your termination—literally. You might be called on to commit a specific burglary, or to pressure an Emonian dignitary to reveal a secret at an upcoming ball. The Clasp might even demand that you assassinate a specific person, with no questions asked or answered. It's the GM's prerogative to ensure that the syndicate's request is proportionate to the favor they bestowed—or that they compensate you in other ways for a service that goes beyond the scope of repaying the initial favor.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Variant Feature: Myriad Operative</name>
      <text>Your skill set might be similar to that of many members of the Clasp, but you work for a criminal organization that is far more sophisticated—and even less scrupulous. As a Myriad operative in Tal'Dorei, you might have been given a specific task that furthers that syndicate's hunger to expand beyond Wildemount, or which gives them an edge in their rivalry with the Clasp. Moreover, you understand the wisdom of keeping your activities secret from fellow criminals as well as law enforcement, since the agents of the Clasp will show you no mercy if your true identity is ever revealed.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
      <text>The Clasp enjoys a strange status in Tal'Dorei. The syndicate is a feared group of thieves and killers, whose name is often invoked only in whispers. But at the same time, the organization has a reputation for guerilla heroism, in response to its members having saved countless lives when the Chroma Conclave attacked Emon. And so like every Clasp member, your own reputation often swings between these two poles.
	Your bond is likely associated with your fellow Clasp members or the individual who introduced you to the syndicate. Your ideal probably involves establishing your importance and indispensability to the Clasp.

d8 | Personality Trait
1 | What's life without risk? I'm always willing to take a risk if the reward seems worth it.
2 | I only show my emotions around people I really trust.
3 | I don't need friends; I need allies. When I do make "friends," I only consider what they can do for me.
4 | I look for simple solutions. The world's full of tough problems, but a well-placed knife is a one-size-fits-all answer.
5 | Money talks. I don't. We've got an efficient relationship.
6 | I used to have one rule—don't get involved in other people's problems. Why are things so complicated now?
7 | Crime is a game, and I play to win. I have no sympathy for players who don't get that.
8 | This organization has a lot of folks who cling to ugly, brutal practices. I'm not like that. I'm a professional, and professionals have standards.

d6 | Ideal
1 | By Any Means. I complete jobs. Collateral damage isn't my problem. (Chaotic)
2 | Ambition. I will climb to the top of the ladder. Everything I do is a stepping-stone to a Spireling's position. (Neutral)
3 | Decisiveness. It's important to make up your mind so you can act swiftly and without delay. (Neutral)
4 | Honor. There's room in the Clasp for both good and evil. Every day, I awake and choose to do what's right. (Good)
5 | Family. The Clasp is family. Anything that's good for the family is good for me. (Lawful)
6 | Self-Interest. There are too many bleeding hearts in the Clasp these days. Doing the right thing means doing the thing that makes my life better. (Evil)

d6 | Bond
1 | I'd do anything—anything—to protect my comrades.
2 | I'll always be grateful to the Spireling who took me in when I was an orphaned kid.
3 | I was inspired to join the Clasp by the stories my parents told of being saved from the Chroma Conclave's attack on Emon. I can look past the organization's flaws.
4 | I was nearly killed by the Myriad. If the Clasp is the enemy of those villains, then the Clasp is my friend.
5 | I've got family back in the old town who are counting on me for money. They don't know how I get it, but they don't need to know.
6 | I joined the Clasp to become rich, powerful, and beloved. That's all there is to it.

d6 | Flaw
1 | I'm hopeless at organizing my belongings, and I'm always losing things.
2 | I get bored whenever a plan is going too smoothly. A win is always more fun when it's by the skin of my teeth!
3 | I've seen Spirelings walk out among cheering crowds of thousands. Gods, I wish that were me. I need that to be me.
4 | I'm rubbish with money, and never seem to leave town with a full purse. Keeps me coming back to the life, I suppose.
5 | I can't work with shoddy, makeshift thieves' tools. I need everything involving my work to be perfect.
6 | Any slight against me, no matter how small, is cause for revenge.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>You most likely came up through money or hailed from a family with social prestige if you were able to afford tuition at the Alabaster Lyceum in Emon. But whatever your origin, your interests and pursuits brought you to the hallowed halls of Tal'Dorei's highest place of learning, where you soaked in every lesson you could, hoping to better make your mark on the world. (Or at least you pretended to. Even at the Lyceum, every class has its slackers.) Eventually, though, the call to adventure pulled you from your studies, and you now face the challenge of keeping up with your education even as the tides of destiny threaten to sweep you away.
	You might have come to the Lyceum to better research and understand the history and lore of Exandria and the lands you call home. Perhaps you sought a future here as a professor—or you might hope to do so still. You could also have been drawn by the promise of prosperity in politics, learning the inner workings of government and alliances to better position yourself as a future writer of history. Or perhaps your knack for the arcane inspired you to attend the Lyceum to refine your spellcraft, following in the footsteps of some of the finest wizards to ever practice the arts of magic.
	When you choose this background, you could be either an active student seeking adventures for your own research, or a graduated alumnus. With a little modification, you could easily be a professor as well.

	• Skill Proficiencies: Your choice of two of the following: Arcana, History, or Persuasion
	• Tool Proficiencies: Two of your choice

Whenever you're on Lyceum grounds or at another major academic institution, you can requisition any set of tools found in the fifth edition rules. Each set of tools is magically marked to sound an alarm if they are removed from the university's grounds.
	When you seek services such as spellcasting from an NPC at the Alabaster Lyceum or a related institution, you can use those services at a 25 percent discount, at the GM's discretion.</text>

If you came from a smaller city, a rural area, or Tal'Dorei's relatively uncharted wilderness, studying at the Lyceum might have left you with a sense of culture shock, for good or for ill.
	Your bond is likely associated with your goals as a student or graduate. Your ideal probably involves your hopes in using the knowledge you've gained at the Lyceum, and your travels as an adventurer, to tailor the world to your liking.

d8 | Personality Trait
1 | I can't believe I'm here! At the Alabaster Lyceum. Oh, gods, I've dreamed of this my whole life, and now I'm here!
2 | I can't believe I squandered all the opportunities I had at school. I was supposed to be learning good stuff, but I wasted it all daydreaming about fighting monsters.
3 | Every night at school, I'd knock back a couple of meads and read with my pals! Just a bunch of nerds having fun, and I loved it.
4 | Everyone at school was such a stick in the mud. Dressing the same, listening to the same bards…ugh, it's sad. Just be yourself.
5 | I'm happiest when I've got my little party with me. At school, it was like we were a squad of heroes, slaying projects like monsters.
6 | I'd really rather you didn't bother me. Can't you see I'm studying here?
7 | I don't care. I just don't care about it all. The dates I had to memorize, the formulae I learned…I just want to run away and live!
8 I'm just…tired. All the time. Oh, adventuring, sure, that's fine, as long as I can find time to… nap…goodnight.

d6 | Ideal
1 | Preparedness. I can't go out into the world unless I know what I'm up against. Study first, act later. (Neutral)
2 | Stardom. Having a team is good and all, but you can't win a game of ball without the star charger, and you know that's me. (Evil)
3 | Individuality. The world keeps us down by trying to put us all into little boxes. I'm tired of living in my box, and I don't care what you think about it. (Chaotic)
4 | Purpose. I study because there are things I need to know. I'll find my place in the world, and I'll make the world better. (Good)
5 | Code of Conduct. The student code is there to benefit all students, you know. It's the same for laws! (Lawful)
6 | Recreation. All this studying crap wasn't worth anything if you weren't partying when you were done. Meet me down at the tavern, okay? (Chaotic)

1 | I came to the Lyceum with no one, but I fell in love with the city of Emon. I've finally found a place that feels like home!

3 | My family saved every copper piece to give me the opportunities I have now. I can't let them down.
4 | I came to the Lyceum with a childhood friend, but we've long been drifting apart.
5 | Discovery is the only thing that matters to me. The topic doesn't matter. Books keep me company on my loneliest days.
6 | The Lyceum is my life. I'd give up anything—everything—to protect it from harm.

d6 | Flaw
1 | The Lyceum taught me to never want to leave my room. The campus was so huge, and the crowds were so horrible.
2 | You think you're so great just because you've got muscles, and endurance, and…shut up! Read a book sometime!
3 | Huh? What? Sorry, I was thinking about a test I need to retake when I get back to school...
4 | I spent too much time studying. Now I don't have any friends.
5 | If you don't match my aesthetic, I'm not interested in you. We can work together, but we won't be friends. Got it?
6 | I'm always striving for perfection. I got top of my class, sure, but only with a 98 average. And that's. Not. Perfect.</text>

      <text>Two pantheons have battled over the fate of Exandria since the world's founding—the Prime Deities and the Betrayer Gods. During the Calamity, the Prime Deities allied themselves with the mortal races of Exandria, their original creations, to protect their flawed world and its multifarious forms of life. The Betrayers sought to wipe the slate clean.
	At the end of that devastating war, the Prime Deities established a Divine Gate that would prevent all gods, good or evil, from directly affecting the world, but which would leave the gods' mortal followers and supernal servants to enact their will. And so the corrupting whispers of the Betrayer Gods have ensnared the minds of power-hungry mortals for centuries, promising them a sliver of the gods' great power in exchange for dedicating their souls to occult lore.
	You once belonged to such a cult of the Betrayer Gods. Perhaps this faith only briefly tempted your rebellious, youthful spirit. Perhaps the cult gave you love and family when you had none, asking only your adherence to their prophet in exchange. Or maybe you were raised from birth to pay homage to gods of selfish cruelty—until one fateful day the veil was lifted, so that nothing stood between you and the horrifying truth.
	However it happened, you were freed from the shackles of this poisonous sect. Yet you know that this group does not forgive betrayers. As long as you live, you will be hunted—and if the members of the cult think you dead, their hunt will begin again the second they learn they're wrong.

8 | My mind is always racing. I can't…I just need to…you have to give me a second—or else I can't…organize my thoughts.

d6 | Ideal
1 | Life. I've spent too long shackled to an evil master. No matter what happened before, I deserve my freedom now. (Chaotic)
2 | Redemption. People can change, but redemption must be something they choose for themselves. If they do, it is my duty to help them along that path. (Good)
3 | Power. When I abandoned the cult, it wasn't out of some misguided sense of righteousness. That pathetic organization was merely a shackle on my potential. (Evil)
4 | Vengeance. The cult has poisoned my life. I will see all its followers suffer. (Any)
5 | Hierarchy. The cult was vile, but its strength was in stability and organization. As long as good folk lack unity, evil will always triumph. (Lawful)
6 | Reparations. As a cultist, I harmed people whose names I'll never know. I feel obligated to repay my debt by aiding others. (Good)

d6 | Bond
1 | My cousin escaped the cult with me. I lost track of them when we fled, but I know they're alive. I can feel it.
2 | I was saved from the cult by a priest of one of the Prime Deities. If not for that sign of faith, I would surely be lost.
3 | I was told by the person who saved me that a sage once said: "Life needs things to live." I don't know what that means, but I've dedicated my existence to finding out.
4 | One of my cultist parents had a change of heart when I was a teenager, and we fled together in the dark of night. I didn't want to leave, but I understand now that their courage saved my life.
5 | I was bested by a warrior when I fumbled a cult-ordered assassination. I don't know why that person took pity on me, but they gave me purpose when I was lost.
6 | Now that I've saved myself, the only person important to me is my former cult leader—because I've sworn that they'll die by my hand.

d6 | Flaw
1 | I'm haunted by what I saw in those ritual chambers. Every time I see blood, I…oh, gods, I can't bear to even think about it.
2 | I ran from the cult long ago. But deep down, there's a part of me that still thinks they were right about certain things.
3 | I can't help but feel a rush whenever I see a life snuffed out before me. Just one more kill… just one more.
4 | Organized religion terrifies me. Betrayer Gods or Prime Deities…it doesn't matter. The sight of the faithful freezes my blood cold.
5 | Oh, I always tell the truth. Always. I've never had to keep a secret from anyone, so of course I'll be open with you.
6 | I don't trust easily. If you grew up being lied to about every little thing? The fundamental nature of the world? You wouldn't, either.</text>

You are also entrusted with a solemn duty—to never let the secrets of your liege-lord's deadly creations fall into the wrong hands.
	You might have come to Whitestone to prove yourself worthy of wielding the secretive and highly coveted firearms created there, and to seek instruction from warriors who have mastered those weapons. Or you might have grown up in Whitestone, perhaps even remembering the brutal days when Lord and Lady Briarwood ruled your homeland—a reign that began some thirty years ago and lasted for six harrowing years.
	Alternatively, you or your parents might have come to Whitestone as refugees fleeing the destruction of the Chroma Conclave's attack on Tal'Dorei. If so, your life in the city-state might have been a relatively peaceful one, dwelling among the engineers, artisans, and merchants seeking to capitalize upon Whitestone's reputation as an up-and-coming center of trade, culture, and invention.
	When you choose this background, decide whether you were a member of the Rifle Corps, the Pale Guard, or the Whitestone Hunters. The "Whitestone" section in chapter 3 has more information about the Pale Guard, as well as the armaments and militia in the city-state. See below for more information on the Whitestone Hunters.

	• Skill Proficiencies: Your choice of two of the following: Athletics, Perception, or Survival

	• Languages: One of your choice
	• Equipment: Your choice of a musket or a pistol, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp

      <name>Feature: Legacy of Secrecy</name>
      <text>You have been entrusted with the use and care of a weapon both powerful and terrifying. The rifle you wield might transform the face of warfare and life in Tal'Dorei. It is a weapon that haunts the mind of its creator, Percival de Rolo, manifesting as a pain that lives always behind his kind eyes.
	You were granted a musket or a pistol (as described in the fifth edition core rules) by your commander in the Whitestone Rifle Corps. This weapon is a symbol of your status, and when you display it, other folk around you—particularly adventurers, mercenaries, guards, engineers, and weapons enthusiasts—treat you differently. You might be seen as a noble defender of the people, a selfish hoarder of power, or anything in between, at the GM's discretion.</text>

      <name>Feature: Rifle Corps Relationship</name>
      <text>You are—or were—a member of an elite and trusted band of Whitestone's staunchest defenders. Work with your GM to determine your current relationship with the Rifle Corps. If your campaign starts in Whitestone, you might be an active member of that unit. Otherwise, you can use the Rifle Corps Relationships table for suggestions.

Rifle Corps Relationship:
d6 | Current Relationship
1 | I retired honorably from the Rifle Corps—and now it's time for me to pursue my own adventures.
2 | I'm on an important mission to protect Whitestone or guard one of our allies.
3 | Whitestone is in trouble, and I was sent away to seek help.
4 | I don't think firearms technology should be kept secret, so I escaped from the Rifle Corps with my weapon and am on the run.
5 | I was on a mission with my company when I got separated from them. Now I need to find my way back home.
6 | My weapon was stolen. I built a new one, but I can't return home until I've tracked down the thief and recovered the original. (Whitestone Hunter variant only)</text>

      <name>Variant Feature: Whitestone Hunter</name>
      <text>As elite as they are, the members of the Whitestone Rifle Corps do not represent the apex of firearms skill in Whitestone. A clandestine group of elite soldiers and survivalists is drawn secretly from the Rifle Corps ranks. Called the Whitestone Hunters, these soldiers are special operatives of the de Rolo family, and loyally serve as spies, bodyguards, and even assassins when the job requires it. Though few officially know of them, rumors of the Whitestone Hunters' existence swirl constantly throughout the city-state, often in response to their activities after having been loaned out to protect Whitestone's allies.
	You are one of these Whitestone Hunters, even if just a trainee (if you're starting your campaign at low levels). You have the ear of the lord and lady of Whitestone, though you must exercise this privilege graciously lest you lose it.</text>

      <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
      <text>Those who join the Whitestone Rifle Corps become members of an elite and trusted band known as the city-state's staunchest defenders. But this means working with your GM to determine why you're not at home protecting Whitestone. Perhaps you took on a mission to guard someone on behalf of the de Rolo family, or you might have been separated from your company while on an assignment. Either way, you find yourself embroiled now in a series of new adventures as you try to make your way back home.
	Your bond is likely associated with your comrades-in-arms or with Whitestone itself. Your ideal could be tied to justice or protection, but could also be a secretive, selfish perversion of those virtues.

d8 | Personality Trait
1 | I want to make a good impression at all times. That means keeping my clothes and gear clean and in top condition.
2 | I don't like being the center of attention. I'd rather let someone else do the talking while I watch their back.
3 | I feel safe only if I'm carrying my trusty rifle. And my dagger. And my concealed pistol. Oh, and of course my….
4 | I don't trust people with my secrets easily, so it feels like a big deal when someone else shares a secret with me.
5 | I like coming up with solutions to problems using my esoteric knowledge of natural philosophy.
6 | Everyone around me takes things so seriously. Sometimes I just want to let loose and have fun!
7 | Knowing things that other people don't know makes me feel special and important.
8 | I'm most at home in woods and mountains, where everything feels at once familiar, always growing and changing.

d6 | Ideal
1 | Responsibility. I have a duty to protect the people of Whitestone and to uphold the trust placed in me by the de Rolos. (Lawful)
2 | Militarization. Everyone should have access to the most powerful weapons available, so they can defend themselves effectively. (Evil)
3 | Cooperation. Any problem can be solved as long as people are willing to work together. (Good)
4 | Camaraderie. It's important to have people you can trust to help out in a fight—and to uncork a bottle together afterward. (Any)
5 | Context. There are no universal rights or wrongs. Every choice depends on the details of the situation. (Chaotic)
6 | Secrecy. Information is valuable, but it can also be dangerous. I'll keep my mouth shut and gather as much intel as I can. (Neutral)

d6 | Bond
1 | I never knew what to do with myself until I joined the Rifle Corps. Now I have a purpose and comrades to give me direction.
2 | One of my fellow Rifle Corps soldiers saved my life—and then I saved theirs. That kind of bond lasts forever.
3 | Whitestone is the best city in all of Tal'Dorei. Nowhere else has been blessed by the Dawnfather and has a clock that tracks the movement of the stars!
4 | My quick thinking saved a noble from assassination, and she showed me great kindness in return. I daren't say it, but I'm more loyal to her than I am to the de Rolos.
5 | My weapon is my life. I clean it, repair it, and care for it—and it serves me loyally in return.
6 | The people of Whitestone cared for my family when we had nothing. I promise to repay their compassion with my service.

d6 | Flaw
1 | Who cares about keeping this gun safe? "Don't let it fall into the wrong hands!" Ha! It's only a matter of time before someone slips up and these weapons are everywhere.
2 | I think being part of the Rifle Corps is so cool. I love telling people about my position so I can impress them.
3 | My weapon was stolen. I built a new one, but I can't return home until I've tracked down the thief and recovered the original.
4 | I'm tired of protecting spoiled people who don't know how to protect themselves.
5 | I shoot first and ask questions later.
6 | The first and only time I killed someone, it changed my life. I still dream about it, and I'll never be the carefree person I was before.</text>
