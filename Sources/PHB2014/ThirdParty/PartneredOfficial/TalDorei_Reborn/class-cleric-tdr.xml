        <name>Divine Domain: Blood Domain</name>
        <text>Developed in Wildemount by the Claret Orders, the Blood Domain centers around the understanding of the natural life force as it exists within the body, and the divine conduit it can become. Those who take up this domain understand that the power of blood is the power of sacrifice, the balance of life and death, and the spirit's anchor within the mortal shell.
	Gods who grant the power of the Blood Domain, including the Ruiner and the Matron of Ravens, direct their followers to tap into the connection between body and soul, exploit the hidden reserves of will within one's own vitality, and corrupt the bodies of others through the secret rites of hemocraft. Clerics of good gods use hemocraft to fill their self-sacrifice with purpose and power, while clerics with fewer morals use the blood of others to achieve their own malevolent ends.

Domain Spells:
At each indicated cleric level, add the listed spells to your spells prepared. They do not count towards your limit.

Blood Domain Spells:
Cleric Level | Spells
1 | false life, sleep
3 | hold person, ray of enfeeblement
5 | haste, slow
7 | blight, stoneskin
9 | dominate person, hold monster

        <name>Bloodletting Focus (Blood Domain)</name>
        <text>Starting at 1st level, your divine magic draws the blood from magically inflicted wounds, worsening the agony of your foes. When you cast a damage-dealing spell of 1st level or higher whose duration is instantaneous, any creature with blood that takes damage from the spell takes extra necrotic damage equal to 2 + the spell's level.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Channel Divinity: Crimson Bond (Blood Domain)</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to form a supernatural bond with a creature you can see, or with a creature for which you possess a blood sample. This bond lasts for 1 hour or until your concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell).
	While the bond is in effect, you can use an action to learn the target's approximate distance and direction from you, as well as its current hit points and any conditions affecting it, as long as the target is within 10 miles of you. Alternatively, you can use your action to attempt to connect with the target's senses. You take 2d6 necrotic damage and the target makes a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a successful save, the bond ends. On a failure, you can choose to either see or hear through the target's senses for a number of minutes equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 minute). During this time, you are blinded or deafened (respectively) with regard to your own senses. When the connection ends, the bond is lost.
	Regardless of the outcome, the target feels a wave of unease pass over it when it makes this save.

        <name>Channel Divinity: Blood Puppet (Blood Domain)</name>
        <text>Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to briefly control a creature's actions—whether that creature is living or dead.
	As an action, you target a Large or smaller creature or corpse within 60 feet of you that has blood. A creature you target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or become charmed by you. An unconscious creature automatically fails its saving throw, and isn't incapacitated while you control its actions. A corpse targeted by this effect gains a semblance of life that you control.
	On the affected creature or animated corpse's turn, you can command it (no action required) to move up to half its speed and use its action to do one of the following:

	• Interact with an object
	• Make a single attack
	• Do nothing

An animated corpse or an unconscious creature takes its turn immediately after yours, but can't move or take actions unless you command it to do so. Its statistics are the same as when it was alive or conscious.
	An affected living creature makes a new saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. For any target, your control lasts for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell).
	At 17th level, you can use this feature to target a Huge or smaller creature or corpse.

        <name>Sanguine Recall (Blood Domain)</name>
        <text>At 6th level, you can sacrifice a portion of your own vitality to recover expended spell slots as an action. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to or less than half your cleric level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You take 1d8 necrotic damage for each spell slot level recovered, which can't be reduced in any way. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.
	For example, if you're an 8th-level cleric, you can recover up to four levels of spell slots—a single 4th-level slot, two 2nd-level slots, a 3rd-level slot and a 1st-level slot, or four 1st-level slots. You then take 4d8 necrotic damage.

        <text>At 8th level, you gain the ability to cause the physical wounds you deal out to bleed profusely. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

        <text>At 17th level, you can use your action to emit a deathly aura of necrotic energy that causes the veins of nearby foes to burst and bleed. For 1 minute, any hostile creature with blood that moves within 30 feet of you for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 3d6 necrotic damage. If a hostile creature with blood regains hit points while in the aura, it regains only half as many hit points as expected.
	Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

    <autolevel level="1">
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Divine Domain: Moon Domain</name>
        <text>Since the Founding, all mortal creatures have looked to the skies and sensed the power and mystery carried by Catha and Ruidus, the two moons of Exandria. The Moonweaver herself is said to guide her worshipers from within the pale glow of Catha, revealing hidden paths and granting inspired dreams to those who pray to that moon. Distant, dark Ruidus is often regarded with awe and apprehension, considered a portent for fell deeds and bad luck.
	Clerics of the Moon Domain draw on their divine connection to the moons to wield light and shadow, invoke good fortune and ill favor, and reveal or conceal as they see fit. Most Moon clerics worship the Moonweaver herself, but her followers are as varied as the stars in the sky. Some seek to protect the vulnerable and do good in the world, while others meddle with impunity and distort the truth for selfish gain. Other Moon clerics worship not the gods but the moons themselves, especially those with an innate connection to the lunar cycles through lycanthropy.

Domain Spells:
At each indicated cleric level, add the listed spells to your spells prepared. They do not count towards your limit.

Moon Domain Spells:
Cleric Level | Spells
1 | faerie fire, silent image
3 | invisibility, moonbeam
5 | hypnotic pattern, major image
7 | greater invisibility, hallucinatory terrain
9 | dream, passwall

        <text>When you choose this domain at 1st level, you learn to shine light upon the mind's most dire moments, shielding those you protect. When a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see makes a Wisdom saving throw, you can use your reaction to grant that creature advantage on the save.
	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

        <name>Channel Divinity: Blessing of the Full Moon (Moon Domain)</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to infuse your allies with bestial power. As an action, you instill a willing creature of your choice within 30 feet of you that you can see with one of the following blessings of your choice:

Blessing of the Watchful Moon. For 1 hour, the blessed creature's speed increases by 10 feet, and it has advantage on Wisdom (Perception or Survival) checks involving smell or made to track a creature.

Blessing of the Blood-Drenched Moon. For 10 minutes, the blessed creature has advantage on attack rolls against a target if at least one of the blessed creature's allies is within 5 feet of the target and the ally isn't incapacitated.

        <text>Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to invoke the twofold arcana of Exandria's moons. By expending one use of Channel Divinity, you can cast a second concentration spell while already concentrating on a first spell, as long as both spells are on your list of Moon Domain spells. If you need to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration on both spells, you make the save with disadvantage. On a failure, you lose concentration on both spells.

        <name>Eclipse of Ill Omen (Moon Domain)</name>
        <text>At 17th level, you can call upon the vermillion moon Ruidus to flare in the sky above you, eclipsing all other light. Its power surrounds you even where the sky can't be seen, and even on other planes. As a bonus action, you can manifest an area of reddish, dim light in a 60-foot radius around you. In addition to the normal effects of dim light, creatures in the area make saving throws with disadvantage. When you create this eclipse, you can choose any number of creatures that are unaffected by it.
	This eclipse lasts while you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell) for up to 1 minute. Concentrating on this feature counts as concentrating on a Moon Domain spell for the purpose of your Mind of Two Moons feature.
	Additionally, once per turn when you deal radiant damage to any creatures in this area of dim light, you can curse one of those creatures until the eclipse ends (no action required). A creature cursed in this way has its speed halved and can't regain hit points.
	Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
