    <text>A hoopak is a sturdy stick with a sling at one end and a pointed tip at the other.

You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When this weapon reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the creature doesn't die. Instead, infernal runes appear as if carved into their flesh and they're healed to 1 hit point. They now have the paralyzed condition until the condition is removed by a Lesser Restoration spell or similar magic. When the condition is removed, the runes disappear. At the start of each of their turns while they're paralyzed, the creature suffers immense pain and gains a level of exhaustion.

Special: When you make a melee attack with this weapon, you ignore its ammunition property. You can use the hoopak as a martial ranged weapon. If you do, it uses the ammunition property, uses sling bullets, and deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage on a hit.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.
