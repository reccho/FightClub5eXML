    <description>Ramius Dangremond is the commander of the Hellriders of Elturel. He never wanted the position, but because of the many deaths within the ranks of the order, he had to step up. His friend and fellow Hellrider, Barachiel, was the main reason he was able to grow into a capable commander. The loss of his friend saddens Ramius, and the news of his imprisonment within the Nine Hells gnaws at his soul.

Ramius is a natural horseman and a gifted athlete. The soldiers he leads often say that there isn't any- thing that Ramius can't mount or ride. He's ridden horses, mammoths, and machines into battle. Loyalty, honor, and duty are virtues that Ramius upholds. He fears nothing other than losing those he cares for.

Ramius as a Contact:
Ramius doesn't have the personal ability to cast Plane Shift—instead, he has been given a magic item that allows him to visit with the party every few days. When he arrives, he brings general supplies such as food and water, and treats any wounds, curses, or diseases the party has (to the best of his ability). Afterwards, he offers a selection of useful magic items for purchase, or, if the party already has excess magic items, he offers to purchase them for keeping or disposal.

      <text>Zagum chooses a point he can see within 90 feet of him. All creatures within a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw. Creatures that fail the save are confused for up to 1 minute and must roll a d10 at the start of each of their turns.

On a 1, a creature moves in a random direction then ends their turn. On a 2-6, a creature can't use actions this turn. On a 7-8, a creature must use their action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within their reach that is not a Fiend. On a 9-10, a creature can move and act normally.

A confused creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on a success.</text>

      <text>The ayperobo swarm makes a Bite attack. On a hit, the swarm burrows inside the creature, dealing an additional 35 (10d6) necrotic damage and taking control of the creature. At the start of each of its turns, the target may make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, expelling the ayperobo swarm and taking 14 (4d6) piercing damage on a success.

While burrowed inside a creature, the ayperobo swarm has total cover against attacks targeting them, and no longer acts on their own initiative. Instead, they take total control over their host, gaining all of its abilities, attacks, and equipment.

They act during the host's turn, taking actions based on their host. If a host dies while the ayperobo swarm is burrowed, they leave the host at the end of the host's turn, rolling initiative if necessary. Creatures acting as hosts to the ayperobo swarm are fully aware of their actions and surroundings, but are incapable of physically operating their body.</text>

      <text>On a hit, the creature takes an additional 32 (5d12) slashing damage as the wings merge with it. While merged, the creature moves with the shredwing, takes 19 (3d12) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turn, and has the grappled condition. The shredwing can unmerge at any time, leaving the creature and dropping it if airborne. The only other way to end the merge is to kill the shredwing.

If the merged creature dies while merged, the shredwing permanently takes over its body. It gains the merged creature's hit dice, natural armor, possessions, and languages. If any of the merged creature's statistics are higher than the shredwing, it inherits those statistics as well. A creature permanently merged by the shredwing can only be resurrected through a Wish spell or similar.</text>

      <text>The oneirovore manipulates the perception of nearby creatures, sending them into a panic. Creatures of the oneirovore's choice that it can see within 60 feet must make a DC 19 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has the charmed condition, their vision distorted such that they view their allies as creatures of pure fear and hatred. While charmed, a creature will use their actions to attack their allies with intent to kill. A charmed creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of each turn, ending the effect on a success.</text>

Creatures that are not Fiends that are within 120 feet of the oneirovore must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 55 (10d10) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Any lesser devils within a 1-mile-radius, centered on the oneirovore, are required by contract to come to its aid upon hearing its Warning Cry. Higher ranking devils may investigate if they desire, but the call holds no magical sway over them.</text>
