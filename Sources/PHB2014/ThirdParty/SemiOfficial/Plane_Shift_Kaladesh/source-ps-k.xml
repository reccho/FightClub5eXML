  <description>The latest crossover between Magic: the Gathering and D&amp;D visits the world of Kaladesh—a living work of art owing its bright existence to the tangible presence of aether.

"Welcome, one and all! Right this way! Open your eyes, your ears, and your imaginations to the wonders of the Inventors' Fair!"

—Herald of the Inventors' Fair

If the optimism, innovation, and spirit of creativity pervading the world of Kaladesh kindled your drive for adventure, we have what you're looking for. If The Art of Magic: The Gathering—Kaladesh made you long to experience the aether-swept landscapes and brilliant inventions of Magic's latest plane for yourself, these pages have what you need. Like a renegade inventor tinkering in a secluded workshop, author James Wyatt has crafted a set of rules to bring your Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventures to life on Kaladesh, including new races, new monsters, and a distinctly aether-flavored take on crafting the marvelous and ingenious magic items that define this plane.

The game mechanics in this supplement are usable in your D&amp;D campaign but are not fully tempered by playtests and design iterations. For these reasons, material in this supplement is not legal in D&amp;D Organized Play events.</description>
