      <text>Bullywugs are medium-sized, frog-like humanoids with wet skin, strong legs, and the ability to breathe underwater.

Cave bullywugs have made their home in the deep places underground. They tend to be dark brown, olive green, light blue or even pigment-free albinos. Their eyes are pale in color, and their eyesight is adapted to the complete lack of sunlight in underground living. They are excellent scavengers and can survive on meager resources.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Social Structure</name>
      <text>Bullywug civilizations have a loose class system organized within a tribe-like framework. Warriors, gatherers, tadpole caretakers, shaman, and builders are typical classes in a bullywug society. They are governed by a king or queen, who is usually the largest and strongest of the warrior caste. The royalty rules according to their attitude and morality, which can range from a friendly monarchy to a hostile dictatorship.

There are a few bullywug towns that are more advanced; some boasting studies in mathematics, physics, metalworking, and engineering. There are even rumors of a few bullywug castles guarded by heavily armored knights. Wealthy kings and queens are waited on by servants and peasants, following more feudalistic-like social organization.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Adaptions</name>
      <text>Bullywugs survive in many different living conditions: untamed jungles, lush forests, wetlands, and even deep underground. As such, their bodies have also adapted to suit these conditions, producing an incredible amount of variety in size, color, and ability.

Bullywugs usually thrive near water. Their strong legs and long, webbed feet make them wonderful swimmers, but hinder their movement on land. They developed their ability to jump as a result, so they can chase down their quarry, or escape a predator.

Bullywugs can pass air through their throats, filling a flexible membrane that bellows out and amplifies their noise. They can speak with one another up to 500 feet away.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Reasons to Adventure</name>
      <text>Greed is the compelling reason to adventure. A clanless bullywug feels free to take for themselves, instead of for a king or queen. Initially, their hunger for the accumulation of wealth is ravenous. As they become used to their freedom, this can dissipate. However, some set out to find treasure for their ruler, in the hopes of achieving a higher social rank on their return.

The quest for power is a hallmark of the bullywug social order. Finding power in personal strength, wealth, or magical ability fits in nicely with bullywug aspirations.

There are a few "free thinking" bullywugs who adventure for other reasons, such as giving money to charity, defending friends or their town, or overthrowing local evil.</text>
