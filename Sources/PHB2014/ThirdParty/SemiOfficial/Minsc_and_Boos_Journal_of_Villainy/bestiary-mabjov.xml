      <text>If a creature says Bodhi Irenicus's full name 9 times in a row, Bodhi hears her name and becomes aware of the creature.

This power works even if the creature is on a different plane of existence. 1 minute after teleporting, Bodhi will teleport back to where she was located when she heard her name spoken.

If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into Bodhi's heart while she is incapacitated in her resting place, Bodhi Irenicus the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.

      <text>Boo is a miniature giant space hamster and has the statistics of a rat. As a bonus action, Minsc can talk to Boo and gain the inspiration to go into a berserker fury. While in this berserking fury Minsc gains the following advantages:

	• Minsc has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

	• Minsc gains a +4 bonus to the damage rolls when using a melee weapon.

	• Minsc has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. 	• Minsc can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of his turns.

	• Minsc can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If Minsc is charmed or frightened when he enters his berserking fury, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.

	• If Minsc drops to 0 hit points while in a berserking fury and doesn't die outright, he can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If he succeeds, he drops to 1 hit point instead. Each time he uses this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. After 24 hours, the DC resets to 10.</text>
