  <description>Five deadly Trials await every initiate on the plane of Amonkhet.

Can you enter the Trials and prove yourself worthy of a place in the God-Pharaoh's afterlife? Perhaps you will take on the role of a vizier, serving the gods and maintaining the social order of Naktamun. Or will you become a dissenter, turning against the city, the gods, and the will of the God-Pharaoh?

If The Art of "Magic: The Gatheringâ€”Amonkhet" sparked your interest in the wasted desert and thriving city of this plane, you can experience it yourself in these pages. Author James Wyatt leads the way through the Trials of the five gods with a set of rules to bring your Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventures to life in Amonkhet, including new races, new monsters, new backgrounds, and cleric domains for each of the five gods.

The game mechanics in this supplement are usable in your D&amp;D campaign but are not fully tempered by playtests and design iterations. For these reasons, material in this supplement is not legal in D&amp;D Organized Play events.</description>
