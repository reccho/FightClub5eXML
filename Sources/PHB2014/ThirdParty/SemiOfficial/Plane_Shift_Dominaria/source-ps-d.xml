  <description>Welcome to Dominaria, an enormous plane with numerous landmasses separated by vast oceans.

With a focus on the continent of Aerona and its surrounding lands (collectively known as the Domains), we hope you enjoy this setting of high fantasy with information on some of the most iconic locations and peoples of Magic: the Gathering like Benalia, Keld, Vodalia, and Llanowar.

The game mechanics in this supplement are usable in your D&amp;D campaign but are not fully tempered by playtests and design iterations. For these reasons, material in this supplement is not legal in D&amp;D Organized Play events.</description>
