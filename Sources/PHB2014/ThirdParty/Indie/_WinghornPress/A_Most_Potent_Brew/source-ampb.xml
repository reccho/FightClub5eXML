Delve your very first dungeon beneath the Wizard's Tower Brewery

The party is sent to deal with a problem that should be instantly familiar to all rookie adventurers â€“ exterminating giant rats that have taken up residence in a beer cellar.
However, if they are to achieve their goal our heroes are going to have to get their first taste of a real dungeon as they explore the ruins of an ancient Wizard's Tower.</description>
