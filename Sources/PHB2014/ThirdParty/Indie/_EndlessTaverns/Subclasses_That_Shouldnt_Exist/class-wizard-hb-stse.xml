        <name>Just In Time (School of Procrastimancy (HB))</name>
        <text>Upon reaching 2nd level, School of Procrastimancy Wizards gain a unique mastery over the timing of their spells.
	When you ready a spell with the Ready action, you no longer need to specify a trigger for the spell's release. Instead, you can choose to release the spell at any point before the start of your next turn as a reaction.
	If you ready a spell and do not release it before the start of your next turn, the spell slot used to cast the spell is regained.
	You can maintain concentration on a spell readied with the Ready action without it counting against your ability to concentrate on another spell. This effectively allows you to concentrate on two spells simultaneously, as long as one is a spell you have readied and not yet released. However, once you release the readied spell, normal concentration rules apply, and you must choose which spell to maintain concentration on if both require it.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Chronic Lateness (School of Procrastimancy (HB))</name>
        <text>At 2nd level, Procrastimancy wizards display their peculiar timing by bending the moment of their engagement in combat. Upon rolling initiative at the start of combat, instead of taking your place in the turn order as usual, you temporarily step into a pocket dimension. While in this pocket dimension, you observe the unfolding combat without being able to affect it or be affected by it in any way.
	At the end of the first round of combat, you re-emerge onto the battlefield within 10 feet of where you would have been, taking your turn immediately. You then return to your place in the turn order as usual.
	When you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you take a long rest.

        <name>Tomorrow's Problem (School of Procrastimancy (HB))</name>
        <text>At 6th level, you gain the ability to push the effects of certain conditions affecting you into the future. Once per long rest, when you fail a saving throw that would impose a condition (such as petrified, poisoned, frightened, or paralyzed), you can postpone the condition's effects. The condition takes hold at the end of your next long rest, but you have advantage on any saving throws to end the condition when it finally manifests.
	At level 14, you postpone the condition indefinitely.

        <name>Procrastinator's Refuge (School of Procrastimancy (HB))</name>
        <text>At 10th level, you gain the extraordinary ability to take a short rest in your pocket dimension. As an action, you can enter a personal sanctuary located in a pocket dimension to take a short rest, returning at a position within 10 feet of where you left at the start of your next turn. This dimension operates on a different timescale, allowing you to take a short rest, and reorganize your spellbook. During this short rest, you can prepare a new set of spells, changing a number of spells equal to your Intelligence modifier.

        <name>Deferred Demise (School of Procrastimancy (HB))</name>
        <text>At 14th level, you've mastered the art of delaying the inevitable to such an extend that you can postpone your own death. Once per long rest, when you would be reduced to 0 hit points or killed outright, you can choose to delay the effect for 24 hours. During this period, you appear and function as normal and gain 1 hit point. When the time expires, you must take a long rest immediately or suffer the delayed consequences.
