    <name>Blood Curse: Blood Curse of the Draining Cloud (HB)</name>
    <level>0</level>
    <classes>Blood Curses</classes>
    <text>Prerequisite: Order of the Mosquito

As a bonus action, you can mark one creature you can see within 30 feet of you to become the nexus of a life-draining swarm for the duration of the curse. The first time the marked creature deals damage with an attack, the attack inflicts additional Necrotic damage equal to your Hemocraft die roll. Simultaneously, you regain hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.

Amplify: When you choose to amplify this blood curse, the creature gains vulnerability to necrotic damage for the duration of the curse. Additionally, the radius of the draining swarm's influence expands to 10 feet around the cursed target. The amplified curse concludes when any creature takes necrotic damage from the Draining Cloud.

    <name>Blood Curse: Blood Curse of the Mosqo (HB)</name>
    <level>0</level>
    <classes>Blood Curses</classes>
    <text>Prerequisite: 15th level, Order of the Mosquito

As a bonus action, you can target one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. A giant spectral mosquito attaches itself to the target, causing it to have disadvantage on attack rolls against anyone except you. Furthermore, any damage the cursed creature takes heals the attacker by an amount equal to half of the damage dealt.
	The curse lasts until the end of your next turn.

Amplify: When you amplify this blood curse, the spectral mosquito drains the very essence of the target. After the curse ends, the target suffers one level of exhaustion as a result of the draining torment.
