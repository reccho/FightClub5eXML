        <name>Monastic Tradition: Way of the Peaceful Nap (HB)</name>
        <text>Peaceful Nap Monks weave the restorative power of sleep into the martial discipline of the monk, allowing practitioners to harness their dreams and slumber for both defence and exploration. These monks blur the line between the waking world and the dreamscape, using their unique abilities to gain insights, protect themselves, and even transport their consciousness to the astral plane.

        <name>Lucid Dreamwalker (Way of the Peaceful Nap (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, your mastery over your dreams grants you the ability to embark on ethereal voyages. During a short or long rest, you can enter a lucid dream state, enabling your consciousness to revisit any location you have physically been to within the last 8 hours. While in this state, you perceive the environment as if you were actually there, using your senses of sight, hearing and smell, but you cannot interact with or alter the environment in any way. This spectral journey leaves no trace in the physical world.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Slumbering Fury (Way of the Peaceful Nap (HB))</name>
        <text>At 3rd Level, you learn to fight even in a state resembling sleep. Upon activating this state as a bonus action, you gain the following benefits:

	• You gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier as well as blindsight up to 10 feet.

	• You have advantage on your first attack on each of your turns.

	• You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical attacks.

If you lose all temporary hit points granted by this feature, you can spend 2 ki points as a reaction to regain them, prolonging your slumber. Otherwise this feature ends and you become cranky, gaining a bonus to your AC equal to your Wisdom modifier until the end of your next turn.
	When you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you take a short rest.

        <name>Dream Strike (Way of the Peaceful Nap (HB))</name>
        <text>At 6th level, your strikes carry the weight of dreams, capable of sending foes into a deep slumber. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 2 ki points to force the target to make a Wisdom saving throw or fall unconscious until the end of their next turn, or if the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. If you are in your Slumbering Fury state, the target has disadvantage on this saving throw.

        <name>Napper's Evasion (Way of the Peaceful Nap (HB))</name>
        <text>By 11th level, your mastery over your nap state allows you to dodge attacks and spells as if phasing in and out of a dream. When you are hit by an attack or fail a dexterity saving throw, you can use your reaction to spend 1 ki point and enter a brief nap state, causing the attack to miss or the effect to fail. You can then reposition yourself up to 10 feet away without provoking attacks of opportunity.
	When you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you take a short rest.

        <text>Upon reaching 17th level, your understanding of the dream state and the astral plane has deepened to the point where you can freely project your astral form without the need for material components. During a short or long rest, you gain the ability to cast Astral Projection for half of your sleeping time, without needing the costly material components typically required for the spell.
