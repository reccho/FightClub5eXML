        <name>Magical Cookbook (Baker (HB))</name>
        <text>At 3rd level, you create a Magical Cookbook that acts as your spellcasting focus. It can transform into a cooking vessel to prepare meals and spells. You can cast ritual spells without preparing them.

Mise en Place. You start with a number of Mise en Place equal to your proficiency bonus. This number doubles at 9th level and triples at 15th level.

Baking Spells. You can cast a spell as a 10-minute ritual using Mise en Place per spell level. After baking, the spell can be released within the next 24 hours as a bonus action. After casting, the spell creates a treat that can be eaten as a bonus action, granting temporary hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier. Your cookbook can only bake one spell at a time.
