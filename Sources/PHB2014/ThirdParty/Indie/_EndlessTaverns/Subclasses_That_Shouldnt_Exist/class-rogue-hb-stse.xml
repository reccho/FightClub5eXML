        <name>Roguish Archetype: Awkward Silence (HB)</name>
        <text>These rogues thrive on their failures in social interactions, leveraging every stumble, stutter and faux pas to gain the upper hand against their foes. From causing distractions with cringe-worthy attempts at conversation to invoking an eerie silence with their mere presence, they navigate the battlefield in a uniquely disconcerting manner. At the pinnacle of their abilities, their most uncomfortable moments can paralyze enemies, not with fear, but with overwhelming second-hand embarrassment.

        <name>Uncomfortable Presence (Awkward Silence (HB))</name>
        <text>At 3rd level, your lack of social grace becomes a weapon. When you attempt a Charisma check and fail, you can choose one creature within 60 feet. That creature is so taken aback by your awkwardness that your next attack against it has advantage.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Misunderstood Genius (Awkward Silence (HB))</name>
        <text>Also at 3rd level, your misunderstood attempts at communication sometimes yield unexpected insights. Whenever you fail a Wisdom or Intelligence check by 5 or more, you stumble upon a clue or piece of information not directly related to your original query. The DM decides what you find, but it should be of comparable value to the information you sought.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Cringe-Worthy Distraction (Awkward Silence (HB))</name>
        <text>At 9th level, your ability to create awkward situations becomes a tactical asset. You can deliberately fail a Charisma check to create a distraction. Each enemy within 30 feet that can see or hear you must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or be so bewildered by your action that they cannot take reactions or bonus actions until the end of your next turn. You may use this feature once per short or long rest or if you critically fail a Charisma check.

        <name>Awkward Silence (Awkward Silence (HB))</name>
        <text>Beginning at 13th level, your failed social interactions can lead to a moment of eerie silence. When you fail a Charisma check, you can cast the Silence spell as a reaction. You may use this feature once per short or long rest or if you critically fail a Charisma check.

        <text>At 17th level, the memory of your most awkward interactions haunts your foes. Whenever you use your Awkward Silence feature, enemies within the zone have disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws.
	Additionally, any enemies who attempt to leave the Awkward Silence must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or be paralyzed with second hand embarrassment until the end of their next turn.
