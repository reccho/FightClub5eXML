        <text>These bards harness the chaotic energy of the culture around them, weaving their ephemeral nature into their magic and performances. They are masters of parody and mimicry, using their deep understanding of memes to distract, confuse, and influence those around them. With a repertoire that includes everything from classic dad jokes to the latest viral memes, these bards bring a unique and modern twist to the ancient art of storytelling.

        <name>Viral Influence (College of Memes (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, your understanding of memes allows you to spread your Bardic Inspiration like a captivating internet trend. When a creature uses one of your Bardic Inspiration dice within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to grant you or an ally within 30 feet temporary hit points equal to the total rolled on the dice.

        <text>Also at 3rd level, you gain the ability to channel the transformative power of memes into your magical performances. When making a Charisma check, you can cast Disguise Self without expending a spell slot, potentially gaining advantage on the check.

        <name>Echo Chamber (College of Memes (HB))</name>
        <text>At 6th level, you can create an area resonant with the echoes of meme culture. As an action, you create a 30-foot radius sphere at a point you choose within 30 feet. Within this sphere, you have advantage on Charisma checks, and any creature that uses a Bardic Inspiration die you've given them rolls the die twice, adding both numbers together. The effect lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it as a bonus action and recharges on a short rest.

        <name>Meme Mirage (College of Memes (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 14th level, your mastery over meme magic allows you to project a grand illusion of chaotic and distracting meme imagery. As an action, you envelop a 60 foot radius centered on yourself in a Meme Mirage. Enemies within the area have disadvantage on attack rolls, and attacks against them have advantage. At the end of each of their turns, affected enemies can attempt an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC to dispel the illusion and end the effect on themselves. Enemies have disadvantage on this saving throw if they find themselves in an Echo Chamber. This feature can be used once per long rest.
