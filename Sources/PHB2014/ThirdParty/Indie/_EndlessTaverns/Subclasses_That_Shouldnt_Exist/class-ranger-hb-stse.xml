        <name>Party Planning Committee (Party Planner Conclave (HB))</name>
        <text>Beginning at 3rd level, you can spend 1 hour with your familiar at the end of a long or short rest planning for a specific type of encounter (combat, social, or exploration). Once planning is completed, for the next 24 hours, you and your allies gain advantage on the first skill check, attack roll, or saving throw made in relation to the planned encounter type.
	Additionally, your familiar can hold concentration on a ritual you cast together, allowing you to benefit from its effects without maintaining concentration yourself. Your familiar must make concentration saving throws and will lose concentration if destroyed or dismissed.
