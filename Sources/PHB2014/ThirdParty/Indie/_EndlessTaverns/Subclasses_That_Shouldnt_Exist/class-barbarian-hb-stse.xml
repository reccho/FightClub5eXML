        <text>At 6th level, your voice booms with ancestral power, echoing on the battlefield.

        <name>Primal Scream (Path of Karaoke (HB))</name>
        <text>By 10th level, your voice can unleash a primal scream in response to pain. As a reaction when you take damage, you can emit a Scream of the Banshee. Enemies within a 15-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once), regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

        <name>Encore (Path of Karaoke (HB))</name>
        <text>At 14th level, your climactic performances can invoke an Encore, pushing you beyond your limits. When you reduce an enemy to 0 hit points, you can immediately use your Stage Presence feature without expending a use of it.
	Additionally, once per long rest, after an Encore, you gain resistance to all damage except Psychic for 1 minute, as your performance encapsulates you in a protective aura of sound and fury.
