        <name>Druid Circle: Circle of the Persistent Weed (HB)</name>
        <text>The Circle of the Persistent Weed Druid champions the relentless and enduring spirit of nature, weaving the resilience of weeds into their magic to protect and revitalize allies. Druids of this circle often bear physical marks of their deep connection to nature with wooden limbs or flowers blooming from their skin, and their Wild Shape forms carry distinct, nature-infused alterations. They stand as guardians of growth and rebirth, embodying the cycle of life in the most inhospitable conditions.

        <name>Rooted Vitality (Circle of the Persistent Weed (HB))</name>
        <text>At 2nd level, your connection to the life force of nature's most tenacious plants grants you and your allies enduring vitality. As a bonus action, you can touch one creature and grant it temporary hit points equal to 1d4 + your Wisdom modifier. These temporary hit points increase to 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 10th level, and 1d10 at 14th level. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

        <name>Weed's Ward (Circle of the Persistent Weed (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 6th level, you learn to summon the protective essence of weeds. As a reaction when you or a nearby ally within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can reduce that damage by an amount equal to your druid level + your Wisdom modifier. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, regaining all expended uses after a long rest.

        <name>Indomitable Growth (Circle of the Persistent Weed (HB))</name>
        <text>At 10th level, your affinity with persistent flora allows you to resist and recover from harm. Once per long rest, if you would be reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. For the next minute, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your druid level at the start of each turn.

        <name>Rebirth of the Resilient (Circle of the Persistent Weed (HB))</name>
        <text>By 14th level, you embody the cycle of life and rebirth that defines the most resilient weeds. Once per long rest, you can use an action to draw on the life force of the natural world around you, rejuvenating yourself or a fallen ally within 60 feet. The target regains all lost hit points, and any effects causing them to be blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned are removed. If used on a deceased ally, they return to life with all hit pois restored, provided that they have not been dead for longer than 1 day. Wooden limbs, flowers sprouting from where wounds once were, and other permanent changes manifest, signifying your rebirth.
