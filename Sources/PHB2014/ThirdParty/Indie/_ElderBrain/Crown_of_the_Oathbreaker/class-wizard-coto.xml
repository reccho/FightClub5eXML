        <name>Arcane Tradition: Academic Wizard (HB)</name>
        <text>Academic wizards are highly trained in all forms of schools of magic and are specialized in the methodology and procedures of spellcasting itself. They analyze the structure of spell formulas in great detail to optimize them and to be able to handle them with greater ease than other mages. Their understanding of these basic concepts allows them to interchange spells in a versatile, almost effortless way. Academic wizards are only trained in the Arcane Tower in the kingdom of Aglarion, where they master their trade for long years before leaving the academy.

        <name>Arcane Tradition: Arcane Sentinel (HB)</name>
        <text>Magic is reliable, it is hard to cheat, and is a more convenient tool to safeguard riches or secrets than intelligent guardians or monsters of any kind. Arcane sentinels are abjuration-specialist wizards who focus on magic that wards areas and prevents intrusion. Their spells are more durable, harder to remove, and more deadly when properly placed. Master Bertio Ranberd is the most renowned practitioner of the arcane sentinel school in Aglarion, teaching his secret formulas at his shop and boarding school, the Emporium of Marvelous Rarities.

        <name>Arcane Tradition: School of Shadow (HB)</name>
        <text>The arcane studies of the school of illusions led some specialist mages to discover ways to infuse their spells with shadow material drawn directly from the Shadowrealm. These illusions are tangible, almost real manifestations of their creator's creativity that can physically interact with their surroundings. Most shadow wizards in Aglarion treat their knowledge as a highly kept secret that they rarely teach to others. Many of them have succumbed to the negative influence of the umbral powers they have learned to manifest, turning into bitter, emotionless versions of their former selves.

        <text>Starting at 6th level, you can empower your illusions with quasi-real shadows that deal damage. When you cast a 1st or higher level spell to create the image of an object, creature, or visible phenomenon, you can choose to cast your spell to deal 1d6 psychic damage per spell level every turn to those creatures that are affected by it. Affected creatures can make an Intelligence saving throw to halve the damage. Physical interaction with the image does not reveal it to be an illusion. A creature that successfully disbelieves the image by taking an action to make a successful Intelligence (Investigation) skill check becomes immune to the damage dealt by the spell.

        <text>Starting at 10th level, you can create a barrage of illusory damaging spells formed out of semi-real shadowstuff. As an action, you can choose an evocation spell that deals damage. You cast this spell as an illusion spell using a spell slot equal to the spell level of the chosen spell. Otherwise, the spell works exactly like the original spell. The affected creature must make the saving throws as described in the spell's description. However, a creature affected by a shadow evocation spell must first make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature believes the spell to be real and takes damage from the spell as normal. On a successful save, the creature takes only half damage.

        <name>Shadow Conjuration (School of Shadow (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 14th level, you can create a quasi-real creature made out of shadows. As an action, you can cast the conjure elemental spell without expending a spell slot or material components, but instead of conjuring an elemental, you can create an illusory creature of challenge rating 6 or lower of any type. A creature that uses its action to examine the illusory creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) skill check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusory creature for what it is, the creature can see through the image and takes only half damage from the illusory creature, and has advantage on saving throws and ability checks made against the illusory creature.
