        <name>Sorcerous Origin: Entropist Bloodline (HB)</name>
        <text>You carry the forces of entropy in your bloodline, fueled by the elemental rule of chaos, and are driven to turn all things into their natural and eventual state of nothingness. Most sorcerers who are touched by chaos in this manner embrace the gifts of their blood and find use of their abilities in everyday life, while some strive through fanatical devotion to turn all things to dust, acting as agents of destruction. In either case, the magic that infuses their blood lends itself to combat, and many entropists are experts at breaking down the fortifications of their opponents and denying them healing.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Touch of Entropy (Entropist Bloodline (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 1st level, your touch destroys non-organic matter. If the nonmagical object isn't being worn or carried, you can choose to cause your touch to destroy a Tiny object at 1st level, a Small object at 5th level, a Medium object at 9th level, a Large object at 13th level, and a Huge object at 17th level. If the object is being worn or carried by a creature, the creature can make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC to avoid your touch. If the object touched is a non-magical weapon being carried, it takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. If the object touched is either a nonmagical armor or a nonmagical shield being worn or carried, it takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield that drops to a +0 bonus is destroyed.

        <name>Aura of Entropy (Entropist Bloodline (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 1st level, you emanate an aura of entropy that interferes with the natural order of reality. The radius of your aura is 5 feet at 1st level, but increases to 10 feet at 6th level, 15 feet at 11th level, and 20 feet at 16th level. Within your aura, objects cannot be repaired (ex.: by mending spell). Additionally, all healing effects are hampered by your aura and require a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to function.

        <name>Entropic Damage (Entropist Bloodline (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 6th level, your aura of entropy also dissolves organic flesh. Each creature you choose in your Aura of Entropy must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose a number of hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier at the start of each of its turns. While the creature remains in your aura, its body continues to dissolve, and the creature continues to lose hit points at the start of its turns unless it succeeds on the Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

        <name>Sorcerous Origin: Lycanthropic Bloodline (HB)</name>
        <text>Some descendants of lycanthropes can awaken the power of their ancestors and benefit from the curse that runs in their blood. These individuals become more and more bestial as their dormant heritage slowly awakens, which they sometimes find hard to control. Lycanthropic bloodline sorcerers rely on their newfound natural savagery in combat and benefit from the defensive capabilities of their ancestors.

        <name>Sorcerous Origin: Primordial Energy Savant (HB)</name>
        <text>The bloodline of the ancient primordial elementals runs in only a few creatures on the Material Plane. These creatures are partially composed of the elements that make up the fabric of all worlds, making them less vulnerable to energy effects. Primordial energy savants are conduits of elemental power who can nurture their heritage to an extent where they can freely access all of the elements to imbue their spells. At the peak of their power, the connection of these elemental-infused creatures on the Elemental Planes is so strong that they can tear a gateway to them using their sheer forces of will.
