        <name>Otherworldly Patron: Chaos Wielder (HB)</name>
        <text>Chaos Wielders choose the Elemental Chaos as their patron, allowing them to tap into the raw forces of chaos and manipulate fate itself. In their temperaments, these warlocks often resemble the force they serve they are erratic and sometimes even nihilistic, not bound by any standards of laws or social norms. As a result, Chaos Wielders are usually spurned by the rest of society and are considered dangerous in their seemingly incomprehensible motives.
