    <text>Even if this defies gravity, a creature or unattended item you touch becomes magically fixed in place. A creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Strength saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target. An item immobilized by the spell can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the item to fall. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the fixed item up to 10 feet on a success.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell on an item using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.

    <text>You alter the structure of an object or the body of a creature, which starts to lose its structural integrity or decompose.
	Choose a creature that you can see within range. The target creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 11 (2d10) force damage at the start of its turn and has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.
	Choose an object that you can see within range. This spell destroys a large or smaller nonmagical object in three rounds. If the target is a huge object, this spell causes it to become damaged, or renders it useless if it has a complex mechanism or moving parts. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th.

    <text>You conjure a tent of a magnificent size that lasts for the duration.
	The tent is a large "Big Top" tent with an oval shape of 50 by 75 feet and is open on the sides. The colors and the designs on the canvas are determined by you when you cast the spell. The tent is waterproof and well-fastened to the ground, its magic preventing it from tipping.
	The tent is made of magical canvas, supported by iron poles. The ten supporting poles each have AC 19 and 24 hit points, immunity to damage from non-magical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a wish spell can repair the tent (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of wish causes one column to regain 50 Hit Points.

    <text>A 20-foot-radius sphere of vile-smelling necrotic gas of a green shade magically swirls forth from a point that you choose within range. The gas eats away at the lungs of any creature in the area and creates a particular form of choking zombie from those who die due to the spell. The fog spreads around corners. It lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses the fog, ending the spell. Its area is heavily obscured.
	When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 4d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures are not affected if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe. The fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns, rolling along the surface of the ground. The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings.
	If a creature falls to 0 hit points, it rises as a zombie at the end of the round with the following modification:

	• Choking Strike: The zombie chokes the living, trying to suck the air from the lungs of its victims. Any creature hit by the slam attack of the zombie must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC equals 10 + the zombie's Constitution ability modifier) or gain one level of exhaustion.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.

    <text>The air fills with a melancholic tune, otherworldly and disheartening, emanating from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius centered on that point that hears the melody must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, an affected target becomes frightened for the duration and takes 1d6 psychic damage every round. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target. On a successful save that creature is unaffected and is immune to the effects of the spell for 24 hours.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the emanation increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 4th.

Frightened:
	• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
	• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.

    <text>You can conjure any creature through potent illusions that are partly material. You summon illusory creatures made of shadow material that take form and appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range. Choose one of the following options for what appears:

	• One creature of challenge rating 2 or lower
	• Two creatures of challenge rating 1 or lower
	• Four creatures of challenge rating 1/2 or lower
	• Eight creatures of challenge rating 1/4 or lower

Each shadow creature retains its type, and disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions. The GM has the creatures' statistics.
	When a shadow creature attacks or interacts with a target, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to disbelieve the illusion. On a failed save, the shadow creature deals full damage. On a success, the shadow creature only deals half damage and has half of its total hit points for the rest of the spell's duration.

Before the regular effects of the replicated spell are determined, the target must first succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to disbelieve the illusion. On a failed save, the spell deals full damage. On a success, the spell only deals half damage. The damage type of the spell is determined by the spell being replicated.

On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.
	In addition, a creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw. A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area. The spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target creature is paralyzed for the duration and starts to suffocate as it has run out of breath. This spell has no effect on constructs, plants, undead, or other creatures that don't breathe. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw.

	If you choose its arms, on a failed save, the target creature gains disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks that require the use of an arm. If you cast this spell again on the same creature's arms and the target fails the saving throw a second time while under the effect of the same spell, the target creature loses the function of their arms entirely.
	If you choose a leg, on a failed save, the target creature's movement speed is halved. If you cast this spell again on the same creature's feet and the target fails the saving throw a second time while under the effect of the same spell, the target creature loses the function of their leg and becomes restrained.
