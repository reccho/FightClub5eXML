        <name>Ranger Archetype: Feyfriend (HB)</name>
        <text>Those who venture into the forests deep enough might find crossroads that connect the Feyrealm and the Material Plane. Often, mischievous fey dwell around these planar breaches, and if one can express the right attitude, they can be befriended. The fey respect those who understand their nature and are willing to become life-long allies over time.
	In Aglarion, feyfriend rangers have horrific stories to tell about the recent hardships of the few fey who have fled the Bleak Mire. Even with the crossroads blocked to this domain, the Feyrealm itself still helps these allied rangers upkeep their valued alliances.

        <name>Fey Armament (Feyfriend (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, the fey lords grant you the armament of a sprite. As an action, you can create one of the following weapons in your empty hand:

	• Shortbow of the Sprite: A creature hit by this shortbow must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. If its saving throw result is 5 or lower, the poisoned target falls unconscious for the same duration, or until it takes damage or another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

	• Sword of the Elves: This extremely sharp longsword deals an extra 1d6 slashing damage.

These weapons count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. The weapon disappears after 1 minute, if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 round, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.
	Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

        <text>Starting at 15th level, fey creatures and creatures of the natural world sense your connection to their kind and become hesitant to attack you. When a fey, beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your ranger spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.

        <name>Ranger Archetype: Monster Tamer (HB)</name>
        <text>A ranger with a knack for calming and controlling beasts and creatures with bestial intelligence, the monster tamer has dedicated its life to locating and dealing with such creatures. Usually, monster tamers are called in to handle threats from the wild, but sometimes they are merely essential personnel in keeping large beasts of burden in line. Some monster tamers use their skills to subjugate animals, some to care for them and nourish them in the wild. Their favored enemies are always beasts and monstrosities. In Aglarion, tamers can be found in the countryside or as the caretakers of the Monster Menagerie in Onadbyr.

	• When an attacker that you can see hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you. However your beast or monstrosity ally takes the other half of the damage.

        <name>Ranger Archetype: Siege Beast Master (HB)</name>
        <text>Even the largest of beasts can be subdued and harnessed as siege weapons by a ranger of this enclave. A siege beast's power lies in its sheer size and ability to smash down walls or destroy siege weapons. As a result, they are at the forefront of armies, trampling anything and anyone who crosses their path, often serving as mounts for their ranger companions. Once bonded to a ranger, the siege beast becomes a force of devastation, gaining some magical abilities from its companion.

If you are incapacitated or absent, the beast has free will and protects you and itself. If the beast dies, you can obtain another one by spending 8 hours to befriend another non-hostile beast.
