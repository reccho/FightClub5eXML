        <text>The Dirge Singers was formed from the ancient funeral singers of the Inevitable, the god of Death. These pious servants of the clergy of death were able to project the feelings associated with their chosen faith through songs and poems so powerfully that they could influence the emotions of others and even kill them. The followers of the Inevitable still imitate the secret songs and poems of the original dirge singers, but only the most skilled singers can invoke their true magical powers.
