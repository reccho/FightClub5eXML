    <weight>1</weight>
    <text>The amulet of positive energy contains condensed life essence that can be used to heal or keep undead creatures at bay. As an action, you can speak the command word of the amulet to create an immobile shimmering barrier that extends out from the amulet in a 200-foot radius, hedging out undead creatures. Undead already within the area are unaffected. The barrier lasts until dismissed and prevents undead from passing or reaching through. An affected creature can cast spells or make attacks with ranged or reach weapons through the barrier.
	Once per day as an action, you can also choose a creature within 50 feet. A surge of positive energy washes through the creature, causing it to regain 70 hit points. This effect also ends blindness, deafness, and any disease affecting the target. If you choose a target that is an undead, the target must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 49 (14d6) radiant damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage can't reduce the target's hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the radiant damage dealt. Any effect that removes a disease allows a creature's hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes.
	Additionally, you can break the vial of the amulet to cast the true resurrection spell, and the amulet's magic is lost.

	Additionally, once per day, the wielder of the azure bridge control rod can cast the web spell, which conjures a goo-like substance that is inflammable. Once you use this ability of the rod, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

    <range>5/20</range>
    <text>As an action, you can animate the net and command it to attack a single opponent of up to Large size. It flies towards a creature you can see within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become restrained. A creature hit by the net is restrained until it is freed and suffers 4 (1d4 + 2) points of piercing damage at the start of its turn as long as it remains restrained.
	As a bonus action, you can direct the net to release any creature currently restrained in it and direct it at a new target that is no more than 20 feet away. The net remains animate for 1 minute or until you command it as a bonus action to turn inanimate. It has no effect on creatures that are Huge or larger.
	A creature can use its action to make a DC 16 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 25 slashing damage to the net (AC 16) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. Using the leash attached to the net, you can drag or pull creatures restrained by the net towards you with a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you move while using the net this way, your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.

Special: A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

This weapon is fashioned from infernal iron and traced with veins of hellfire that shed dim light in a 5-foot-radius.
	Any humanoid killed by an attack made with this weapon has its soul funneled into the River Styx, where it's reborn instantly as a lemure devil.

    <text>Ammo: blowgun needle

This vicious-looking blowgun is decorated with fetishes and necrotic runes. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Additionally, you can fire an additional needle each round as a bonus action. If a needle deals damage, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or suffer 7 (2d6) points of necrotic damage as it is wracked with pain.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

This ornately crafted longbow seems like an ordinary weapon until held in darkness when its magical energies awaken. While wielding the bow, you gain darkvision 120 ft. and can even see through magical darkness. You can also cast the darkness spell, but you can't cast the spell again until the next dawn. When you fire an arrow from the bow of the night under cover of darkness, your target gains no benefit from cover other than total cover. If your target is also in darkness, the bow of the night grants advantage on attack rolls made with it and deals an extra 7 (2d6) necrotic damage on each hit. When you have an arrow notched, the bow of the night also reduces all brightly lit areas to dim lit, and dimly lit areas to darkness in a 120 feet radius.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use.

You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

On a roll of 11 or higher, you vanish from your current plane of existence and appear in the Ethereal Plane unless you were already on that plane. At the start of your next turn, or when you remove the cloak on the Ethereal Plane, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space from where you vanished. If no unoccupied space is available within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if more than one space is equally near).
	While on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and hear the plane you originated from, which is cast in shades of gray, and you can't see anything there more than 60 feet away. You can only affect and be affected by other creatures on the Ethereal Plane. Creatures that aren't there can't perceive you or interact with you, unless they have the ability to do so.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>Master Arlen created the crown of Aglarion to symbolize the integrity of the monarchy of Aglarion that was established hundreds of years ago by the first monarch, King Razmyrel Melkar the True. Its powers were designed to serve the first king in his campaign against the zealous Order of the Eternal Light.
The wearer of the crown of Aglarion gains a +1 bonus to ability checks, AC, and saving throws, and can cast the following spells once per day: control weather, move earth, pass wall. The crown of Aglarion is imprevious to all types of damage.
	The wearer of the crown of Aglarion can also create a floating disk that has a 50-foot diameter and can hold up to 20,000 pounds. The wearer of the crown of Aglarion and any other creature can stand on its surface. As an action, the wearer of the crown of Aglarion can move the floating disk with a fly speed of 30 ft. The disk disappears after 1 hour and cannot be recreated until the next dawn.
	In its current state, the crown of Aglarion is cursed and was given vile sentience and personality when the Matrons of Malice bound the horned devil Kalanistophle to it. The devil's soul advises their hagspawn daughters, the triplet Queen Aphinahs, in their rule. It is a lawful evil sentient magic item with an Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma score of 15. It communicates by transmitting emotions to the creature carrying or wearing it. It has hearing and darkvision in a 120 ft. radius. The crown of Aglarion demands its wearer to maintain the rule of the Matrons of Malice over Aglarion, pursuing this goal to the exclusion of all other goals. If the crown's wearer refuses to comply with its wishes, the item can attempt to take control of its wearer. If the crown of Aglarion attempts to take control of its wearer, the wearer must make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the wearer is charmed by the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wearer must try to follow the commands of the crown of Aglarion. If the wearer takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Whether the attempt to control its user succeeds or fails, the crown of Aglarion can't use this power again until the next dawn.
	Once donned, the crown of Aglarion can only be removed after the use of a remove curse spell or similar magic, or if its wearer dies. The curse on the crown of Aglarion can only be removed by all three of the Matrons of Malice, and only if it is laid on a pyre made from the Hagtree where the true heir of the crown is burnt, while the dead King Dasmag plays a melody.

The pommel of the magical longsword is in the shape of a soaring falcon, the crest of House Melkar. The sword was crafted by none other than Master Arlen the Constructor to aid the first king in his battle against the theocracy of the Order of the Eternal Light. As a result, the sword has become a symbol of the kingdom and the person of the Monarch.
	The Falcon Blade has 3 charges and holds magical energies of the highest order that can bend time to the will of its wielder. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While wielding the Falcon Blade, you also gain advantage on Initiative checks and on all attack rolls in the round if you have a higher initiative than the creature you attack with the Falcon Blade. You can expend 1 charge per turn to gain an additional action. This action can only be used to take the attack action with the Falcon Blade. The Falcon Blade regains all of its charges daily at dawn.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>This curved and serrated magical dagger is made in the furnaces in Hell and crafted from steel hardened by blood from the sacrifices of mortals. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. If you use it against a creature with 0 hit points or kill a creature using the dagger, it automatically dies, its soul sent to Hell. Creatures slain in such a manner cannot be brought back to life, except by a spell like resurrection or wish. When killing a creature with an Intelligence score of 6 or more with this weapon, the wielder gains the benefits of an aid spell for 1 hour. When you hit a celestial with it, that target takes an extra 1d8 damage. If a good-aligned creature touches the dagger, it suffers 1d8 necrotic damage at the start of its turn as long as it remains in contact with it.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

	The trebuchet is 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high. Each creature in the area where the trebuchet appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the trebuchet. Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.
	The statuette can become a trebuchet for up to 6 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. The trebuchet reverts to its statuette form at the end of the duration. It reverts to a statuette early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to repeat the command word while touching it.

When you use an action to throw a dose of powder into the air, the true forms of all creatures that are within 10 feet from you are revealed for 1d4 minutes. The duration is the same for all subjects, and the powder is consumed when its magic takes effect. The powder shows the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic into another form. However, it does not force the subjects to revert to their original forms.

The mirror reflects the image of any creature that stands before it, however, the background shows the animated illusion of a crowd of spectators of all races and cultures. The mirror has four command words that create various effects:

"Light" causes the mirror to shed bright light in a 15-foot cone and dim light for an additional 30 feet. It lasts until you use a bonus action to repeat the command word.

"Cheers" causes the mirrors to emit the sounds of cheers and laughter and creates the illusion of the spectators cheering in the background. The cheers last for 1 round.

"Costume" causes the mirror to change the costume of the reflection of any creature that stands in front of it. As a bonus action, you can use the command word to generate a random costume with an infinite number of combinations. Stepping out of the reflection of the mirror ends the effect.

"Stage" causes the mirror to change the reflection of the stage around the reflected creatures. As a bonus action, you can use the command word to generate a random set of stage props with an infinite number of combinations. Stepping out of the reflection of the mirror ends the effect.

    <text>Ammo: sling bullet

This staff sling is usually crafted by shamans of wild tribes, clerics who venerate deities of oozes, or warlocks dedicated to ooze patrons. When you speak a command word, the slinger generates globules of corrosive slime that you can sling at your opponents. The slinger can generate 5 globules per day. After all 5 daily globules have been slung, the sling functions as a regular sling. On a hit, the corrosive slime deals 7 (2d6) points of acid damage, and if the target is wearing nonmagical metal armor, its armor is partly corroded. The target takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to its AC on each hit. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons"). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

    <text>Ammo: crossbow bolt

King Waldrann is famous for mistrusting spellcasters. He has always feared their powers and been cautious when dealing with magic users. The Spellbreaker crossbow was gifted to King Daerios by the neighboring tribe of Vordani barbarians who live high up in the mountains north of Aglarion. The savage tribes revere physical aptitude and despise magic, which they deem as a sin, and eradicate it where they can. The only form of magic their clan chieftains have accepted for centuries was that which could be used against spellcasters. This mighty heavy crossbow was traded to them a century ago by sailors from afar, in exchange for protection of their inland caravan routes. Later, the weapon was given to King Daerios as a reward for helping in defeating the doppeldrake Malzdreziret, otherwise known as the Scaled Impostor. The heavy crossbow deals tremendous pain to those who are able to cast spells or call forth innate magic in any form. The pain is so intensely nerve-racking that most casters immediately fail to concentrate on maintaining their spells.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, while you are attuned to it, the bonus increases to +3 if you use it against a target that has the Spellcasting trait. If you deal damage with the crossbow to a creature that is maintaining concentration on a spell, that creature makes its Constitution saving throw with disadvantage to maintain its spell. Additionally, the crossbow deals an additional 3 (1d6) force damage to creatures with the spellcasting trait.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Proficiency: martial, heavy crossbow

This large steel shield depicts the screaming faces of fey creatures named spriggans that can grow in size from small to large. The shield has 3 charges. You can expend a charge to enlarge your form and anything you are wearing or carrying for 1 minute. While enlarged, your size becomes Large, your damage dice on Strength-based weapon attacks is doubled, you make Strength checks and Strength saving throws with advantage, and you gain a +1 bonus to AC while you wield the shield. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC. If you lack the room to become large, you attain the maximum size possible in the space available. The shield regains 1d3 of its expended charges daily at dawn.

    <weight>1</weight>
    <text>Created by Master Arlen the Constructor at the order of King Razmyrel Melkar the True, the six Torcs of the Tower were crafted to provide a counter to the powers of the magical academy and as a failsafe mechanism so the Arcane Tower could be recalled from the Astral Plane if needed. Each bracelet was entrusted to one of the six founders of the Red Cloak Lawgivers to be arbiters of their rightful use. Over the past centuries, the true function of the torcs has become shrouded in the past. Some have been handed down through the generations, some have become lost, and some have turned up in the hands of those who have no inkling of their true natures.
	The torcs are keyed to one another, and their wearers can sense the direction to a nearby torc of the tower's location, as long as that object is within 1 hex distance in any direction on the map of the Kingdom of Aglarion. If the object is in motion, the wearer knows the direction of its movement.
	The torcs each have unique properties, but they can be used together in conjunction to recall the Arcane Tower to the Material Plane from the Astral plane. This use of the torcs does not require attunement.

Adamantine: Once per day as a reaction, you can activate the torc and gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from attacks that aren't adamantine for 3 rounds.

Mithral: Once per day as a reaction, you can activate the torc to grant you AC. For 3 rounds, your AC can't be less than 21, regardless of what kinds of armor you are wearing.

Silver: Once per day as a reaction, you can activate the torc and gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from attacks that aren't silver for 3 rounds.

Iron: Once per day as a reaction, you can activate the torc and gain fire absorption for 1 round. Whenever you are subjected to fire damage, you take no damage and instead regain a number of hit points equal to the fire damage dealt.

Clay: Once per day as a reaction, you can activate the torc and gain lightning absorption for 1 round. Whenever you are subjected to lightning damage, you take no damage and instead regain a number of hit points equal to the lightning damage dealt.

Stone: Once per day as a reaction, you can activate the torc and gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks for 3 rounds.
