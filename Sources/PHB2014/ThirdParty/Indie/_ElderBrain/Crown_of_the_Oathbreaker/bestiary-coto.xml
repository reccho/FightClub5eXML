    <description>Skeletons arise when animated by dark magic. They heed the summons of spellcasters who call them from their stony tombs and ancient battlefields, or rise of their own accord in places saturated with death and loss, awakened by stirrings of necromantic energy or the presence of corrupting evil.

Animated Dead:
Whatever sinister force awakens a skeleton infuses its bones with a dark vitality, adhering joint to joint and reassembling dismantled limbs. This energy motivates a skeleton to move and think in a rudimentary fashion, though only as a pale imitation of the way it behaved in life. An animated skeleton retains no connection to its past, although resurrecting a skeleton restores it body and soul, banishing the hateful undead spirit that empowers it.

While most skeletons are the animated remains of dead humans and other humanoids, skeletal undead can be created from the bones of other creatures besides humanoids, giving rise to a host of terrifying and unique forms.

Obedient Servants:
Skeletons raised by spell are bound to the will of their creator. They follow orders to the letter, never questioning the tasks their masters give them, regardless of the consequences. Because of their literal interpretation of commands and unwavering obedience, skeletons adapt poorly to changing circumstances. They can't read, speak, emote, or communicate in any way except to nod, shake their heads, or point. Still, skeletons are able to accomplish a variety of relatively complex tasks.

A skeleton can fight with weapons and wear armor, can load and fire a catapult or trebuchet, scale a siege ladder, form a shield wall, or dump boiling oil. However, it must receive careful instructions explaining how such tasks are accomplished.

Although they lack the intellect they possessed in life, skeletons aren't mindless. Rather than break its limbs attempting to batter its way through an iron door, a skeleton tries the handle first. If that doesn't work, it searches for another way through or around the obstacle.

Habitual Behaviors:
Independent skeletons temporarily or permanently free of a master's control sometimes pantomime actions from their past lives, their bones echoing the rote behaviors of their former living selves. The skeleton of a miner might lift a pick and start chipping away at stone walls. The skeleton of a guard might strike up a post at a random doorway. The skeleton of a dragon might lie down on a pile of treasure, while the skeleton of a horse crops grass it can't eat. Left alone in a ballroom, the skeletons of nobles might continue an eternally unfinished dance.

When skeletons encounter living creatures, the necromantic energy that drives them compels them to kill unless they are commanded by their masters to refrain from doing so. They attack without mercy and fight until destroyed, for skeletons possess little sense of self and even less sense of self-preservation.

      <name>Hag Coven</name>
      <text>When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.

A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Hag Eye (Coven Only)</name>
      <text>A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.

A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.</text>

      <name>Innate Spellcasting</name>
      <text>The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

	• At will: dancing lights, minor illusion, vicious mockery</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)</name>
      <text>While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:

	• 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness
	• 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object
	• 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt
	• 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph
	• 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying
	• 6th level (1 slots): eyebite

For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12 + the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4 + the hag's Intelligence modifier.</text>

The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.</text>

    <description>Faces of Evil:
Ancient beings with origins in the Feywild, hags are cankers on the mortal world. Their withered faces are framed by long, frayed hair, horrid moles and warts dot their blotchy skin, and their long, skinny fingers are tipped by claws that can slice open flesh with a touch. Their simple clothes are always tattered and filthy.

All hags possess magical powers, and some have an affinity for spellcasting. They can alter their forms or curse their foes, and their arrogance inspires them to view their magic as a challenge to the magic of the gods, whom they blaspheme at every opportunity.

Hags name themselves in darkly whimsical ways, claiming monikers such as Black Morwen, Peggy Pigknuckle, Grandmother Titchwillow, Nanna Shug, Rotten Ethel, or Auntie Wormtooth.

Monstrous Motherhood:
Hags propagate by snatching and devouring human infants. After stealing a baby from its cradle or its mother's womb, the hag consumes the poor child. A week later, the hag gives birth to a daughter who looks human until her thirteenth birthday, whereupon the child transforms into the spitting image of her hag mother.

Hags sometimes raise the daughters they spawn, creating covens. A hag might also return the child to its grieving parents, only to watch from the shadows as the child grows up to become a horror.

Dark Bargains:
Arrogant to a fault, hags believe themselves to be the most cunning of creatures, and they treat all others as inferior. Even so, a hag is open to dealing with mortals as long as those mortals show the proper respect and deference. Over their long lives, hags accumulate much knowledge of local lore, dark creatures, and magic, which they are pleased to sell.

Hags enjoy watching mortals bring about their own downfall, and a bargain with a hag is always dangerous. The terms of such bargains typically involve demands to compromise principles or give up something dear-especially if the thing lost diminishes or negates the knowledge gained through the bargain.

A Foul Nature:
Hags love the macabre and festoon their garb with dead things and accentuate their appearance with bones, bits of flesh, and filth. They nurture blemishes and pick at wounds to produce weeping, suppurating flesh. Attractive creatures evoke disgust in a hag, which might "help" such creatures by disfiguring or transforming them.

This embrace of the disturbing and unpleasant extends to all aspects of a hag's life. A hag might fly in a magical giant's skull, landing it on a tree shaped to resemble an enormous headless body. Another might travel with a menagerie of monsters and slaves kept in cages, and disguised by illusions to lure unwary creatures close. Hags sharpen their teeth on millstones and spin cloth from the intestines of their victims, reacting with glee to the horror their actions invoke.

Dark Sorority:
Hags maintain contact with each other and share knowledge. Through such contacts, it is likely that any given hag knows of every other hag in existence. Hags don't like each other, but they abide by an ageless code of conduct. Hags announce their presence before crossing into another hag's territory, bring gifts when entering another hag's dwelling, and break no oaths given to other hags-as long as the oath isn't given with the fingers crossed.

Some humanoids make the mistake of thinking that the hags' rules of conduct apply to all creatures. When confronted by such an individual, a hag might find it amusing to string the fool along for a while before teaching it a permanent lesson.

Dark Lairs:
Hags dwell in dark and twisted woods, bleak moors, storm-lashed seacoasts, and gloomy swamps. In time, the landscape around a hag's lair reflects the creature's noxiousness, such that the land itself can attack and kill trespassers. Trees twisted by darkness attack passersby, while vines snake through the undergrowth to snare and drag off creatures one at a time. Foul stinking fogs turn the air to poison, and conceal pools of quicksand and sinkholes that consume unwary wanderers.

Panpipes: The satyr plays its pipes and chooses one of the following magical effects: a charming melody, a frightening strain, or a gentle lullaby. Any creature within 60 feet of the satyr that can hear the pipes must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be affected as described below. Other satyrs and creature that can't be charmed are unaffected
An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to these panpipes for the next 24 hours.

Charming Melody: The creature is charmed by the satyr for 1 minute. If the satyr or any of its companions harms the creature, the effect on it ends immediately.

Frightening Strain: The creature is frightened for 1 minute.

Gentle Lullaby: The creature falls asleep and is unconscious for 1 minute. The effect ends if the creature takes damage or if someone takes an action to shake the creature awake.</text>

    <description>Ettercaps are humanoid spiders that tend, feed, and watch over spiders the way a shepherd oversees a flock of sheep. They lair deep in remote forests.

Fine strands of silk stream from glands in an ettercap's abdomen, letting it shoot sticky strands of webbing to bind, entrap, or strangle its victims. It can also use its webbing to fashion elaborate snares and nets, which often festoon its lair.

Quiet Killers:
When travelers and explorers venture into an ettercap's territory, the ettercap stalks them. Some meet their end wandering blindly into traps or sections of forest enclosed by webs. Others, the ettercap garrotes with strands of web or envenoms with its poisonous bite.

Sylvan Despoilers:
Though they dwell in the wilds, ettercaps have no desire to live in harmony with nature. A forest infested with ettercaps transforms into a gloomy place, choked with webs and infested with giant spiders, giant insects, and other sinister predators. Creatures that wander too far into such a wood are soon lost in a maze of webs that dangle with the bones and lost treasures of the ettercaps' victims.

Enemies of the Fey:
Ettercaps are natural enemies of fey creatures. The foul creatures set web snares to catch sprites and pixies, which they hungrily devour, and will encase a dryad's tree in webbing in a vain attempt to trap the dryad. Otherwise timid fey will sometimes approach outsiders for help in dealing with an ettercap infestation, being ill-equipped to deal with the malevolent creatures themselves.

    <description>Academicians are masters of magic and spell casting techniques unique to the Arcane Tower. They are professors and specialist wizards who continue to optimize spellcasting techniques as set by Master Arlen and the first academicians hundreds of years ago. Rarely, when there is an opening in academic seats, some of the brightest graduating apprentices, distinguished by their mastery and progress in their studies, are offered a position to become an academician of the Arcane Tower.

    <description>Those who wish to study the higher arts of magic have to either find a personal master or apply for apprenticeship at the Arcane Tower, the largest such institution in Aglarion or the Drayl City States. The rigorous admissions process requires a certain level of understanding of magic and eliminates most applicants. Those who are accepted by the academicians can make sure that they have stepped on a path of progress and arcane advancement. An apprentice has already acquired enough knowledge about the special spell methodologies unique to the academy and learned simplified shortcuts to enhance their spellcasting abilities. Apprentices graduate after a minimum of twelve years.

    <description>The astral spider is a formidable predator that roams the Astral Plane in invisibility, searching for rare mates and grounded locations in the void to lay its eggs within invisible strands of spider silk. The spider can shift between the Astral and Material Planes, sometimes venturing to the Material Plane, where prey is more abundant, to hunt or breed. Most astral spiders display vibrant and prismatic hues, which are rarely seen or recounted, as the spider is almost always invisible, and few live to describe an encounter with it.

    <description>The Raider of Hearts, as the succubus fiend is called by those who know of its reputation, is a daring pirate captain who rebelled against its former succubus queen master and broke away from its rule with a dozen of its kind. The renegade succubi and incubi stole one of the flying ships of the succubus queen's armada, the Last Kiss, and escaped to the Astral Plane through a portal Azaeresh discovered earlier. From there, the demonic pirates raid other planes and retreat to deposit their treasures in their secret hideout. Azaeresh is a calculating and self-centered fiend who makes no allowances.

Equipment:
Azaeresh has a mix of gems looted from Master Zaophas' quarters worth 1,000 gold pieces in total. The succubus carries the withered right hand of a witchservant cultist of the Children of the Coven that bears the tattoo of the cult and functions as a wand of magic detection. It was given to Azaeresh as a downpayment from Blister. The fiend pirate captain also has a +1 rapier and a spyglass of devilish revealing in its possession.

Succubi and incubi inhabit all of the Lower Planes, and the lascivious dark-winged fiends can be found in service to devils, demons, night hags, rakshasas, and yugoloths. Asmodeus, ruler of the Nine Hells, uses these fiends to tempt mortals to perform evil acts. The demon lord Graz'zt keeps succubi and incubi as advisers and consorts.

Though legend speaks of them separately, any succubus can become an incubus, and vice versa. Most of these fiends do have a preference for one form or the other. Mortals only rarely see a succubus or incubus in its true form, however, for the fiend typically begins its corruption in veiled, insidious ways.

Beautiful Corrupters:
A succubus or incubus first appears in ethereal form, passing through walls like a ghost to lurk next to a mortal's bedside and whisper forbidden pleasures. Sleeping victims are tempted to give in to their darkest desires, indulge in taboos, and feed forbidden appetites. As the fiend fills the victim's dreams with debauched images, the victim becomes more susceptible to temptation in everyday life.

Inevitably, the fiend enters the mortal realm in tempting form to directly influence a creature's actions. Appearing in the guise of a humanoid who has previously appeared only in the victim's dreams, the succubus or incubus seduces or befriends its victim, indulging all its desires so that it performs evil acts of its own free will.

A mortal bequeaths its soul to the fiend not by formal pledge or contract. Instead, when a succubus or incubus has corrupted a creature completely-some say by causing the victim to commit the three betrayals of thought, word, and deed-the victim's soul belongs to the fiend. The more virtuous the fiend's prey, the longer the corruption takes, but the more rewarding the downfall. After successfully corrupting a victim, the succubus or incubus kills it, and the tainted soul descends into the Lower Planes.

The succubus or incubus resorts to charming a victim magically only when necessary, usually as a form of self-defense. A charmed creature isn't responsible for its actions, so forcing it to behave against its will won't bring the fiend closer to the ultimate prize: the victim's soul.

Deadly Kiss:
The kiss of a succubus or incubus is an echo of the emptiness that is the fiend's longing for a corrupted soul. Likewise, the recipient of the fiend's kiss gains no satisfaction from it, experiencing only pain and the profound emptiness that the fiend imparts. The kiss is nothing short of an attack, usually delivered as a final farewell before the fiend escapes.

Fiendish Offspring:
Succubi and incubi can reproduce with one another to spawn more of their kind. Less commonly, a succubus or incubus reproduces with a humanoid. From this unholy union, a cambion child is conceived. Invariably, the fiendish offspring is as wicked as its fiendish parent.

    <description>Baendretarixus is a young black dragon, a sentient carcass that has retained only the basic hoarding instinct of its proud ancestors. It was killed at a relatively young age for a dragon by three adventurers, who sought out his lair on the Shadowrealm. Baendretarixus has become a new creature since the death bugs have taken over its physical and mental remains. Its sentience is a mix of the original dragon and the body-snatching death bug hive mind. Its undead form has given it eternal life, which it uses to grow its power.

    <description>Bakator lived the life of a duergar raider in the caverns of his people under Vordan until one day, the fortress of the duergar was destroyed by a demonic horde. The demons slaughtered most but left the most resilient defenders alive, only to transport them to the Abyss as slaves. Despite the odds, and thanks to his black heart, Bakator survived and even caught the eye of a servant of Faeryl Myrryn in the soul markets of the Abyss. Led in front of the Blood Queen herself, Bakator swore allegiance to the drow conjurer vampire lord and accepted her blood. Since his transformation into a vampire spawn, Bakator has served Faeryl Myrryn's whim wholeheartedly in the Abyss and the Material Plane. He has received direction from his patron to scout the lands of Aglarion and investigate the Midnight Curse. Bakator is a cold and heartless individual whose soul is pure evil.

Equipment: Bakator carries a +1 war pick. He wears a suit of demon armor and the stone torc of the tower.

Ancestry: duergar, vampire spawn.

    <description>This gigantic snail is native to the Feyrealm only. Its body is covered in a metallic shell where it can withdraw with blinding speed. It is a powerful predator that disables its prey by spraying it with a slimy spray that prevents it from fleeing.

Crafting:
It requires one creature 1 hour per 5 gold pieces of resources to craft the appropriate item, requiring the necessary crafting proficiencies and tools. On the DM's discretion, some upgrades can be broken down into resources and reused when crafting new upgrades.

Feeding:
Some upgrades require specific feed and Wisdom (Medicine) skill checks to be applied regularly to the battle snail. These treatments can slightly modify the biology of the battle snail.

    <description>Blessed with the spirit and intelligence of a sprite and the wisdom of a dryad, the billie blind is a wise being in a child's body. Billie blinds are enthusiastic and dedicated about a single thing in life. They analyze their chosen subject with meticulous accuracy and learn everything they can about it. These subjects of interest may vary for each individual. One billie blind might be an expert on history, arcane or religious matters, while the other might be an enthusiast of training dogs or making tea. They are rarely encountered and live solitary lives, but sometimes they serve as advisors to noble fey. They are usually reserved and kind but can be easily angered by questioning their expertise on their favorite subject.

    <description>Spawned in the Abyss by Orcus, these colossal bloated undead are made from the flayed skin of gigantic gibbering mouthers and those of giants. These floating undead spheres fly slowly over the domain of the Demon Lord of the Undead, looking for enemies and alerting lesser minions to any threat they encounter. Their favorite tactic involves lifting their opponents from the ground and dropping them from a great height, or breaking off parts of buildings or natural formations to drop them onto their enemies.

He has a magic cigar that when lit can emulate the effects of a stinking cloud spell affecting everyone but the smoker in the area.

In a new form, the Cygnus otherwise retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and other actions are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks. If the new form has a bite attack, Cygnus can use its bite in that form.</text>

The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration. Cygnus can end this effect on its turn as part of any other action. If it is no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if it falls unconscious, this effect ends.</text>

      <text>Cygnus presents its holy symbol and speaks a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using its Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear Cygnus within 30 feet of it must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from Cygnus as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of it. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</text>

    <description>Cygnus has worn numerous guises over the millennium to hide its immortal nature. Currently, the couatl is in human form, wearing exotic clothes and armor, and wielding a strange toothed club. The celestial serpent was sent to the Material Plane by Shining Light as its champion to monitor the Dark Star. It did so from hiding, biding its time until it noticed the spark that Sarath inflamed into a beacon of hope that would overthrow the rule of the dark angels. However, the Order of the Eternal Light that came to rule the land was too radical for Cygnus, and it once again found itself on the side of mortals - Master Arlen and Razmyrel Melkar - against the Order that twisted its faith in the Shining Light. Cygnus has remained in Aglarion since and established the Lodge of Wanderlust - an adventuring guild to find and eradicate traces of the Dark Star on its fallen angels.

While in bat form, Dag'drirath can't speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies. While in mist form, Dag'drirath can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water.

    <description>The Blood Queen, Faeryl Myrryn, a drow conjurer vampire servant of Orcus, infected Dag'drirath, a vrock, with vampirism during the early years of her experiments. The demon gained new powers and rose above its demonkin but it soon found out that it also acquired new weaknesses. The Blood Queen tasked Dag'drirath with a mission on the Material Plane. However, the undead demon failed and soon found itself trapped in a ruby in the dwarven mining caverns of Darkstone. Some dwarven miners unearthed the treasure that was its prison and have inadvertently released Dag'drirath, but it is still bound by the ruby and confined to the area of the mine. Its most coveted goal is becoming free again and returning to the Abyss.

If a target's saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the dryad witch's fey charm for the next 24 hours. The dryad witch can have no more than one humanoid and up to three beasts charmed at a time.</text>

    <description>These dryads were the first to abandon King Dasmag due to the corruption of the Matrons of Malice. The dryad witches cultivate the malicious plant life of the Bleak Mire and serve their midnight hag patrons as informants. They communicate with the plants and beasts of the Feyrealm regularly and prey on those they can charm or lure into a trap.

It assimilates unimaginable amounts of information and uses it to the best effect. They are master manipulators and negotiators, knowledgeable in academic lore and the art of magic.

    <description>Frumby Goldtooth is a notorious goblin warlock, a master crafter and purveyor of wands, and secretly dedicated to the drow vampire lord and archmage conjurer Faeryl Myrryn with the ultimate goal of becoming a vampire one day. He has been exiled from Gonshar by his cousin Lord Kabok Goldtooth, who is Frumby's greatest rival and most bitter competition. Frumby specializes in crafting magic items and casting enchantments to enslave all manner of beings, whom he sells for hard gold to the right bidder or uses as servants to do his bidding. The goblin warlock has served the Matrons of Malice on many occasions but secretly plots to overtake the realm from them. However, he is wise enough to know that he lacks the power to accomplish this alone, so he is recruiting and tricking powerful allies into joining him in his goal to "liberate" the Bleak Mire.

Equipment:
Frumby wears an assortment of golden jewelry worth 564 gold pieces, a +1 glamoured studded leather armor, a ring of spell storing (with a stoneskin spell stored in it), and carries a wand of the mimic at all times.

      <text>As a bonus action, a fungoid within 30 feet distance of another fungoid can emit a cloud of communication spores that allow them to transfer basic messages between themselves. These spores numb the vocal system of other creatures, preventing them from communicating via speech. A creature within this spore cloud must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw.

    <description>Fungoids are semi-intelligent genderless mushroom creatures with humanoid-like anatomy, organizing their savage colonies into tribal units without leaders or any form of hierarchy. They feed on their own kind, which they cultivate on the flesh of their victims. The weakest and most deformed specimens are consumed first, allowing the tribe to survive even in the harshest conditions. Besides growing their own species, they also cultivate various types of mushrooms with a wide variety of magical effects.

He never knew his father, and he was only a young boy when his mother, an exceptionally beautiful woman, died. On her deathbed, she told the family that Gren's father was none other than King Waldrann Azennar, and she proved it with a love letter that the king wrote to her almost a decade ago. The letter proved genuine, but it only proves that Gren's mother and the king had an affair. The Uncanny Vagabonds couldn't care less, and they know that whatever proof they had would never be enough to turn Gren into royalty. They consider the option as one of their amusing stories and keep calling Gren "Your highness" for the fun of it.

Equipment:
Gren has 13 copper pieces, 3 silver pieces, 21 gold pieces, a +1 longsword, and a potion of healing on his person.

    <description>Upon his death at old age, Kalymorr the Gorgon Rider, the solitary druid of the King's Forest, has reincarnated as an owlbear. The Eternal Mother gifted the venerable druid with a young body of a monstrosity and allowed him to continue his work by retaining his memories and knowledge. The owlbear knows who it was in its past life, re-named itself Grorrarr, and continued with its duties.

It learned what it could from the witchcraft taught by the hags during his vivid dreams, but it still struggles to utilize them effectively.

They imprisoned the souls of the hags who resisted their rule or challenged them into the tree, thereby creating the Hagtree. The midnight hag coven closed the planar entries to their newly conquered Feyrealm domain and narrowed down the option to enter from any of the coexistent planes only through the Hagtree itself. The devious and vile hags bound to the tree allow passage to the other planes only if one sacrifices a virtue to them, which they request rather greedily.

    <description>Incubus pirates pillage the coasts of the Styx, the multiverse, or even the Material Plane for loot and slaves. They often serve as crews on planar vessels captained by greater fiends. They are hardened sailors who employ roguish tactics in addition to the guiles ebbing from their fiendish natures. They are masters of infiltration and often break down their targets' defenses before storming them in full force.

Equipment:
An incubus pirate has thieves' tools, a potion of healing, and 75 gold pieces on its person.

    <description>Krasnar Azennar, the first son of King Waldrann Azennar has a dark and tormented past. His selfish father betrayed him at an early age, and his hatred and thirst for revenge led him into the arms of the Matrons of Malice. The ex-paladin turned hexblade died when he confronted his father on the Feyrealm and soon found himself as the risen slave of his own warlock patrons who had torn away half of his soul. When the drow of House Ausstyl invaded the hags, they captured the tormented boy and turned him into a half-aberration by infusing his body with a being from beyond reality. They offered him a chance to take revenge on the midnight hags and to ravage the surface of the Feyrealm as he pleases. The once prince, now mutated monster Krasnar Azennar has the remaining half of his soul filled with anger, hatred, and an uncontrollable desire to destroy everything that was once either his ally or enemy.

Equipment:
Karnar Azennar wields a +2 glaive, carries a +1 heavy crossbow, and wears a +1 plate armor.

    <description>After the death of his wife, the late Highlady Urmissa, Lord Ziademos Gorso fell apart and escaped to total seclusion in his chambers for several years, refusing to accept food, aid, or contact from anyone, including his daughter and numerous sons. It was a mystery how he sustained himself, but one day he emerged from his room stinking, naked, covered in strange sigils, and a crazed look in his eyes. The lord's mad contemplations led him in the service of the entity he refers to as the Elemental Chaos. The crazed noble struck a pact with his patron, which gave him warlock powers and the ability to sire a bloodline with sorcerous powers of chaos. His numerous children and grandchildren are all born with these magical powers that help them spread chaos in the world and the village is filled with the children of the Gorsos, who all carry the chaotic bloodline of their progenitors.

Equipment:
Lord Ziademos Gorso wears the silver torc of the tower and wields a unicorn horn cudgel.

	• Darkness Descends: Master Bertio Ranberd can use his channel divinity to harness darkness, summoning darkness and banishing light. Master Bertio Ranberd presents his holy symbol, and summons a 30 foot radius globe of darkness that functions as the darkness spell. The globe appears in a space that he can see within 30 feet. Any magical light effect within the globe is dispelled. Additionally, each hostile creature within the globe must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 10 (2d6 + 3) necrotic damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that has total cover from Master Bertio Ranberd is not affected.

	• Turn Undead: Master Bertio Ranberd presents his holy symbol and speaks a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear him within 30 feet must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</text>

Master Bertio Ranberd is a cleric of the Darkness Within, a dogmatist and irredentist who wishes to elevate his status by serving the fallen angels.

Equipment:
Master Bertio Ranberd has 2 copper pieces, 5 silver pieces, 32 gold pieces, a holy symbol of the Darkness Within made out of jet worth 60 gold pieces, a mithral chain shirt, a wand of fire manipulation, a +1 dagger, a potion of superior healing, a potion of invisibility, and a potion of speed on his person.

Equipment:
The menagerie caretaker has 4 copper pieces, 5 silver pieces, 19 gold pieces and a leash of the beast 
tamer on his person.
