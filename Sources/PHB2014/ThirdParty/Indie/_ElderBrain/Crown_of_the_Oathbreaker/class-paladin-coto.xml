      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Sacred Oath: Inquisitor (HB)</name>
        <text>Seekers of the truth and judges of the faith, the inquisitors are paladins who vow to punish the guilty and upkeep the law set by their faith and tenets.
These paladins focus on divination magic to lift the veils of deception and to find truths that lie behind them. Their loyalty to their church and beliefs is unquestionable, as is their dedication to any mission on which they are sent. Inquisitors and their methods might vary from religion to religion, but every one of them holds a zealous fervor in common, which drives them and empowers their abilities.

Tenets of Inquisition:
The tenets of the Oath of the Inquisitor drive a paladin to seek the truth and to eliminate the hidden enemies of its faith.

Draw out the truth. The truth is not always visible. Finding it is sometimes hard, but the effort must be made. Once found, it must be announced so that others can learn it as well.

Facts only. Facts are the only truths on which you can rely. Anything else is mere speculation. One can only make a decision based on facts. Without firm evidence, even truth cannot be proven.

Oppose heresy. Seeking those who work to ruin and undermine the church's integrity is the holiest service one can do for one's faith. Therefore, one must always stay vigilant and be on the lookout for corruption and those who spread falsehoods.

Live by the law. Law provides safety and justice to all. Order is the only truth on which one can build. Those who break the law must pay the price. Therefore, one must live by the law and keep it at all costs.

Oath Spells:
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Cleansing (HB)</name>
        <text>Paladins who swear this oath dedicate their lives to purify themselves, others, and places from malign influences. They are paragons of cleanliness, both in their dwellings, places of worship, private quarters, and persons. These paladins are often found engaged in rooting out malevolent forces, whether they be diseases or poisons. They are commonly found in places of healing, sometimes accompanying armies as medics, and rarely on personal quests to cleanse places or people from harm.

Tenets of Cleansing:
The tenets of the Oath of Cleansing offer a framework for paladins of this order to keep all aspects of their lives and those of others pristine and devoid of harmful effects.

Cleanse the domain. Your surroundings reflect upon your person. Keep them spotless so that you may benefit from their immaculate nature and the purity they provide.

Cleanse the body. Your body is the shrine of your being. A healthy body is the first step to a healthy mind and soul.

Cleanse the mind. Keep your mind sharp and without filthy thoughts. Avoid substances that cloud your intellect and strive to keep it sharp.

Cleanse the soul. The soul is divine and must be protected from external influences. By righteous actions, you can fortify it and keep it unsullied.

Oath Spells:
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

Oath of Cleansing Spells:
Paladin Level | Spells
3rd | protection from evil and good, purify food and drink
5th | lesser restoration, protection from poison

    <!-- Sacred Oath: Oath of Protection (HB) -->
    <autolevel level="3">
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Protection (HB)</name>
        <text>Paladins who swear the Oath of Protection are committed to the cause of protecting people, places, or even beliefs. Their well-grounded — and often narrowly interpreted — faith leads many who take the Oath to serve religious and secular organizations. However, paladins of this Oath have often turned against these very organizations when faced with tyrannical or oppressive regimes. Paladins who follow this path usually train frequently to maintain their capacity to offer aid in all circumstances to those that need it. They also encourage charity and lead by example in sheltering the weak and downtrodden.

Tenets of Protection:
The first monarchs of Aglarion laid down the tenets of the Oath of Protection to protect their royal personages and the realm. However the oath has been shared widely by many faiths since then. Adherents to this oath hold the protection of people, places, and beliefs above all else and usually share these basic principles.

Protect those who protect us. Show respect to and safeguard those that are deserving and to whom you are sworn. Your word is your bond. Knights of the Crown take a special oath in Aglarion that stands above all other tenets: "Protect the Realm, your Sovereign, and the Crown."

Protect your allies. Keep those who depend on you from harm if threatened by forces greater than themselves. Shield those who are in allegiance with you as a bastion against harm. Join forces with your allies to overcome threats.

Protect those who stand behind you. Lead by example to become a beacon of inspiration to those around you, especially against seemingly insurmountable odds.

Protect yourself if there is nothing left to protect. Fortify your faith so that you may stand firm against that which makes you vulnerable. Be willing to sacrifice even your own life before all others. Tend to your own well-being, so that you may safeguard your charge until the very last.

Oath Spells:
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

Oath of Protection Spells:
Paladin Level | Spells
3rd | protection from evil and good, shield of faith
5th | protection from poison, warding bond
9th | magic circle, protection from energy
13th | death ward, guardian of faith
17th | dispel evil and good, raise dead

        <text>You can use your Channel Divinity to bolster your defenses. As a bonus action, you can utter a vow of protection from a creature you can see within 30 feet of you, using your Channel Divinity.

        <name>Channel Divinity: Divine Ward (Oath of Protection (HB))</name>
        <text>You can use your Channel Divinity to offer protection to those around you. As an action, you present your holy symbol and each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you becomes warded for 1 minute. Any creature who targets a warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This effect doesn't protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball. If the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell that affects an enemy creature, this effect ends. This effect ends on the creature if you are incapacitated or die or if the warded creature is more than 30 feet away from you.
