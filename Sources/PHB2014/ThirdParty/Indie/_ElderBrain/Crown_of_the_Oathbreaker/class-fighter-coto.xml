        <text>Giving orders is second nature to a commander. These exemplary fighters lead their squadrons by inspiring their subordinates and bolstering their fighting prowess through the strength of their voices and their presence. As a result, the forces under their command can achieve incredible feats of battle, even when odds are stacked against them.

        <name>Commander's Orders (Commander (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, you can inspire others through the power of your commands. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose any number of creatures other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. Those creatures gain one Command die, a d6.
	Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Command die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Command die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Command die at a time. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.
	Your Command die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The dice becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

        <text>Those who offer their martial skills for hire face various challenges with each mission. Their most essential skills are surviving any threat, standing their ground in any situation they face, and overcoming their foes. A good mercenary is always prepared for the unexpected and will creatively improvise a solution to meet the requirements of the battle. Most of the large mercenary companies operate out of the Drayl City States where this type of warfare based on swords-for-hire has long-established traditions.
