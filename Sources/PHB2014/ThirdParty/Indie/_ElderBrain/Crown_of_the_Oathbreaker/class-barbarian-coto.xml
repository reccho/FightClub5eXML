        <name>Primal Path: Path of the Fear Rager (HB)</name>
        <text>Taking advantage of one's weakness is a crucial tactic in combat. These barbarians learn how to instill fear in their enemies and exploit their opponents' hesitation when facing a raging menace. The disregard and disdain these barbarians feel for those who fear them gives them an extra surge of power as if they would feed on the fear they create. Many of the Vordani war tribes use this tactic to overcome their foes.

        <text>The drow of House Ausstyl keep some of their offspring in an almost feral state, training them to harness their rage in combat. When these children are initiated to the wrath of the otherworldly entities they venerate, they are infused with aberrant flesh that quickly spreads in their bodies like a parasite.

        <name>Primal Path: Path of the Spelleater (HB)</name>
        <text>Some barbarians, mainly those who live under the oppression of magic users, have learned to use sheer power to overcome magic. These individuals, called Spelleaters by the Vordani tribes, are able to withstand spells of all sorts by tensing their muscles to block magical energies from affecting them physically. Some spelleaters can even utilize these energies to vitalize their bodies and benefit from them instead of being harmed by their baleful effects.
