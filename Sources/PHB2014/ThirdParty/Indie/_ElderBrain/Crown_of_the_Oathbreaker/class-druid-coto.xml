      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Druid Circle: Circle of the Bloom (HB)</name>
        <text>The Circle of the Bloom unites all druids who nurture flora and dedicate their lives to cultivating all forms of plant life. These druids tend to nature wherever their travels lead them, often tasked with important roles within farming communities but just as often living solitary lives in wilderness areas with heavy vegetation. Many druids of the circle might seem extremely introverted, slow, and even antisocial towards people, as they prefer to converse with plants and are used to the cyclical and slower nature of plant life.
