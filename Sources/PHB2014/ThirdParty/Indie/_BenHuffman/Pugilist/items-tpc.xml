    <text>These unremarkable brass knuckles appear well used if not well loved. They are covered in dings and scratches accompanied by the odd stain.
	You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can use your reaction to attempt to maim them. When you do, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 16) or be maimed in one of the following ways of your choice:

	• Broken Arm: The creature has disadvantage with weapon attack rolls.
	• Broken Leg: The creature's walking speed is halved.
	• Broken Ribs: The creature has disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity ability checks and saving throws.
	• Broken Skull: Attack rolls against the creature are considered one higher for the purposes of determining whether or not the result is a critical.

The maimed condition ends on a creature only after they have received medical treatment from a trained professional and rested for one month or they are targeted by a greater restoration spell or similar magic. After you use this ability to attempt to maim a creature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Unarmed: When you make an unarmed attack you can choose to deal the damage of this weapon instead of your normal unarmed attack damage.

Proficiency: martial, knuckles

	Additionally, this club has 5 charges. When you deal damage with this weapon, you can expend one or more charges to attempt to render the creature unconscious. When you do, roll 5d8 (+2d8 for each charge expended beyond the first). If the creature has a number of hit points remaining that is equal to or less than the total of your roll, the creature forgets everything it saw and heard over the last minute and is unconscious for 1 hour or until another person uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake.

The club regains 1d3 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.

    <text>You can use an action to blow this unassuming whistle that's inaudible to all creatures except canines. When you do, you cast the conjure animals spell but can only choose to summon two dire wolves or eight wolves. You do not need to maintain concentration, but the duration is 10 minutes instead of 1 hour. Once you do, this magic cannot be used again until dawn of the next day.

    <text>This wool-lined, off-white leather glove is frigid to the touch, but comfortable when worn. Once attuned to this magic item, you can cause an icicle to grow from the glove, making it function like a katar. Alternatively, you can launch an icicle from the glove, acting like a hand crossbow. In both cases, these weapons deal cold damage instead of piercing damage.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you attack a creature with this magic weapon and roll a 20 its speed is halved until the end of its next turn. This does not affect creatures who are immune to cold damage.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Unarmed: When you make an unarmed attack you can choose to deal the damage of this weapon instead of your normal unarmed attack damage.

Proficiency: martial, knuckles
