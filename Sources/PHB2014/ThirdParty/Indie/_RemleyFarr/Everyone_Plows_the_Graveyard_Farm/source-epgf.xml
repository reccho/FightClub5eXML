  <description>Giant bugs have ravaged the farming town of Castillo, and as society crumbles, warring factions rise from the rubble. Can the PC's navigate this new society well enough to find an altruistic solution, or will they choose a side and determine who will rule the dead-littered town?

"Everyone Plows the Graveyard Farm" is a 6-12 hour long, sandbox style Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition adventure designed for 3-5 players at levels 1-3. Players will meet several warring factions within a rural town that has been obliterated by an onslaught of giant bugs. Dungeon Masters will play the role of these friendly and hostile factions, which may change their political stance based on the party's interactions. Discovering Castillo's history will greatly aid the party in finding a solution.</description>
