The swallowed target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the deerlizard, and it takes 10 (3d6) acid damage at the start of each of the deerlizard's turns. The deerlizard can have only one target swallowed at a time. If the deerlizard dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.</text>

    <description>Bred by mages, the deerlizard is a domestic animal meant to ferry heavy cargo around mountains, but Don Diego uses them to eat giant bugs.

    </trait>
    <description>Victim of the bile seed tree, Aguilito is a hodgepodge of body parts within the bile seed tree's root system. The tree manipulated Aguilito's magic intuition and absorbed the arcane connections from Gamelia's spellbook, imbibing the tree with altered forms of the giant insect and raise dead spells. Like lizardfolk shamans of the past, Aguilito now "lives on" inside his own bile seed tree, which has entwined itself in the catacombs. He wishes to be destroyed.

      <text>Catarina's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (Spell save DC 13). She can cast the following spells, requiring a lyre or harp as a spellcasting focus:

    <description>Born deaf, Catarina learned to play the harp and lyre from her uncle, Marco, by feeling the vibrations in the air. At times, the Del Barco magic flowed through her, letting her change the weather according to her mood with her song. In death, she wandered into the Del Barco Mansion basement.

    <description>Baseborn son of Dandeno II, Marco dabbled into the mysticism of his family's past in an attempt to gain fame and glory. After the twins died and their parents sank into depression, Marco took Catarina and Aguilito under his wing. He accidentally killed everyone except Aguilito after fiddling around with beholder eyes and his great-great-aunt Halobera's brass-lensed instruments. In death, he wallows in misery before the altar of Loviatar.

    <description>Baseborn daughter of Dandeno II. Knew that the official family lineage wouldn't pass to her or her brother, Marco, since they were both bastards, so she shirked dutiful marriage and instead learned to fence. Grew unstoppable in one-on-one combat. Ended her fighting career with a disastrous exhibition gladiator match against a displacer beast that made her lose her arm. Marco tried regrowing her arm using a beholder eye, but she instead grew three arms. Stayed out of sight ever since. In death, she lurks the catacombs, attacking intruders with several weapons.

    <trait>
      <name>Blessed Loam</name>
      <text>Oag Roa instantly reverts to the form of a Tiny plant seed if not within 30 ft. of a plant blessed for its occupancy. Blessing a 40 ft.-by-40 ft. area of plants can be done by burying a seed of any kind with one drop of humanoid blood and a bone fragment from any beast. The 40 ft.-by-40 ft. area becomes blessed within 24 hours and stays blessed until Oag Roa has been away from it for 7 days.</text>

    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Secede to Seed</name>
      <text>When Oag Roa drops to 0 hit points, it transforms into a Tiny plant seed (as in the shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious. When it has 0 hit points in its seed form, it must be buried in a blessed loam within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in a blessed loam, it reverts to its Medium elf woman form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in a blessed loam with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Shapechanger</name>
      <text>If Oag Roa is in a blessed grove, it can use its action to polymorph into a Large bear, Medium elf woman, cloud of flower petals, or Tiny plant seed.

        While in its cloud of flower petals form, Oag Roa can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 30 ft., can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the cloud of flower petals can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It is vulnerable to fire and poison damage while in this form. While in its plant seed form, it has 10 hit points, an AC of 10, vulnerability to fire damage, and incapacitated.</text>

    <description>A sin against nature and the Feywild itself, Oag Roa haunts groves blessed by Ayder's Raiders. A mass of faerie energy and demon influence, Oag Roa looks like a beautiful elven maiden on the outside, but it can reshape into a demonic bear-beast or a cloud of flower petals. Those who encounter Oag Roa usually come face-to-face with their darkest, most hedonistic desires as Oag Roa loves to trick people into humoring their sadism.
