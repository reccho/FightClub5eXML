  <description>A medical shipment to the swampy town of Strade's Gallows takes a turn for the eccentric when the party happens across enigmatic shrimp-men who begin to worship them as gods. Can the party solve the mystery of Strade's Gallows' ailment, or will their new disciples botch it all up?

"Fishing for Gods in Strade's Gallows" is a Dungeons and Dragons 5emodule designed for 3-5 players at levels 2-3. This adventure has sandbox style gameplay and may take 5-10 hours to complete depending on side quest completion. Adventurers will deal with corrupt town guards, swamp witches, a sunken fort, and kuo-toa fanatics that believe a party member to be a deity. Solid roleplay and political gambling matter just as much as swordsmanship. Original monster entries and dungeon maps can be found in the appendices.</description>
