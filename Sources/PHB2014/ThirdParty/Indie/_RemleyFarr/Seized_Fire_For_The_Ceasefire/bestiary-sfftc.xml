      <name>Swallow</name>
      <text>The remorhaz makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, that creature takes the bite's damage and is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the remorhaz, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the remorhaz's turns.

If the remorhaz takes 40 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the remorhaz must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet oft he remorhaz. If the remorhaz dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.</text>

    <description>Fleur Sleetshaper was a rare gem of a dwarf: born from a northern clan, she dedicated her life to the study of fire and ice magic.

After building an icy tower on a glacier, she helped found the crabbing village of Firnboro, but in the last thirty  years, she and the people of Firnboro have disappeared.

Did Fleur's arcane studies have a hand in Firnboro's disappearance?
