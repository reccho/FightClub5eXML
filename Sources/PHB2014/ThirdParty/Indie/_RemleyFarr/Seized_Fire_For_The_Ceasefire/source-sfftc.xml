  <description>Fleur Sleetshaper was a rare gem of a dwarf: born from a northern clan, she dedicated her life to the study of fire and ice magic. After building an icy tower on a glacier, she helped found the crabbing village of Firnboro, but in the last thirty years, she and the people of Firnboro have disappeared. Did Fleur's arcane studies have a hand in Firnboro's disappearance?"

"Seized Fire for the Ceasefire" is a Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition module for a party of 3-5 players at level 10. This one-shot module features an icy setting and a wizard's tower's worth of loot. Also, the nomadic group of whale-people that now inhabit Firnboro can provide entertaining interactions, possibly becoming strong allies.</description>
