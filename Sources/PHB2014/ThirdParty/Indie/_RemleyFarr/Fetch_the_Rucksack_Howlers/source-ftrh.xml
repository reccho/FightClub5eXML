  <description>Gnolls and humans living together? Such an event was deemed impossible until Simon Rucksack, a halfling kennelmaster, domesticated the Cragteeth Warband. But can the gnolls truly learn civilized kinship, or will their natural killer instinct come slavering back?

"Fetch the Rucksack Howlers" is a Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition module designed for 3-5 players at level 1. This module features a desolate town of gnolls on the verge of collapse. The players will be at a moral dillema: side with a fanatic, murdering automaton or allow the gnolls' former pack lord to steal them back.</description>
