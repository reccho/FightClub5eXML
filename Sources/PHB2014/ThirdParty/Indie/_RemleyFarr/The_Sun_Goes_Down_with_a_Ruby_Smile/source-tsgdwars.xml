  <description>A small port seems the perfect place to dock when a freak storm forces the small trade cog, Sea's Rock, to find solid ground. But the newly discovered port town raises questions: where are all the residents, and are any of them still alive?

Designed for 3-5 players at level 1. This module favors investigative and inquisitive playstyles over kicking in the door with swords drawn. The players will explore an abandoned seaside lumber camp full of murdered bodiesâ€”only a feral half-orc child remains. Soon a darker secret unfolds, and as treasure stacks up, so does the body count.</description>
