When you hit a creature of Large size or smaller with this weapon, you can attempt to grapple the creature instead of dealing damage. When you do so, you use your attack roll for the grapple check, rather than making a Strength (Athletics) check. While grappling a creature with this weapon, you can't use the weapon on another target.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

    <range>20/60</range>
    <text>Special: You can use an action to tie a rope to the end of a harpoon before it is thrown. If a ropetied harpoon hits a target, it becomes embedded in the target, and you can use an action on subsequent turns to hold fast to the rope and make an opposed Strength (Athletics) check against the target to pull it up to 10 feet closer to you. Additionally, when the target moves, you can use your reaction to make an opposed Strength (Athletics) check against it, preventing its movement on a success. If you use your action to do anything else, you lose your grip on the rope. If the target has hands, it can remove the harpoon as an action.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

Explosive: When this weapon's projectile hits a target, it explodes in a 15-foot diameter sphere. The projectile can target an unoccupied space within its range. Each creature other than the target within the blast radius (for a Medium or smaller target, each creature within 5 feet of it) must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking half the damage rolled on a failed save or no damage on a successful one.

    <text>Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Explosive: When this weapon's projectile hits a target, it explodes in a 15-foot diameter sphere. The projectile can target an unoccupied space within its range. Each creature other than the target within the blast radius (for a Medium or smaller target, each creature within 5 feet of it) must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking half the damage rolled on a failed save or no damage on a successful one.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

    <text>Ammo: musket ball

Renaissance-Era firearms, such as flintlocks and muskets, are weapons that have taken the first steps away from heavy cannons and into portable rifles, making them the progenitors of all modern firearms. Weapons from this era use musket balls and loose black powder, and are therefore slow to reload and more prone to malfunction. Importantly, these weapons exist comfortably in many fantasy settings alongside bows, swords, and axes, especially where pirates are at play.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Dry: If this weapon is ever submerged in water or doused with a significant quantity of water, it jams. A jammed firearm can't be used to make an attack until a creature uses its action to clear the weapon malfunction.

Misfire: When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll with this weapon, it jams. A jammed weapon can't be used to make an attack until a creature uses its action to clear the weapon malfunction.

Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Industrial Age firearms, such as revolvers and double-barrel shotguns, stem from advancements in machinery and assembly lines, granting them more interchangeable parts and cartridged bullets. These guns lacked the clean assembly-line consistency of modern firearms, but laid down the bedrock for designs that have not changed much since: a classic six-shot revolver is as timeless as it is effective. While the heyday of Industrial Age firearms was in the Wild West, their simple and reliable construction means they are still commonplace in the modern day.

Special: This weapon deals double damage to objects and structures.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon.

	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

Mounted: This weapon is normally used while attached to a tripod, vehicle, or other bracing mount. You can mount or unmount this weapon as an action. While it is mounted, it can't be moved. It can only be used to make an attack while unmounted if held by a Medium or larger creature with a Strength score of at least 15.

Modern firearms have embraced automatic fire, ammunition magazines, and lighter caliber bullets (which can travel at much higher speeds). For these guns, form begets function: weapons are designed for a specific role, such as sniper rifles for long range and shotguns for close quarters, and every aspect of their design supports this role. Moreover, weapons that enjoyed success in the West, such as the double-barrel shotgun, can still be found in use today.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Automatic: When you make an attack with this weapon on your turn, you can choose to make two attacks instead. These attacks are always made with disadvantage, regardless of circumstance. These attacks use twice the normal amount of ammunition.

Foregrip: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. If used in two hands, its normal range increases by 50 feet and its long range increases by 200 feet.

Moreover, weapons that enjoyed success in the West, such as the double-barrel shotgun, can still be found in use today.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

Sighted: This weapon has disadvantage on attack rolls made against targets within 20 feet.

Automatic: When you make an attack with this weapon on your turn, you can choose to make two attacks instead. These attacks are always made with disadvantage, regardless of circumstance. These attacks use twice the normal amount of ammunition.

Heat: This weapon gains 1 heat point whenever an attack is made with it, and it loses 1 heat point at the start of each of your turns. If the weapon has 3 heat points, it overheats and loses all heat points. An overheated weapon can't be used to make an attack again until the end of your next turn.

Scatter (2d10): If you make an attack against a target that is within half this weapon's normal range, you deal the damage value listed in parentheses instead of the weapon's normal damage dice.

All switch weapons are exotic, so only craftsmen natively gain proficiency in their use. However, a switch weapon's individual forms might strongly resemble weapons a character is already familiar with, so it may be easier to learn than other exotic weapons.
	The GM can allow a character to gain proficiency with a switch weapon by practicing with it for seven days, assisted by a tutor that already has proficiency. The character must have proficiency with weapons that exactly match the statistics of each of the weapon's forms.

Switch: This weapon has two forms. You can swap between which weapon is being used at any time, even between attacks.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>All switch weapons are exotic, so only craftsmen natively gain proficiency in their use. However, a switch weapon's individual forms might strongly resemble weapons a character is already familiar with, so it may be easier to learn than other exotic weapons.
	The GM can allow a character to gain proficiency with a switch weapon by practicing with it for seven days, assisted by a tutor that already has proficiency. The character must have proficiency with weapons that exactly match the statistics of each of the weapon's forms.

Switch: This weapon has two forms. You can swap between which weapon is being used at any time, even between attacks.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

Superheavy: This weapon is unusually large for its type. You must have a Strength score of 16 or higher to wield a superheavy weapon.

All switch weapons are exotic, so only craftsmen natively gain proficiency in their use. However, a switch weapon's individual forms might strongly resemble weapons a character is already familiar with, so it may be easier to learn than other exotic weapons.
	The GM can allow a character to gain proficiency with a switch weapon by practicing with it for seven days, assisted by a tutor that already has proficiency. The character must have proficiency with weapons that exactly match the statistics of each of the weapon's forms.

Switch: This weapon has two forms. You can swap between which weapon is being used at any time, even between attacks.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.
