    <trait>
      <name>Gunslinger</name>
      <text>Critical, the class

Narrowed eyes, smoking barrels. Gunslingers live on the edge, brandishing a special resource called risk dice to keep them alive by the skin of their teeth. Play a gunslinger if you enjoy scoring powerful critical hits and having an entire arsenal of guns at your disposal.

A glass falls, clattering to the floor, and the tavern grows silent. A dwarf with a deep scowl, dripping with freshly spilled beer, leers at a nearby drunken orc and fingers for a pair of revolvers at his waist.
	High on a hillside, carefully concealed beneath foliage and stones, a marksman steadies her breathing and adjusts her scope, acquiring her target and waiting for the moment to strike.
	Risk is in a gunslinger's blood. They are bold renegades, bucking tradition and forging a new path with dangerous and inelegant firearms. Gunslingers are infamous for surviving by their wits, relying on split-second timing and a considerable amount of luck to survive.

Gunslingers in other settings:
The Equipment chapter of this book organizes firearms by ages-Renaissance, Industrial Age, and Modern—but these don't include fantasy settings set before the advent of black powder. In such settings, you can present gunslingers in the following ways:

Gunslingers with Crossbows. You gain proficiency with all crossbows, including exotic crossbows, and can use crossbows whenever a gunslinger feature refers to an attack with a firearm. At 11th level, the Mankiller feature instead adds an extra die of damage to crossbow damage rolls.

Gunslingers as Inventors. You are the only individual with firearms, because you invented black powder (or a close analog to it) personally. Though your alchemical discovery is groundbreaking, the process is costly, complex, and above all, top secret.

Gunslingers as Wand-Mages. Your firearms are loaded wands, screeching with elemental fire instead of leaded bullets. These magic items lack the finesse of a wand of magic missiles, but come in plenty of sizes, pre-charged with arcana. Use radiant, force, or necrotic damage for the damage of your firearm attacks. Furthermore, consider "reloading" your wands a s simply allowing them to recharge.

    <trait>
      <name>Guts and Gunpowder</name>
      <text>Black powder is not for the faint of heart. Its thunderous applause is volatile and imprecise—a barely controlled explosion directed at an enemy. Unlike a sword or a bow, a firearm can explode i n your hands, and its ammunition turns into a bomb whenever it catches a spark. Only the truly mad or eerily stalwart choose to become gunslingers.
	Gunslingers hurl death from their guns in a roaring cacophony. Whenever they draw their weapons, life or death hangs in the balance, hinging on their guts, snap decision-making, and quick aim.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Dangerous Outsiders</name>
      <text>A gunslinger's explosive lifestyle lends well to wandering and adventuring. Gunslingers often shoot first and ask questions later, an attitude that earns them few friends and plentiful enemies. In their travels, most gunslingers are secretive and go to great lengths to remain incognito, lest they be spotted by old foes with scores to settle.
	Yet their skills are always in demand. Anyone seeking protection or revenge can count on a gunslinger when they roll into town. After all, gunslingers often pick up odd jobs to make ends meet, and they have one truly marketable skill.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Creating a Gunslinger</name>
      <text>When creating your gunslinger, consider where firearms fit in the campaign's world and what the common perceptions are of those who use them. If firearms are the norm, your gunslinger might be a mercenary or militia fighter. If firearms are rare, your gunslinger might be one of a kind, a trailblazer in new types of warfare.
	It's also not unusual for a gunslinger to be haunted by their past. Did some event drive you to the gun and motivate you to travel? Is there a bounty on your head in one or more areas? Do you have any old enemies that seek you for revenge?

Quick Build:
To make a gunslinger quickly, follow these suggestions. Make Dexterity and Constitution your highest ability scores. If you plan to choose the Gun Tank creed, instead make Strength your highest ability score. Lastly, choose any background, preferably one that emphasizes your familiarity with firearms and penchant for risk-taking.</text>

        <name>Multiclass Gunslinger</name>
        <text>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player's Handbook, here's what you need to know if you choose gunslinger as one of your classes.

Ability Score Minimum:
As a multiclass character, you must have at least the following ability score(s) to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a gunslinger.

	• Dexterity 13

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Multiclass Features</name>
        <text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does).
	Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared:
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.
	Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
	If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots:
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
	If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.
	For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic:
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

Risk Dice. You have four risk dice, which are d8s. You gain additional risk dice, and your risk dice change as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Risk Dice column of the Gunslinger table. You regain all expended risk dice when you finish a long rest.

Using Risk Dice. Once per turn, you can expend a risk die to perform a deed of your choice. Your deed options are detailed in the 'Deeds' feature.

Saving Throws. Some of your deeds require your target to make a saving throw to resist the deed's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated a s follows:

	Deed save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

Bite the Bullet:
As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one risk die to gain temporary hit points equal the number rolled on the die + your Constitution modifier.

Covering Fire:
When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can expend one risk die as a bonus action to cow the creature. Roll the risk die and subtract it from the next attack roll the creature makes before the start of your next turn.

Dodge Roll:
You can expend one risk die as a bonus action to move up to 15 feet and reload any firearm you are holding. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, ignores difficult terrain, and allows you to move through a hostile creature's space, as long as you don't end your movement there.

Limb Shot:
When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can expend one risk die as a bonus action and aim for one of its limbs, attempting to force it to drop one item of your choice that it is holding. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.

Skin of your Teeth:
When an attacker you can see makes an attack roll against you, you can expend a risk die as a reaction to dodge out of harm's way at the last second. You add the risk die to your AC against this attack, potentially causing it to miss.

Steady Aim:
On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one risk die to double the normal and maximum range for the next ranged weapon attack you make.

Cantrips. You learn finger guns and two other cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

Spell Slots. The Spellslinger Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher. You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and evocation spells on the wizard spell list.
	The Spells Known column of the Spellslinger Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
	The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.
	Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level.

Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Some gunslingers live by a code and expect others to do the same. These gunslingers, known as white hats, sometimes serve as agents of local or regional law but never hesitate to do what's right no matter what the rules say.
