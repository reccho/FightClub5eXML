        <text>A type of lycanthrope, gradually transforms into a ferocious beast.

Whether by infected bite or insidious curse, your blood was marked by the indelible stain of beasthood, a curse of lycanthropy. A new form, a primal, bestial self, lies just beneath your skin, awaiting the allure of blood and the thrill of a hunt to emerge in a terrible spectacle. Perhaps, if you can avoid the violence of combat or the siren call of moonlight, you can resist the lycanthropic urge. Or perhaps you see the infection as a blessing, a fearsome weapon, with claws that rend and teeth that bite.

Darkvision. You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision from your race, its range increases by 30 feet.

Whenever you take damage or deal damage to a hostile creature with an attack, add the total number together; this is your damage pool. You gain a bonus to your damage rolls, as well as additional beastlike abilities, according to your total damage pool, as shown on the Bestial Aspect table. After 1 minute of taking and dealing no damage, reset your damage pool to 0.

Bestial Aspect:
Damage Pool | Damage Bonus | Ability
0 | — | —
10 | +2 | You sprout a set of vicious claws, which are natural weapons you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Your claws count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
20 | +2 | You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't silvered.
30 | +2 | Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.
40 | +3 | You gain blindsight with a range of 10 feet.
50 | +3 | You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.
70 | +3 | Your walking speed increases by an additional 10 feet (20 feet total).

        <name>Ranger Archetype: Freerunner (HB)</name>
        <text>An agile runner that uses their momentum to strike harder.

Agile, evasive, and unmoored from the constraints that slow down other rangers, the archetypal freerunner is supremely nimble and capable of crossing terrain faster than anyone else. They accomplish this through a skilled combination of dashing, leaping, and nimbly climbing that guides them down clever paths through their environments. Moreover, an adept freerunner can convert the momentum from their gymnastics into deadly force, crushing their enemies with exceptional impact from unexpected directions.
	A freerunner is most at home in a city or in the treetops of a great forest, for their unique movement requires a place that is steeped with complex geometry which reaches high into the sky. Of course, even on flat terrain, a freerunner's agility is not to be underestimated, for they can dive through a giant's legs or scurry up its back with ease.

You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks made to navigate obstacles while running and can use Dexterity in place of Strength when making a Strength (Athletics) check to climb, jump, or swing on a rope.
	Additionally, you have mastered a number of techniques. You can use your freerunning techniques a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier, and regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. While in your favored terrain, using a technique doesn't count against your total number of uses.

Slide. As a bonus action, you can move up to 10 feet without spending movement through another creatures space or squeeze up to 10 feet through a smaller space.

Tumble. As a bonus action, you can nimbly jump, dive, or roll up to 10 feet in a straight line without spending movement. During this movement, any opportunity attacks made against you have disadvantage.

Wall Run. As a bonus action, you can choose to run along a vertical surface as part of your movement. Until the end of your turn, you gain a climb speed equal to your walking speed. If you jump while running along a wall, you can complete the distance of your jump, even if doing so would exceed your speed.

For bandits, bank robbers, and green-clad folk heroes, there's no better way to make money than robbing nobles at knifepoint, especially in caravans. None are more prosperous at roadside robbery, perhaps, than highwaymen, who leverage their stealth and superior numbers to steal anything they wish before escaping into the trees with their bounty. A team of bandits works in smooth coordination, watching each others' backs in a choreographed theater of shouting, looting, and cutting down anyone who runs.

        <text>A witch-hunter and mage-killer with unique antimagic abilities.

When a wizard embraces forbidden, volatile magic, or a sorcerer loses control of their arcane power, a spellbreaker is not far behind. This ancient order of rangers tracks dangerous spellcasters, from rogue bards to demonic warlocks, and eliminates them before their magic can wreak havoc on an entire city or endanger the multiverse itself. They are trained in techniques to bypass magical defenses and rip small holes in the fabric of magic itself to catch unaware any spellcaster in their midst. While most spellbreakers execute their quarry or capture them for the authorities, a few still burn witches at the stake, earning all spellbreakers a grim reputation. For this reason alone, a mage on the run has good reason to look over their shoulder and fear the spellbreaker's arrival.

Once on each of your turns, when you make an attack against a creature you can see, you can use your bonus action to deliver a small antimagic pulse. For the duration of the attack and damage rolls, the effects of spells targeting the creature, as well as the properties and powers of magic items worn or carried by the creature, are suppressed. This disrupts spells like mage armor or mirror image which protect the creature, as well as spells like hellish rebuke which are triggered as a reaction to the attack or damage roll. On a hit, the creature takes an extra 1d6 force damage, or an extra 2d6 force damage if it was concentrating on a spell when it was attacked.

But some rangers take this further, obsessing over a single kill at a time and hunting their quarry to the ends of the earth. Archetypal trophy hunters might track any creature, provided that it is as threatening as it is colossal, but are so named for the horns, claws, and teeth they bring back-trophies of a successful hunt.

        <name>Catchphrase! (Vigilante (HB))</name>
        <text>By 15th level, your personal catchphrase has gained supernatural levels of cultural caché. You can utter your catchphrase whenever you hit a creature with an attack roll, beat a creature in an opposed Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check, or when you succeed on a saving throw. Until the start of your next turn, you have resistance to all damage and can add your Wisdom modifier to damage rolls.
	Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you score a critical hit on a hostile creature or finish a short or long rest.
