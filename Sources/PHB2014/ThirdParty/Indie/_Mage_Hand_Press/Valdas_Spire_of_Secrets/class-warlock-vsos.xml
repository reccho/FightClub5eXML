        <text>As a bonus action, you can summon a cloak, coat, or robe which aids your movement and mobility. This pact cloak appears on your body, fitting over any other clothes or armor, and it doesn't impede your movement, vision, or your ability to wear other equipment. While wearing your pact cloak, you constantly float a few inches off the ground. You ignore the effects of difficult terrain, your speed increases by 10 feet, and you can walk across fluid surfaces such as water and quicksand.
	You can dismiss your pact cloak as a bonus action.

        <text>The necromantic astral fog converts hit points into spell slots, and vice versa.

The starry expanse of the Astral Plane contains horrors both great and small, but none rival the mass of astral fog known as the Dead Mists. An inky smoke that curls and drifts about the plane, they are infamous for claiming every incautious traveler that wanders into their misty embrace. Yet the Dead Mists aren't a mere astral hazard: they possess a grim intelligence, an intent, and a bottomless well of necromantic power.
	Warlocks that embrace the Dead Mists unlock a terrible type of necromancy: the ability to trade pure life essence for arcana. As such, the Dead Mists slowly consume their warlocks, granting them surges of arcane power in exchange for every drop of life they possess.

        <text>Via strange chronomancy, your patron is you-from the future.

Your patron is you in a decades-distant future. Perhaps your future self found an artifact of great power connecting them to the past, which they must now lead you to discover, or perhaps they were taught the mystic arts by their future self long ago, a cycle you will have to continue by teaching yourself someday. Your future self has forgotten the fine details of some things, and outright refuses to tell you about things you "can't know yet," but offers compelling insight and guidance nonetheless. You're not quite sure what your future self is planning for your future (and for their past), but one thing is certain-they need you alive.

Future You Quirks:
Strange effects linger after communicating with your future self. You gain one of the following traits:

Future You Quirks:
d6 | Personality Traits
1 | You often speak in the wrong tense or refer to yourself in a plural.
2 | You sometimes refer to a person you just met by name, before they've introduced themselves.
3 | Even in dire circumstances, you are unreasonably calm.
4 | In certain lighting, you look much older than you are.
5 | Seeing certain people alive can instantly reduce you to tears.
6 | Your future fashion sense clashes completely with that of today.

        <text>Starting at 1st level, your discussions of the future with yourself have given you some periphery knowledge about how events played out. When you take a short or long rest, your GM rolls a d20 and a d4 in secret and records the number rolled on the d20. The GM tells you the number recorded, unless they rolled a 4 on the d4; in that case, they give you false information: a random number from 1 to 20.
	You can replace any attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you make with this recorded value. You must choose to do so before the roll and can only use this recorded value once. If the GM gave you false information, they inform you after you replace the roll.

None of this is real, not a lick of it. You, me, the whole damn world: were nothing but pencil scratches on some pieces of paper. It doesn't matter if you believe me, because there's nothing you or I can do about it. The world is the way it is, and it only exists so long as the GM wants to tell a story. After that, the whole thing goes poof.
	The GM isn't one creature. It might be male, female, or neither. Maybe it's old, young, smart, dumb, or any one of a million different things. The GM may be no more powerful than a commoner in its own world, but to our world, its will is absolute. The GM grants us our powers, and its laws and decisions dictate the way everything in our world works. In fact, it can change the very fabric of reality on a whim. Those that fight the will of the GM find that its ire is easy to rouse and hard to be rid of, but if you cater to its wishes and play along with the story that it wants to tell, you might find that things go very well for you.

Rather than forging a pact inked by blood or bound to your soul, you have inherited a Legacy, a patron embodied by a line of inheritors sworn to a sacred cause. In so doing, you have acquired a relic of this ancient legacy, an object of unimaginable power passed down through the generations or recently uncovered from a long-lost civilization. With it, you can transform into the most powerful version of yourself to continue your Legacy's fight.
	Countless Legacies have imbued warlocks with ancient powers, and only a few remain today, but each possesses a unique type of relic and bestows a unique type of transformation. How you use this transformation is ultimately up to you, but the Legacy conspires to see you achieve greatness and advance its unknowable ancient goals.

Magical Girls and Superheroes:
Underneath its dramatic exterior, The Legacy patron draws inspiration from magical girl anime and superhero comics. Play a Legacy warlock to inject more anime tropes into your campaign, and to finally answer the question of how to play Sailor Moon in 5e.

Your battle die changes and more battle dice become available when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Battle Dice table on the next page.

        <text>When you reach 10th level, you learn to alter your spellcasting in a number of ways, both to hide it from your audience and to expand your magical repertoire. Whenever you cast a warlock spell of 1st level or higher using a warlock spell slot, you can manipulate it in one of two ways:

Conceal. You can cast the spell without using spell components by succeeding on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The DC for this check equals 8 + the spell's level. On a failure, the spell fails and its spell slot is wasted. You can't use this ability on a spell with material components that have a cost.

Transmute. You can attempt to cast any other spell from the wizard spell list of the same level or lower instead of the spell you initially cast. When you do so, you must succeed on a Charisma check with a DC equal to 12 + the spell's level. Otherwise, the spell fails and its spell slot is wasted.

        <name>Otherworldly Patron: The Symbiont (HB)</name>
        <text>An oozelike parasite dwells inside the body, emerging for deadly melee combat.

Though most warlocks forge pacts with distant, intangible entities, your patron is a physical being of incomprehensible power—a being that dwells inside your very body. This arrangement was struck in the spirit of symbiosis: your patron, which resembles a muscular, living ichor, requires a mortal dwelling, and you in turn may profit from its magic. You can even draw your patron out from where it resides in your blood, causing it to seep forth onto your skin until you are a monstrous hybrid of ichor, replete with claws and teeth to rend your foes asunder.

list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The
following spells are added to the warlock spell list for
you.

Symbiont Expanded Spells:

1st | entangle, longstrider
2nd | blur, enlarge/reduce
3rd | haste, meld into stone

        <name>Symbiotic Transformation (The Symbiont (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting when you choose this patron at 1st level, you can draw out your Symbiont, which proceeds to coat your body in a living slime exoskeleton. You can undergo this transformation or reverse it as a bonus action on your turn. While transformed, you can't cast spells, but transforming doesn't break your concentration or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell that you've already cast. While transformed, you gain the following benefits:

The Flesh. When you aren't wearing armor, your base AC is 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier. You can use The Flesh to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use The Flesh.

The Claws. You sprout a set of wicked claws, which you can use as natural melee weapons to make claw attacks. You are proficient with your claw attacks and can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength, for their attack and damage rolls. On a hit, your claws deal 1d8 slashing damage, which counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, your claws count as pact weapons for warlock class features.

Extra Attack. Starting at 5th level, you can attack twice with your claws, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

When you hit the same creature with your claws twice on your turn, you can make an additional attack using your claws against the target (no action required). On a hit, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of your turn.
	Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you drop to 0 hit points while transformed with your Symbiotic Transformation, you don't fall prone or begin making death saving throws until the end of your next turn. Instead, your Symbiont controls your actions, acting as if you weren't unconscious, attacking any hostile creatures it sees. If you take any damage while at 0 hit points, you instantly fall unconscious and suffer one death saving throw failure. At the end of your next turn, you collapse and begin to make death saving throws as normal.
