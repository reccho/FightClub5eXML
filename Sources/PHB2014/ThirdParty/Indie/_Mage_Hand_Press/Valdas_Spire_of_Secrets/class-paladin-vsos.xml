        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Eternal Night (HB)</name>
        <text>A stealthy, brooding vigilante who probably dresses like a bat.

Paladins who swear the Oath of Eternal Night forgo the lofty standards of conduct and shining armor of their compatriots: instead, they don blackened armor and carry out assassinations, conduct subterfuge, and mete out vigilante justice under cover of night. Such paladins, often called ravens, bind themselves to higher ideals of justice, transcending law and allegiances, so that they can right the wrongs that go unpunished. Every foul action has its consequence, and when no others rise to the challenge, the blade of a raven is not far behind.

Tenets of Eternal Night:
Paladins who swear the Oath of Eternal Night share a sense of moral absolutism and tend to believe in the following core tenets:

None Are Exempt. Even kings and magistrates that write the laws must be held accountable to them.

Good of the Many. The needs of the many always outweigh the needs of the few. It is your charge to protect the weak when the powerful seek to oppress.

Knight of Night. When justice is not done in the light of day, it must be restored in darkness.

Oath Spells:
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

Oath of Eternal Night Spells:
Paladin Level | Spells
3rd | feather fall, longstrider
5th | misty step, pass without trace
9th | fly, haste
13th | dimension door, freedom of movement
17th | passwall, teleportation circle

        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Heresy (HB)</name>
        <text>A blasphemer and revolutionary who has turned their back on their faith.

Heretics come in all forms, but those who swear an Oath of Heresy have borne witness to a great revelation: the prophets of history are false and their clerics have been misled, for the gods have deceived the entire world. Heretics vow to spread their truth to whoever will listen, rebuffing holy men and inquisitors that lack the sense to share in their revolution. Naturally, heretics end their crusades in one of two ways: canonized for revolutionizing the faith, or burned at the stake for their transgressions.
	Heretics might embrace any fundamental truth that goes unrecognized. Many believe the gods are fundamentally false—a trick wrought by celestials or high priests—while others simply profess the non-necessity of deities to gain entry to an afterlife. Others attack fundamental pillars of faith that are erected on prejudicial beliefs, such as priestly orders that disallow people of different races or genders to their own. No matter what truth they embrace, these paladins are empowered by their belief and their oaths (as all paladins are), and so can crusade in active rebellion against the gods.

Tenets of Heresy:
By swearing your oath, you vow to spread truth far and wide according to the following tenets.

Spread The Revolution. Share the truth with everyone. Where truth itself does not dispel the lies, your sword might dispense truth of its own.

Defy Convention. You stand to shatter the laws that seek to contain the truth. Don't dwell on tradition as you seek to remake it.

Speak Truth to Power. Confront the powerful with your truth, and don't let them turn away. Only by embracing the truth can they enact change.

Oath Spells:
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

Oath of Heresy Spells:
Paladin Level | Spells
3rd | illusory script, protection from evil and good
5th | magic weapon, zone of truth
9th | dispel magic, speak with dead
13th | banishment, private sanctum
17th | dispel evil and good, legend lore

On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 psychic damage for each point of your proficiency bonus and is deafened for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and is not deafened.

Each Humanoid within range that can cast 1st-level spells or higher using Wisdom as their spellcasting ability score must also make a Wisdom saving throw. If a creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.
	A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

	• You can use your Blaspheme Channel Divinity as a bonus action without using your Channel Divinity. When you use this ability this way, it deals 4d6 psychic damage on a failed save, and half as much on a success.

        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Revelry (HB)</name>
        <text>A party-paladin who keeps their allies dancing no matter what.

Paladins who swear the Oath of Revelry make a solemn vow to party day and night until their hearts give out. The antithesis of stuffy, lawful crusaders, these emissaries of carousal travel the land, crashing parties and raising hell wherever they raise a glass. Authorities bristle at their arrival, but the youth cheer, for a Party Paladin is always accompanied by a good time.

Tenets of Revelry:
Many paladins who swear the Oath of Revelry choose to abide by the Codicus Brodicus, a doctrine of moral judgments, both foul and fair, about the way one should conduct life and party. In general, paladins who take this oath abide by the following principles:

The Party Don't Stop. Every occasion deserves celebration, and everyone should be invited.

Work Hard, Party Hard. Without planning and effort, a good bacchanal has no momentousness. Bring your "A" game to events.

Fight for Your Right to Party. Those who would stand in your way need to be reminded what it's like to have a good time, or failing that, be circumvented.

Oath Spells:
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

Oath Of Revelry Spells:
Paladin Level | Spells
3rd | charm person, hideous laughter
5th | calm emotions, enhance ability
9th | create food and water, hypnotic pattern
13th | compulsion, freedom of movement
17th | geas, telepathic bond

Up to three creatures can drink from this flask, and each has advantage on the next saving throw it makes before it takes a long rest, after which the buzz wears off. When you take a short rest, any remaining ale becomes nonmagical.

	Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. This effect ends for a creature if you choose to end it on your turn (no action required), or if the creature reattempts the Wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn and succeeds.
	A creature that is dancing spends all its movement tapping its feet and shuffling about without leaving its space. It also has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls that rely on Dexterity.

    <autolevel level="3">
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Storms (HB)</name>
        <text>A wandering paladin pledged to the superstition of storms and the sea.

The Oath of Storms calls paladins to the salty brine and choppy seas, the altar of the raging storm. Paladins who swear this oath embrace the sea's dispassionate neutrality and uphold few core tenets. With rare exceptions, these paladins are directionless crusaders, guided by the winds and tide, and might maintain distant lighthouses, hunt down vicious pirates, or seek undiscovered lands, as the gales dictate. However, storm knights, as they are often called, have a long memory for vengeance and deep penchants for superstition. Always listen to the wisdom of a storm knight, lest the winds turn foul and the ocean tempestuous.

Tenets of the Storm:
Storm knights swear their oaths on sailing superstitions and unspoken laws of the sea, often containing the following principles:

Safe Harbor. Protect sailors and wise captains that respect the laws of the ocean. No gale should break their masts while you are aboard.

Howling Gales. The winds should steer your journey, wherever they might take you. Furthermore, it is proper that the winds should often guide you into storms.

Thunderous Castigation. The fury of the storm demands equal reprisal for all slights, major and minor. Doing otherwise is bad luck.

Oath Spells:
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

Oath of Storms Spells:
Paladin Level | Spells
3rd | fog cloud, thunderwave
5th | gust of wind, hold person
9th | call lightning, wind wall
13th | control water, ice storm
17th | commune with nature, hold monster

        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of the Sun (HB)</name>
        <text>A devotee of sunlight worship, bearing scorching rhetoric and spells.

In the wastes, the sun is a double-edged sword: though it brings light, warmth, and nourishment to the desert's scant greenery, it also burns, blinds, and can destroy those who don't respect it. Paladins who take the Oath of the Sun understand the sun's dual nature, and strive to both bring its light to the darkest reaches of the world and protect those who fall prey to the sun's rays out of happenstance or misfortune.
	Unlike other paladins, most brothers who take the Oath of the Sun belong to a clergy of a sun god of some sort, be it Amaterasu, Apollo, Ra, or any other. They most often serve as templars, protecting their temples from raiders, bandits, and more supernatural threats. They are uniformly good, but have little adherence to laws other than those of their faith.

Tenets of the Sun:
The Oath of the Sun is always taken in public at the height of noon, among the congregation of the paladin's church.

The Sun Rises. The sun rises over the horizon each day, without fail, spreading light over the whole of the world. So should you never fail in your task to spread your faith and knowledge every day.

The Sun Blazes. Under the noonday sun, only the pure may survive for long. Those that fear the sun must see its light, so as to burn away their impurity.

The Sun Sets. The sun must rest each night, and give the world a chance to sleep. So too should you give rest to your fury and righteousness in the service of mercy, though only to those who deserve it.

Oath Spells:
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

Oath Of The Sun Spells:
Paladin Level | Spells
3rd | burning hands, guiding bolt
5th | darkvision, scorching ray
9th | daylight, spirit guardians
13th | fire shield, wall of fire

        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Winter (HB)</name>
        <text>Keeper of a frigid oath, imbued with powers of elemental ice.

The Oath of Winter was originally a concord with an ancient being of ice, Father Winter. With this treatise, a paladin swears to stand vanguard against the cold, protecting the innocent from the ravages of winter's ice and the horrors of the bitter north. Even as Father Winter has faded into obscurity with the march of centuries, the order of paladins sworn to this oath has remained, their concord and duty neverending.

Tenets of Winter:
Your concord with Father Winter, enumerated in your oath, is based on the following principles:

Winter's Snow. Though the winter is long and harsh, it is not altogether evil. Your concord with Father Winter himself is proof of that.

Winter's Wind. With the coming of winter frosts are harsh dangers and frigid creatures not found in the summer. It is your duty to protect the innocent from this peril.

Winter's Throne. Seeking to unseat Father Winter from his throne of ice is to break your vow. No matter the evils of his reign, never break your concord. Seasons change, but your oath does not.

Oath Spells:
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

Paladin Level | Spells
3rd | create or destroy water, fog cloud

        <name>Channel Divinity: Ice Armor (Oath of Winter (HB))</name>
        <text>As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to wreath your armor in a thick layer of protective ice. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to twice your paladin level + your Charisma modifier. You subtract fire damage from your temporary hit points as if you were vulnerable to it, but if fire damage reduces your temporary hit points to zero, you don't subtract the remaining fire damage from your hit points, as your melting ice neutralizes the excess heat.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Channel Divinity: North Wind (Oath of Winter (HB))</name>
        <text>You can use your Channel Divinity as an action to breathe a hoary wind. Each creature within a 30-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 cold damage for each point of your proficiency bonus, and its speed is halved until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much cold damage and its speed is not halved. A creature killed by this ability becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.

        <name>Frigid Aura (Oath of Winter (HB))</name>
        <text>Beginning at 7th level, you emanate bitter cold and draw heat from the room. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to cold and fire damage.
	At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

        <name>Iceflesh (Oath of Winter (HB))</name>
        <text>By 15th level, when you take damage or are blinded, deafened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned, you can use your reaction to freeze the blood in your veins, delaying the effect. The damage or condition is suspended for 1 minute, after which it resumes and affects you normally. This ability pauses the duration of spells that affect only you to impose a condition, and the spellcaster doesn't need to maintain concentration on such a spell until the effect resumes. You can only freeze one condition or instance of damage at a time. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again for 1 minute.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Father Winter (Oath of Winter (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 20th level, you can invite the purest cold upon yourself as an action, becoming an effigy of Father Winter. For the next hour, you gain the following benefits:

	• You are immune to cold damage.

	• When a creature within 5 feet of you deals damage to you while you aren't incapacitated, it takes 2d10 cold damage.

	• You emit a frigid 10-foot-radius aura that freezes the ground around you. The area of this aura is difficult terrain. You can choose for creatures to be unaffected by it.

	• On your turn, you can draw the heat from the room, extinguishing any nonmagical fires you can see within 30 feet (no action required).

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
