        <text>Tavern-smashing warriors known for rocking out and cracking skulls.

The barbarians of the Path of Heavy Metal do not do things by halves. They fight the strongest foes, swing the biggest axes, and play the loudest music. For this reason, any battle they get involved in tends to be noisy, violent, and short.
	Armored only in face paint and studded belts, these fearless hellions are known for screaming their enemies into submission and trashing taverns, though they can also be thoughtful and erudite when not tapping into their primal fury. Away from the battlefield, the "thunderheads" form a tight fraternity, bonded together by absolute commitment to their path and the shared recognition that the life of an adventurer—with its grueling travel, explosive violence, and unfamiliar lodgings—is essentially a never-ending tour.

You can spend 8 hours of work converting a two-handed weapon into an instrument with which you are proficient.

You can increase your Rage damage bonus up to a maximum of twice your proficiency bonus. This increase lasts until you are incapacitated, you are no longer holding your instrument weapon, you miss an attack, or your rage ends.

A nonmagical instrument weapon is completely destroyed, whereas a magical instrument weapon loses its musical components and no longer counts as an instrument weapon.

        <name>Primal Path: Path of the Colossus (HB)</name>
        <text>Grows to enormous size to crush their foes.

The colossus, sometimes known as a war-hulk, is a barbarian of the front lines, hefting massive weapons and sweeping away smaller combatants in their fury. To a war-hulk, strength is the only attribute that matters. Cunning is for the weak; faith is for the weak; speed is for the weak. Victory is for the strong alone, and rage is the purest path to strength. This path is a favorite of goliaths and giants, who step easily into crushing smaller opponents.

Size:
While the Path of the Colossus can be taken by members of any race, the GM can limit access to this path to races of appropriate size. Gnomes and halflings, for example, are poorly suited to throwing boulders, whereas goliaths and minotaurs are well suited to the task.

        <text>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you become a titan in your anger. When you begin a rage, your size doubles in all dimensions and your weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases your size by one category-from Medium to Large, for example-and lasts for the duration of your rage. This size increase doesn't stack with similar size increases, such as from the enlarge/reduce spell. If there isn't enough room for you to double your size, you attain the maximum possible size in the space available. Your weapons also grow to match your new size. While these weapons are enlarged, your attacks with them deal 1d4 extra damage.
	While raging, you can use your action to make a massive swing in a 15-foot line that fits entirely within your reach. Roll a separate attack roll for each target in the line.

Tribal communities exist all across the realms, in all manner of locales and climes. While their customs often change, one steadfast certainty seen time and time again is the reverence for particular animals local to that tribe. These are often wildly varied;
northern tribes may revere the Wolf or the Bear, those of the deserts follow the Hawk or the Jackal, and those of the jungle may aspire to the Ape or the Tiger. It is in this tradition that the Path of the Fin, island warriors capturing the bloodthirsty essence of the great Shark, arose.

If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength modifier instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.
	Starting at 6th level, your bite is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
	When you hit a creature within 5 feet of you with a melee attack, you can use a bonus action to make a bite attack against that creature.

Cantrips. You learn two cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn an additional sorcerer cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

Spell Slots. The Rage Mage Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level or higher. To cast one of these spells, you must be raging and expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher. You know three 1st-level sorcerer spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the evocation or transmutation spells on the sorcerer spell list.
	The Spells Known column of the Rage Mage Spellcasting table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an evocation or transmutation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
	The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.
	Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the sorcerer spells you know with another spell of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an evocation or transmutation spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.

Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

        <text>Starting at 6th level, if you take the Attack action while you are raging and attack recklessly, you can use your bonus action to cast a spell in place of one of your attacks. The spell must have a casting time of 1 action or 1 bonus action.

        <text>By 10th level, you can channel your latent magic to perform spectacular feats of daring. Even when you aren't raging, you can cast the following spells at will, targeting yourself only, without using a spell slot or material components: darkvision, feather fall, jump, and see invisibility.

        <name>Eldritch Explosions (Path of the Rage Mage (HB))</name>
        <text>Beginning at 14th level, you manifest surges of arcane wrath with every strike. Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to create an explosion of energy at a point you choose within 10 feet of you. Each creature other than you within a 10-foot radius of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d6 force damage for each level of the spell slot expended, or half as much on a successful save.

        <name>Primal Path: Path of Tranquility (HB)</name>
        <text>A serene, reactionary warrior who enters a zen-like state in conflict.

Barbarians who follow the Path of Tranquility embrace a zen philosophy of restraint and moderation, much in contrast with their furious brethren. Embraced by the fey and called "the serene," these barbarians are calm, tactical warriors who issue swift retaliation instead of violent assaults. At their pinnacle, the serene are one with nature and with themselves, entering flow states at will to dispatch their foes with dispassionate precision.

        <text>At 10th level, you can chant calming verses to entice, relieve, and protect those around you. You can cast the calm emotions, enthrall, and sanctuary spells once each, without expending spell slots or components, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. You can cast these spells while you are raging. Your spell save DC for these spells is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.
