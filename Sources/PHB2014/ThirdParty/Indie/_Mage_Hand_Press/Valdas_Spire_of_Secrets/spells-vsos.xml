    <text>This spell teleports a creature to your location. Choose a creature within range that is known to you as the target of this spell. An unwilling creature can make a Charisma saving throw to resist this effect. The target is placed at a location of your choice within 30 feet of you. You choose if the target is sitting, standing, prone, or bound with nearby restraints. At the end of the spell's duration, you can choose whether the target remains at your location or is teleported back to the location from which it was abducted

An invisible 40-foot-radius field of magic extends from you, disrupting bullets and causing firearms to malfunction. Within the sphere, attacks with firearms fail, and firearms used to make an attack immediately jam. A jammed firearm can't be used to make an attack until a creature uses its action to clear the weapon malfunction.
	Firearms outside the sphere which are fired into it have disadvantage on attack rolls, and deal only half damage on a hit.

    <text>As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack's normal effects, except that any damage dealt by the attack is lightning damage instead of its normal type.
	Additionally, an arc of lightning jumps to a creature you choose within 5 feet of the target, dealing 1d6 lightning damage.

Cantrip Upgrade: This spell's damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an additional 1d8 lightning damage, and the secondary damage deals an additional 1d6 lightning damage to their targets. Both damage rolls increase by one die at 11th level (2d8 and 3d6) and 17th level (3d8 and 4d6).

Blade cantrips aren't intended to function with spells of 1st level or higher which conjure weapons made entirely of magic. The GM decides if blade cantrips can be cast with such weapons.

It takes no damage from such dismemberment, as long as the cut removing the body part is swift and leaves a clean cut. The target's head remains alive and conscious, and parts connected to it also remain alive. All severed body parts become inanimate, but do not begin decomposition for the spell's duration. Any of the target's severed body parts that are removed during this spells duration can be held back to the stump, which instantly causes the part to knit to the stump, restoring the body part.
	At the end of the duration, severed body parts become permanently severed. The target dies if vital organs have not been reattached to its head.

Each creature whose footprints or fingerprints are detected by the spell is assigned a unique color, but are not otherwise identified. Any creature that moves or touches objects in the area will also leave colorful footprints and fingerprints, which might reveal invisible creatures in the area.

As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make an attack with a ranged weapon, otherwise the spell fails. The attack's projectile is invisible while in flight, and the weapon itself is silent. If the weapon is a firearm, this spell suppresses the smoke and light the weapon produces, making it impossible to see or hear where the shot came from.
	This spell only conceals the first shot you make; any additional shots aren't concealed

You conjure a low cobblestone wall along the ground, a perfect source of cover, at a point you can see within range. The wall is 18 inches thick and is composed of three 5-foot long by 3-foot high segments. Each segment must be contiguous with at least one other segment.
	A Medium creature that hunkers behind the wall has half cover from ranged attacks, and a Small creature that hunkers behind it has three-quarters cover from ranged attacks. A prone creature has total cover behind the wall. The wall can be leapt over without using any additional movement.
	Each segment has AC 10 and 60 hit points. Reducing a segment of the wall to 0 hit points causes it to crumble, destroying it. The wall disappears when all the segments are destroyed or the spell ends.

If the target is a creature, it must make a Charisma saving throw (a willing creature may choose to fail this save), or be cursed to be permanently bound to the chosen location. While cursed, the target can act and move around freely, as long as it remains within 20 feet of the point it is bound to. If the target begins its turn outside of this area, it must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be dragged 60 feet toward the point it was bound to.
	Additionally, if the creature tries to use extraplanar travel, it must make another Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the travel attempt fails and any resources used are wasted. On a success, the curse is suppressed until the creature returns to the plane on which it was bound, at which point the dragging effect resumes.

On a failed save, a creature is frenzied for the duration. When a creature is frenzied, it draws a melee weapon, if it has one.
	A frenzied creature must use its action at the beginning of its turn to attack a creature within its reach. It uses a melee weapon, if it has one, or an improvised weapon or unarmed strike if it doesn't.
	If multiple targets are within the creatures reach, it chooses its target randomly. If there is no target within the creatures reach, it attacks itself, against its own AC, dealing damage as normal on a hit.

	While charmed by this spell, a creature must use its movement on each of its turns to get as close to the water as possible. A charmed creature can't willingly move away from the fountain.

Once a creature has succeeded on a save against this spell, it can't be affected by the same instance of it again.
	If a creature is within 5 feet of the fountain, you can use a bonus action to command the water to lash out at that creature. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the water deals 4d6 bludgeoning damage to the target. If the target is charmed by this spell, it can attempt the saving throw again after taking damage from it.

    <text>A rift opens, pouring forth tons of brick and stonework that neatly and quickly assemble into a vast gothic estate. The estate consists of a manor containing a vault, a spacious 200-by-200-foot courtyard, and a 10-foot high wrought iron fence around the perimeter. Any creature within the estates area is escorted away by harmless but forceful specters.
	You can create any floor plan you like for the manor, but the space can't exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side, or five stories in total, including basements. The manor is adorned with barred windows and decorative gargoyles, but is furnished and decorated as you choose. Once the manor is first created, these details are recorded in the miniature manor used to cast the spell and can't be changed. The manor is staffed by 50 skeletons obedient to you, and contains enough food to serve 50 people each day for a week. The skeletons can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can't attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature.
	The manor contains a 15-foot cube vault, which is an extradimensional space. Items placed within the vault will be present next time you cast this spell.
	The courtyard is drenched in necromantic magic, such that any Humanoid buried in its grounds rises 24 hours later as a ghoul under your control, as per the create undead spell. When the spell is cast, 3 ghouls are animated in the courtyard. These Undead are under your control, but can't leave the estate. They patrol the estate if given no other instructions. Undead can't be turned within the estate.
	The estate crumbles into dust and bone after 7 days, and all items placed within the manor appear safely in the space the manor occupied. If cast in the same place once every 7 days for a year, the estate becomes permanent.

    <text>Spectral skeletal arms emerge from the ground in a 20-foot-radius circle, centered on a point you can see within range. The arms grasp at creatures within the area, except for Undead creatures, which ignore the effects of this spell. The area is difficult terrain.
	When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 necrotic damage, and is dragged by the hands to any unoccupied space within the area that you choose. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is not moved.
	Until the spell ends, you can use your action to force each creature within the area to immediately make a save against this spell.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, its damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.

    <text>When you cast this spell, you stab a black, ritualistically prepared Humanoid heart. The ichor from the heart infects the land with foul necromantic energies, causing up to one hundred piles of bones or corpses of Medium or Small Humanoids within a 1-mile radius to rise from the dead, becoming skeletons or zombies (the GM has the creatures' game statistics). The Undead dig their way out of graves, smash their way out of mausoleums, and tear down cemetery gates.
	The creature that is holding the heart can use its action to issue a general command to all Undead created by the spell, such as to destroy a town or hunt down a particular creature. Only one general command can be issued to the Undead every 24 hours. If not issued a command, the Undead indiscriminately attack living creatures, other than the creature that is holding the heart and creatures designated by it. Once given an order, the Undead continue to follow it to the best of their ability until the task is complete.
	Even while you hold the heart, the Undead aren't directly under your control, and therefore don't count against any limitations of Undead you can command.
	The Undead remain animated until the spell ends. The spell ends if the heart is destroyed (AC 20, HP 10, immunity to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage) or targeted by a dispel magic spell cast as a 9th-level spell. When the spell ends, all Undead animated by it are instantly destroyed, crumpling into a heap. The spell also ends if every Undead created by it is destroyed.

	The hand is an object that has AC 18 and hit points equal to half your hit point maximum. It has immunity to poison and psychic damage. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. The claw doesn't fill its space. When you cast the spell, and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can command the claw to perform one of the following tasks:

Slash: The claw lashes out at a target within 10 feet of itself. Make a melee spell attack using your own spell attack modifier. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 slashing or cold damage (your choice).

Imprison: The claw grabs a Large or smaller creature within 10 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be dragged into the claw's space and restrained for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the restrained target can make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand, but on a failure it takes 1d8 cold damage. While a creature is restrained by the hand, the hand can't imprison or slash another creature. The claw can slash a creature it has restrained.

Release: The claw releases an imprisoned target, which is no longer restrained.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of the Slash and Imprison options increases by 1d8 for each spell slot above 3rd.

The firearm you target jams upon firing. The attack fails, and the firearm is jammed. A jammed firearm can't be used to make an attack until a creature uses its action to clear the weapon malfunction.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can jam one additional firearm within range for each slot level above 2nd.

One ranged weapon you touch becomes enchanted to reload itself automatically. If the weapon has the Loading or Reload property, you can ignore this for the duration. When the weapon's ammunition is depleted, new ammunition teleports from your person to your hand or into the weapon, as appropriate. If the weapon takes an action or longer to reload, it reloads itself at the end of your turn.
	If you aren't carrying sufficient ammunition for the weapon to reload, the spell ends.

    <text>You transform a vegetable into a Large magical carriage, complete with reins and two quasi-real horses. The carriage is luxurious and carries up to six passengers-four within and two atop it at the coach's seat. Creatures within the carriage have total cover from external effects, but can see outside through a pair of windows composed of magical force. While sitting in the coach's seat, a creature can control the carriage, which has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace.
	This spell's duration varies depending upon when and where it was cast. If cast in a location where time passes normally, the spell lasts until the twelfth stroke of the next midnight, however long that may be. Elsewhere, the spell lasts for 24 hours.
	When the spell ends, the carriage's occupants are ejected into adjacent unoccupied spaces, the carriage shrinks back into a vegetable, and the quasi-real horses fade.
	The carriage and horses count as a single object with 12 AC and 100 HP. The spell ends early if the carriage and horses are reduced to 0 hit points.

You can use your hair to perform simple tasks within 10 feet of you, such as manipulating an object, opening an unlocked door or container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents out of a vial. You can cast spells with a range of touch using your hair, out to a range of 10 feet. Your hair returns to its normal length when this spell ends.

On a hit, a creature takes 6d4 acid damage and, if it is wearing nonmagical metal armor or wielding a nonmagical metal shield, you can corrode either its armor or shield. Corroded armor takes a permanent and cumulative - 3 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 is destroyed. A corroded shield is destroyed.
	If you target a nonmagical metal object with this spell that isn't being worn or carried, you corrode and destroy parts of the object you choose that can fit within a 1-foot cube.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 3rd. Additionally, you can destroy one additional cubic foot of a nonmagical object for each slot level above 3rd.

Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. If the creature's soul is free and willing, it manifests as a ghostly specter. This spell fails if the spirit was the target of this spell within the last 10 days.
	Until the spell ends, you can ask up to three questions of the specter. The specter knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the specter is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. There is a 5% chance that this spell contacts the wrong spirit, one which will answer questions untruthfully or ambiguously.

Choose the corpse of a Huge or smaller creature that has been dead for no more than an hour. When you cast this spell, the corpse stands up and can move up to 15 feet and make a single melee slam attack against a target of your choice within its reach, using your spell attack modifier. On a hit, this attack deals bludgeoning damage based on the corpses size: a Tiny corpse deals 1d4, a Small corpse deals 1d6, a Medium corpse deals 1d8, a Large corpse deals 1d10, and a Huge corpse deals 1d12. Once the corpse attacks, it once again crumples into a heap. A corpse targeted by this spell doesn't become an Undead creature.

Cantrip Upgrade: This spell's damage increases as you gain levels. At 5th level, the corpse deals two damage dice according to its size. At 11th level, it deals three damage dice, and at 17th level, it deals four damage dice.

    <text>This spell creates an invisible, shapeless force that performs intellectual tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, an Intelligence of 12, and it can't attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.
	Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The accountant can perform intellectual tasks that a human clerk could do, such as assessing prices, updating accounts, managing inventories, or computing interest. Once you give the command, the accountant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command. The accountant can perform no physical labor, and is not able to lift any object heavier than 1 pound.
	If you command the accountant to perform a task that would move it more than 300 feet away from you, the spell ends.

    <text>When you cast this spell, three tentacles made of water appear around your body for the duration. As part of the action used to cast the spell, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns until the spell ends, you can command one of these tentacles to grapple a Large or smaller creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Strength saving throw or be grappled and restrained by the tentacle. At the end of each of its turns, a restrained target can repeat the saving throw, freeing itself on a success.
	You can grapple as many creatures as you have tentacles. You can use an action or bonus action on your turn to release a grappled creature, or to drag it up to 20 feet in a direction you choose.
	You can also use the tentacles to manipulate objects as an action or a bonus action. Each tentacle can lift up to 100 pounds, and you can command multiple tentacles to work together to lift the same object as part of the same action or bonus action. The tentacles aren't capable of detailed control-for example, they can't open a chest or uncork a bottle. Burning objects are extinguished when a tentacle grabs them.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you gain an additional tentacle for every slot level above 4th.

    <text>You point your finger in a direction and whisper a message of twenty-five words or less, while specifying up to six creatures to be the targets. If a target is in range and in the approximate direction indicated, they (and only they) hear the message carried on the wind. They can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.
	You can cast this spell only when there is a clear path for air to move between you and the targets. The spell doesn't have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings, but is blocked by solid objects and areas of magical silence.

    <text>You create a magical fire that fills ten 5-foot cubes on the ground, which you can arrange as you wish within range. Each cube you place must have a face adjacent to the face of another cube. On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use a bonus action to expand the area of the fire by up to ten additional 5-foot cubes that each have a face adjacent to the face of another cube of fire. The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.
	When a creature moves into the area of fire for the first time or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 8d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save.

    <text>You cause a Tiny white flower to sprout at a point on the ground you can see within range. The flower has an AC of 15, 1 hit point, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to cold damage. During the spell's duration, you can use a bonus action to command it to explode in a shower of ice. Alternatively, the flower will explode if it is reduced to 0 hit points. When the flower explodes, each creature within 30 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d8 cold damage, or half as much on a successful one. The flower withers and dies if it doesn't explode within 24 hours.
	If you cast this spell again while it is active, you can maintain the flower's existence for another 24 hours. You can create a permanent flower by casting this spell on the same flower for seven days.

    <text>You wave your hand and three alabaster feathers, magically sharpened to a razor's edge, appear and orbit around you. When you cast this spell, make a ranged spell attack using one of your feathers against a creature within 120 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 slashing damage. Until the spell ends, while you have feathers remaining, you can make an attack using a feather on each of your turns as an action.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st, up to a maximum of 6d8.
