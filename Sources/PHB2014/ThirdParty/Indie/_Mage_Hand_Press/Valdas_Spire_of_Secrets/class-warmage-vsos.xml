      <text>Cantrips, the class

The undisputed masters of cantrips, warmages turn the most humble spells into deadly weapons via an array of tricks. Play a warmage if you want to be a high-damage spellcaster with deep customization and few spells to learn.

An elf recites the motions for the simplest spell she knows, repeating them until she knows they are perfect. With a single, precise stroke, she unleashes a wave of arcane energy, focused into a searing blue beam.
	A tiefling waves her hands to conjure floating greatswords of humming blue energy that dance about in mesmerizing and deadly arcs. One blade takes on an aspect of fire, and the other lightning, as she begins to cleave through the goblinoid horde.
	Waving a black-and-red checkered banner, a dragonborn king charges into the fore. At his sides are warmages of all houses, a chessboard of elite arcanists, poised to turn the tide of battle.
	The undisputed masters of cantrips, warmages turn the most fundamental types of magic into a deadly and precise art.

    <trait>
      <name>Cantrip Masters</name>
      <text>While other spellcasters aspire to grander and more complex spells, warmages refine and master the most fundamental magic: cantrips. Warmages wield their magic in the same way that a warrior uses a sword, bow, or axe—as weapons to be perfected, not as an unknowable force to be feared. In contrast to sorcerers and wizards, their magic is a trainable skill, one that can be mastered by almost anyone with discipline and aptitude. Therefore, warmages stand among the most fearsome of spellcasters, with only the most rudimentary of spells.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Strategic Geniuses</name>
      <text>Warmages have a long and storied history as masterful strategists and tacticians, both in grand battles and personal skirmishes. If a warmage is outgunned or outnumbered, they'll try to outthink their foes, which works more often than not. Warmages demonstrate an efficient kind of pragmatism, owing perhaps to their ability to solve many problems with just a few magical tools.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Aligned Free Agents</name>
      <text>While some warmages are fully self-taught, the majority join a house: a loose confederation of warmages who practice together and share secrets of the trade. Houses teach invaluable battlefield strategy, but each individual house also touts their own brands of tactics and styles of magical tricks. The House of Knights, for example, emphasizes armor and martial prowess, whereas the House of Kings emphasizes battlefield strategy.
	By way of metaphor, houses that value honor and teamwork above all else brand themselves after games of strategy, whereas those who epitomize self-reliance name themselves for games of chance. This division in the warmage houses is representative of a schism that dates back to the earliest warmage masters. Legend has it that the first two masters separated when one decided to found a college. The other, out of spite, built a casino outside its grounds.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Creating a Warmage</name>
      <text>Warmages come from all walks of life, so as you build yours, consider where you first learned the fundamentals of magic, which you would go on to perfect. You might have picked up cantrips from a fellow adventurer or in the early stages of wizarding training. You could even be self-taught. Choose an Arcane Initiation which best fits your character's history with magic.
	Moreover, consider how you feel about magic as a whole. Are you envious of other spellcasters, or are you confident you could best them regardless? Did you once pine to be a wizard, but found you could never muster enough true magic to form a spell slot?
Did you choose warmagistry to hone your talents to their absolute peak, or did you choose it to wield power no warrior can equal?
	Lastly, consider your prospective warmage House. Though you don't choose one until reaching 3rd level, your aspirations might shape which house you favor the most. If you would like to dabble with greater arcane magic, the House of Bishops is the best fit. If the clashing of swords at the frontlines piques your interest, consider the House of Knights.

Quick Build:
You can make a Warmage quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Make Strength your third highest if you plan to take the House of Knights. Then choose the chill touch, force dart, force weapon, and phantom grapnel cantrips, and the Adventurer Arcane Initiation. Pick any background that emphasizes your magical discipline.</text>

        <name>Multiclass Warmage</name>
        <text>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player's Handbook, here's what you need to know if you choose warmage as one of your classes.

Ability Score Minimum:
As a multiclass character, you must have at least the following ability score(s) to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a warmage.

	• Intelligence 13

Proficiencies Gained:
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of your new class's starting proficiencies, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a warmage.

	• Armor: light armor
	• Weapons: none
	• Tools: none

Spellcasting (Warmage):
The Spellcasting class feature from the warmage class doesn't grant you spell slots. If you have the Spellcasting class feature from the warmage class and the Spellcasting class feature from another class, don't add your warmage levels when determining your total spell slots on the Multiclass Spellcaster table.

Source:	Valda's Spire of Secrets p. 272 (Homebrew)</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Multiclass Features</name>
        <text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does).
	Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared:
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.
	Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
	If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots:
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
	If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.
	For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic:
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

        <name>Spellcasting</name>
        <text>At 1st level, you begin to learn the simple, yet potent, brand of spellcasting for which warmages are known.

Cantrips. You know four cantrips of your choice from the warmage spell list. You learn additional warmage cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warmage table.
	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warmage cantrips you know and replace it with another warmage cantrip.

Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your warmage spells, since you learn your spells through practice and mental discipline. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warmage spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Spellcasting Focus. You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warmage spells.

Blade Cantrips:
When a warmage uses a cantrip which calls for a melee weapon attack, such as burning blade or frigid blade, they can apply their class features and warmage tricks to the weapon damage dealt.
	Furthermore, blade cantrips aren't intended to function with spells of 1st level or higher which conjure weapons made entirely of magic. The GM decides if blade cantrips can be cast with such weapons.

Adventurer. You picked up your magic informally by traveling with a dozen different mages over the years. You learn the mage hand and ray of frost cantrips.

Circus Performer. You learned a few simple tricks to participate in a sideshow or circus act. You learn the dancing lights and minor illusion cantrips.

Eldritch Event. An influx of insidious magic left an imprint on you. You learn the chill touch and message cantrips.

Mercenary. You mastered the fundamentals of war magic to engage in battle with similarly armed arcanists. You learn the arc blade and true strike cantrips.

Temple. A monastery or temple educated you in the ways of gentle healing magic. You learn the sacred flame and spare the dying cantrips.

Tower Apprentice. You apprenticed under a spellcaster for some time, who taught you the fundamentals of arcana. You learn the prestidigitation and shocking grasp cantrips.

Self-Taught. You taught yourself all the fundamentals of magic from a dusty old tome or abandoned scroll. You learn the fire bolt and light cantrips.

Survival. To survive in the wilderness, you taught yourself to cast simple spells. You learn the druidcraft and shillelagh cantrips.

6 | A 5-foot-radius sphere of butterflies, insects, or doves fills a location you choose within 60 feet of you, heavily obscuring the area until the start of your next turn.
7 | You gain 7 temporary hit points and keep the Dice of Fate instead of giving them to the GM.
8 | You become invisible until the end of your next turn, as per the invisibility spell.
9 | An object within 60 feet of you chosen by the GM explodes, dealing no damage to you or your allies, and dealing 3d6 fire damage to one creature caught in the blast.
10 | You teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Each creature within 5 feet of the destination must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 2d6 force damage.

12 | You cast lightning bolt and can add the Dice of Fate to the damage roll.

Battle Dice. You have two battle dice, which are d8s. A battle die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended battle dice when you finish a short or long rest, or when you roll initiative. Your battle die changes and more battle dice become available when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the table below.

Battle Dice:
Warmage Level | Battle Dice
3rd | 2d8
7th | 3d8
13th | 3d10
19th | 4d10

Using Battle Dice. Once per turn, you can expend a battle die to perform a stratagem of your choice. Your stratagem options are detailed in the 'Stratagems' feature.

Saving Throws. When a stratagem calls for a saving throw to resist its effects, the saving throw DC is equal to your spell save DC.

Blitz. As a bonus action, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can expend one battle die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position. Choose a friendly creature within 60 feet that can see or hear you. That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.

Check. When you hit a creature with an attack, you can expend one battle die as a bonus action to force that creature to flee. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. A creature that is immune to being frightened automatically succeeds on this saving throw. On a failed save, the target must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move up to half its speed directly away from you.

Flash Of Brilliance. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check, you can expend one battle die to add it to the check. You can choose to use this stratagem after the ability check is rolled but must decide before the GM says whether the check succeeds or fails.

Gambit. When you hit a creature with an attack, you can expend one battle die to give your allies an opening. The next creature other than you to make an attack against the target adds the battle die to their attack roll.

Mystic Counsel. You can use a bonus action and expend one battle die to give counsel to a creature that can hear you within 30 feet of you. Once in the next minute when the creature makes a saving throw against a spell it can choose to roll the battle die and add the result to the saving throw.

Stalemate. When you hit a creature with an attack, you can expend one battle die as a bonus action to hold that creature in place. Until the end of its next turn, the target can't willingly move unless it first takes the Disengage action.

Your skill with the mage hand cantrip allows you to use it as an extension of yourself. When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can use one of the following effects with the hand:

Press: The hand pushes against a Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. Choose a direction away from that creature. Every foot of movement in that direction while the hand is pressing against it costs the creature 1 extra foot of movement. The hand continues to push against the target until the spell ends or you use your bonus action to use a different effect with the hand.

Punch: The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 force damage.

Seize: The hand grabs a Small or smaller creature and attempts to grapple it. The creature must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (its choice) against your spell save DC or be grappled by the hand. The hand continues to grapple the target until the target uses an action to break the grapple on its turn, the spell ends, or you use your bonus action to use a different effect with the hand.

When you create the image of an object in an unoccupied space using the minor illusion cantrip, you can fill it with fibers of shadowstuff, causing it to become partially real. No matter what form the semi-real object takes, it still must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. It has AC 10 and 5 hit points, and it weighs 5 pounds. You can only have one semi-real illusion at a time. While this semi-real object exists, the cantrip requires your concentration.
	The illusion can't replicate a creature, but it can deal damage to a creature within its 5-foot cube. If the illusion is of an object that can deal damage, a creature that enters the object's 5-foot cube or begins its turn there must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 damage of a type appropriate to the illusion. This damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6). This damage can't trigger Warmage Edge or any warmage tricks.

	For example, fire bolt deals 3d10 damage. You can choose to target three creatures and deal 1d10 damage to each creature, or you can target two creatures, dealing 1d10 damage to one creature and 2d10 damage to the other creature, or you can target one creature for 3d10 damage.

    <text>Whenever you deal lightning damage to a hostile creature with a warmage cantrip, you can sap part of the energy into a charge, which clings to your body until the start of your next turn. While charged, you can use your reaction when you take damage from a creature you can see within 5 feet of you to deal lightning damage equal to half your warmage level to the creature.
