      <text>Invention, the class

Master artisans and inventors, craftsmen can forge masterwork equipment and devise entirely new weapons on the fly. Play a craftsman if you want to experiment with a comprehensive array of weapon properties to invent entirely new weapons and armor.

Note for the GM:
The craftsman, captain, and necromancer aren't recommended for first-time players. The captain and necromancer command more than one character at once, while the craftsman requires careful reading and understanding of their properties.
	Furthermore, discuss with the players before the campaign how best to approach martyrs, which have strong religious themes and references to blood, and necromancers, which are often overtly evil and might pose a challenge to roleplay.

A burly dwarf brings her hammer down on a glowing hunk of steel, launching a shower of sparks into the air. The room resonates with the sound of metal impacting metal, while the bright, hot piece of steel in her tongs begins to take shape.
	An elf threads a needle with an impossibly thin metallic wire, preparing to set the stitches into what looks to be leather armor, but made of dragon's hide.
	Once satisfied with the measurements, he proceeds with a flurry of dexterous needlework.
	A gnome with an intricate set of goggles examines the stock for her latest work: a portable ballista. She examines the gearing and loading crank, ensures the tension on the bowstring, and scans the bolt rail for imperfections. She smiles, for she knows her work is without flaw.
	Craftsmen are virtuoso artisans and genius inventors. Not content merely creating masterwork pieces of weapons and armor, they invent and engineer ingenious devices and singularly deadly weapons.

      <text>Artisans of all types are an integral part of every culture: buildings must be erected, pots must be sent to the kiln, tools must be forged. Despite their pervasiveness, master craftsmen are as rare as they are prized. These artisans, creators, and inventors can smith items of mythic quality, and can solve most any problem simply by using the right tool and the appropriate amount of force.</text>

      <text>Adventuring craftsmen come in many varieties, but nearly all leverage their advanced knowledge of metallurgy, smelting, and construction to forge arms and armor rarely seen, even by other adventurers. The smiths test their schematics and designs themselves, building prototypes and experimental gear that can later be refined into mass-produced items.</text>

      <name>Creating a Craftsman</name>
      <text>When you create your craftsman, the most important thing to consider is your crafting expertise. Though all craftsmen of adventuring stock can stitch leather armor, forge weapons, and tinker with magic items, only those who dedicate themselves to a single craft can attain legendary works. Each type of craftsman, from the practical to the wildly eccentric, have their place, but no craftsman can specialize in everything.
	Moreover, few craftsmen are self-taught. Most learn the finer points of their craft under the tutelage of a master artisan (whether or not their master was a craftsman, in the conventional sense). Did you study under a master, and if so, what drove you to apprentice underneath them?
	Lastly, consider how you view your work. Are you pragmatic, viewing your creations as tools to serve a purpose? Are you artistic, striving to craft pieces of unrivaled beauty and perfection? Or are you experimental, tinkering and building with wild abandon to break new ground and innovate on established norms?

Quick Build:
You can make a craftsman quickly by following these suggestions. Make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Intelligence. Next, select Athletics and Investigation as your skills. Finally, choose a background befitting of your history of craftsmanship.</text>

        <name>Starting Craftsman</name>
        <text>As a 1st-level Craftsman, you begin play with 10 + your Constitution modifier hit points.

You are proficient with the following items, in addition to any proficiencies provided by your race or background.

	• Armor: all armor, shields
	• Weapons: simple weapons, martial weapons
	• Tools: all artisan's tools
	• Skills: Choose 2 from Arcana, Athletics, History, Investigation, Medicine, Perception, and Persuasion

You begin play with the following equipment, in addition to any equipment provided by your background.

	• A set of craftsman's tools
	• A shield and (a) chain mail, (b) leather armor, or (c) scale mail
	• A dagger and (a) a warhammer or (b) any simple weapon
	• (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) a short bow and 20 arrows
	• A dungeoneer's pack

If you forgo this starting equipment, as well as the items offered by your background, you start with 5d4 × 10 gp to buy your equipment.

Craftsman's Tools:
As a craftsman, you carry a set of craftsman's tools, a combined toolkit that covers a broad range of applications. You can use a set of craftsman's tools for any ability check you would make with any set of artisan's tools. A set of craftsman's tools costs 75 gp.

        <name>Multiclass Craftsman</name>
        <text>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player's Handbook, here's what you need to know if you choose craftsman as one of your classes.

Ability Score Minimum:
As a multiclass character, you must have at least the following ability score(s) to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a craftsman.

	• Strength or Dexterity 13
	• Intelligence 13

Proficiencies Gained:
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of your new class's starting proficiencies, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a craftsman.

	• Armor: light armor, medium armor, shields
	• Weapons: none
	• Tools: all artisan's tools.

Craftsman Multiclassing:
Unlike other classes, a multiclass craftsman gains additional proficiencies with higher levels in the class. A multiclass character with 1 level in craftsman has proficiency with all artisan's tools, light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons, and exotic weapons. With 2 levels in craftsman, the character also gains proficiency with heavy armor, and with 3 in craftsman, they gain proficiency with exotic armor.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Multiclass Features</name>
        <text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does).
	Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared:
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.
	Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
	If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots:
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
	If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.
	For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic:
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

        <text>Starting at 1st level, you gain proficiency with exotic weapons and exotic armor, which are unconventional, yet effective items with which no other class is proficient. If a feature or effect grants proficiency with a weapon or suit of armor, it doesn't grant proficiency with exotic weapons or exotic armor, unless otherwise stated.

        <name>Active Crafting</name>
        <text>Also at 1st level, you can craft one nonmagical item each day when you take a long rest, without losing the benefits of a long rest. You pay half the item's gold piece cost in materials, up to 25 gp. If an item costs more than 25 gp in materials, you can finish the item by working on it for multiple days, spending 25 gp each day until the item is completed.
	As you gain levels in this class, your crafting speed increases, allowing you to spend more on materials for each day of crafting, as shown in the Active Crafting column of the Craftsman table.
	Items you craft using this feature are worth half their gold piece cost when sold. This means that you can sell an item to refund its cost in materials, but not to make a profit.

2nd | 25 gp

      <feature>
        <name>Masterwork</name>
        <text>At 2nd level, you begin to learn the deeper intricacies of weapon and armor craftsmanship.

Masterwork Equipment:
As a craftsman, you are capable of creating weapons and armor of the utmost quality; such creations are known as masterwork items. To create a masterwork version of an item, add 50 gp to the cost in materials you pay to craft the item. Masterwork weapons you create have a +1 bonus to attack rolls. A magic weapon that adds a bonus to your attack and damage rolls doesn't add this bonus to attack rolls.

Masterwork Properties:
Properties | Craftsman Level | Cost
Apprentice | 2nd | —
Journeyman | 5th | 100 gp
Master | 11th | 250 gp
Legendary | 17th | 400 gp

Masterwork Properties:
Masterwork weapons and armor can be modified with masterwork properties, advanced modifications that transform them into truly unique weapons and armor. Masterwork properties are separated into 4 levels: Apprentice, Journeyman, Master, and Legendary. You can apply any number of Apprentice properties to a masterwork weapon, or up to three Apprentice properties to a masterwork suit of armor. Additionally, you can apply one Journeyman, one Master, and one Legendary property to each masterwork item.
	If you add a Master or Legendary property to an item, only you can use it.

Modifying Equipment:
Using the Active Crafting feature, you can modify a weapon or suit of armor when you take a long rest. This allows you to do the following:

Improving Equipment. You can make any nonmagical weapon or suit of armor masterwork for a cost of 50 gp in materials.

Adding Masterwork Properties. Adding masterwork properties of Journeyman level or higher requires a cost in gold pieces and also requires you to be of a high enough level in this class, as shown in the Masterwork Properties table. When you learn a new level of masterwork properties, you can apply a property from that level to a masterwork item at no cost.
	Check the Weapons Exceptions sidebar later in this chapter before adding masterwork properties to a weapon.
	Whenever you modify the properties of a masterwork weapon, you can change its damage type to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, if its damage was already one of these types.

Removing Properties. You can remove any properties of a masterwork item, including those a weapon had when you first created it. You can't remove a property from an item that is a prerequisite for another of the item's properties. If you replace a property of Journeyman level or higher with a property of the same level over the same long rest, you can do so without an additional cost in materials.

Crafting Ability:
Intelligence is the primary ability you use when crafting items. You use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for items that you craft.

	Masterwork save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Downtime Crafting:
Any character can craft nonmagical items in their downtime; the craftsman is simply better at it. To craft an item, a character requires three things:

	• Materials. In most cases, the raw materials for an item can be obtained for half the item's gold piece cost. This cost can fluctuate depending on the character's current circumstances, contacts, or access to materials.

	• Tools. You must have a set of appropriate artisan's tools and proficiency with them to craft an item. Occasionally, an item might call for an entire workshop or other special tools.

	• Time. The time required to craft an item is measured against its cost in materials. A character makes progress toward crafting an item equal to 5 gp for each day of downtime, completing their work when this amount exceeds the item's cost in materials. As a craftsman, you work faster than a normal character, and make progress equal to 10 gp progress each day.

You can sell any item you craft during your downtime for its total gold piece cost. As such, if you run a shop or craft items during your downtime purely to make profit, you can make 5 gp per day, assuming you sell all of your items.

Modified Weapons:
Once you modify a weapon's properties, it may no longer resemble its original function or profile. The GM decides if a modified weapon still counts as its base form for characters that have proficiency with it and for features which refer to a specific type of weapon (as opposed to a category of weapons, such as simple or martial weapons).

Weapon Exceptions:
Some weapons, in the name of verisimilitude, have unusual balancing that makes them slightly stronger or weaker compared to weapons a craftsman might usually craft. If you modify one of these weapons as a craftsman, first remove any of the weapon's Special properties, then check following rules:

Assault Rifle: Increase the weapon's damage to 2d6 + 1 and decrease its reload to 10.

Bayonet, Whip: Increase the weapon's damage to 1d6.

Blowgun, Bolas, Bomb, Net: This weapon can't be modified by masterwork properties.

Boomerang, Doomerang, Throwing Dagger: Add the Aerodynamic masterwork property.

Catchpole, Trident: Increase the weapon's damage to 1d8.

Gatling Gun: Increase the weapon's damage to 2d8 + 1, and decrease its reload to 10.

Handaxe: Decrease the weapon's damage to 1d4.

Handgun, Revolver: Decrease the weapon's range to 50/200 ft.

Hunting Rifle: Increase the weapon's damage to 2d6 + 1.

Javelin: Decrease the weapon's range to 20/60 ft.

Lance: Add the Two-Handed property and decrease the weapon's damage to 1d8.

Light Cannon: Increase the weapon's damage to 2d12 + 1.

Longbow: Decrease the weapon's range to 100 / 400 ft.

Magnum, Explosive Magnum: Add the Two-Handed property and increase the weapon's range to 100/400 ft.

Musket, Volley Gun: Increase the weapon's damage to 2d8 + 1.

Parlor Gun: Increase the weapon's damage to 2d4 + 1.

Rocket Launcher: Increase the weapon's damage to 2d12 + 1 and add the Mounted property.

You can use your action to retrieve a piece of nonmagical gear from your belt, pack, cart, or wherever you keep your tools, even if you didn't have it in your inventory before. The item's gold piece cost can be up to 50 gp. You can't use this feature to produce a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or potion. An item retrieved in this way becomes lost in your inventory and vanishes when you finish a long rest.
	You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

        <text>Magical craftsmen that forge mundane steel into magic items.

While most seasoned spellcasters will enchant a handful of magic items over the course of their careers, artisans belonging to the Guild of Arcane Maesters seek to become true masters of magic item creation. They rightly take seriously the forging of such powerful relics: each creation must be a masterwork in its own right to contain the potent magic woven into them. Despite laboring for months or even years to perfect their creations, seasoned maesters are always seen to be laden with dozens of magic items, attuned to a handful of rings, and carrying a wand of magic missiles, just in case.

You build a miniature furnace into this armor, as well as layers of heat-dispersing materials. While wearing this armor, you have immunity to fire damage.
	Additionally, when you take the Dash action, you can choose to cast the wall of fire spell without using a spell slot or spell components as part of that action. The wall appears at the end of your turn.
	Instead of creating a straight or ringed wall of fire, the wall follows the path along the ground over which you moved on your turn, up to a distance of 60 feet.

For centuries, the pinnacle of mechanized vehicles was the apparatus of the crab, a singular device capable of exploring inhospitable environments, from the sea floor to lava-strewn volcanic fields. However, ambitious craftsmen from the Mechanauts' Guild have drawn up designs for a new vehicle, mightier and more customizable than the old apparatus. This device is a walking tank, equipped with savage fists, scuttling legs, and climate control enhancements—a vehicle to dwarf all others, a true feat of engineering.

        <name>Mechanaut's Apparatus (Mechanauts' Guild)</name>
        <text>At 3rd level, you complete the frame of a Mechanaut's Apparatus, with ample room for upgrades and improvements. Its blueprints are based on the apparatus of the crab, but you can model your apparatus after any Beast or as a Humanoid figure.

Apparatus Statistics. The statistics of your apparatus are given in the Mechanaut's Apparatus stat block. The apparatus's Armor Class is based on your Intelligence modifier and its hit points are based on your craftsman level.

Customizing the Apparatus. Your apparatus comes with two installed masterwork weapons, which you can modify with masterwork properties CRAFTSMAN or replace with different weapons when you finish a long rest. Only one installed weapon can be ranged. Furthermore, you can only load or reload an installed ranged weapon by using your action while you are inside the apparatus (or two actions if the weapon has the Mounted property). Your apparatus is always proficient with its installed weapons, and can use masterwork weapons with Master and Legendary properties.

Repairing the Apparatus. When your apparatus drops to 0 hit points, it can't move or act, but can be repaired. You can spend 1 minute restoring the apparatus's ability to move at half speed, which it loses if it takes damage again before it is repaired.
	You can repair your apparatus at the end of a short rest by spending your Hit Dice, causing it to regain hit points as if it had taken a short rest. When you finish a long rest, you can repair your apparatus, causing it to regain all its hit points. You are always considered to have enough materials to repair your apparatus. If your apparatus is lost, you can build a new one for 400 gp.

Entering and Exiting the Apparatus. A creature can enter or exit the apparatus by using half its movement. While within the apparatus, a creature has total cover from effects originating outside of it. Your armor properties have no effect while you are
within the apparatus. Only one Medium or Small
creature can be in the apparatus at a time.

Piloting the Apparatus. A creature that is inside the apparatus can pilot it; the apparatus acts on its pilot's turn. Any creature piloting the apparatus can command it to move on its turn (no action required). When you pilot the apparatus, you can use your action to command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. You can also command it to use a reaction, using your own reaction to do so.
	Only one creature can pilot the apparatus at a time. The pilot takes half of the amount of damage the apparatus takes.
	While you are outside the apparatus, you can command the apparatus to wait or follow you. While following, it moves on its turn to remain within 30 feet of you.

Attacking with the Apparatus. The apparatus attacks with its integrated weapons as if you were wielding them, and uses your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier (your choice) for its attack and damage rolls, using the same modifier for both. When you take the Attack action, it makes the same number of attacks you normally would.

On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 slashing damage, and if it is Large or smaller, it becomes trapped, rendering it unable to move. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't trapped. The trapped creature or another creature within 5 feet of it can use its action to make a Strength check against your Masterwork save DC, freeing the trapped creature on a success. A Huge or larger creature that failed its saving throw rips the trap from its mounting the next time it moves.

    <text>Components: Masterwork ranged weapon with the Loading or Reload property that doesn't have the Tension property.
You can apply any number of Apprentice properties to a masterwork weapon.

This weapon loses the Ammunition, Loading, and Reload properties, as well as any damage die increases associated with those properties. (It regains these properties if you later remove Blaster.) It gains the Blaster property and deals radiant damage instead of its normal damage type. If this weapon wasn't previously a firearm, its damage die increases by four steps and moves to two damage dice, if possible. The weapon's normal range increases by 20 feet and its long range increases accordingly.

Blaster: A weapon with the Blaster property is a ranged weapon that requires no ammunition. Blasters are considered firearms for the purpose of class features and abilities. Like firearms, you don't add your ability score modifier to blasters' damage rolls.

Damage Steps:
If a masterwork property increases or decreases a weapon's damage, it is moved up or down one step on the following scale, down to a minimum of 1d4:

	1d4 → 1d6 → 1d8 → 1d10 → 1d12 or 2d6

Changing Weapon Ranges:
A ranged weapon's long range is either three times its normal range or four times its normal range, depending on the type of projectile it fires. When a masterwork property changes a weapon's normal range, change the long range by three or four times the amount, as appropriate to the weapon.
	You can't apply a weapon property if it would reduce a ranged weapon's normal range to 0 feet, and you can't remove the Ammunition or Thrown properties from a ranged weapon.

Blaster Notes:
In high-tech settings, such as the Dark Matter campaign setting, many weapons release blasts of energy instead of conventional projectiles. The Blaster property replaces the Firearm property in such settings. All rules that apply to firearms apply to blasters as well.
	For the purpose of applying masterwork properties, blasters count as ranged weapons with the Ammunition and Reload properties. You can also apply the Overheat and Variable properties listed below to blasters.

Further increases add a +1 bonus to the weapon's damage roll.
	If the weapon being modified has 2 damage dice (such as a greatsword or a firearm), the scale is instead:

	2d4 → 2d4 + 1 → 2d6 → 2d6+1 → 2d8 → 2d8+1 → 2d10 → 2d10 + 1 → 2d12
