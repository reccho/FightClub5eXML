        <text>Strikes with flurries of combos, uppercuts, and ki blasts.

The Way of Street Fighting is an urban discipline founded on necessity, whose blindingly fast, unique brand of martial arts has been honed and perfected in back-alley brawls and tournaments alike. Monks who adopt this relatively new technique place comparatively little value on spiritual enlightenment and karmic balance; the thrill of split-second timing, rapid combos, and decisive knock-outs drive them to become the best combatants in the world.

        <text>At 11th level, you have memorized and mastered patterns of discrete movements that unlock your ki, allowing you to use the following special moves:

Ki Blast. You can channel your ki into a blast of energy. As an action, you can expend 2 ki points to make a ranged spell attack (using your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus) against a creature you can see within 120 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 6d8 + half your monk level.

Uppercut. Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to perform an uppercut. Make an unarmed strike as a bonus action. On a hit, if the target is Large or smaller and doesn't have all of its hit points, it takes damage as normal and is then knocked off its feet and falls prone.

Whirlwind Strike. Whenever you make a melee attack on your turn against a creature you can see, you can spend 1 ki point to lunge up to 15 feet toward your target before making the attack. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. You can perform this movement even if it causes you to travel through the air, though you fall after making the attack if you have nothing holding you aloft.

Soul Arrow. When you take the Attack action on your turn to make a ranged weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to fire a soul arrow for the first attack. A soul arrow is a normal arrow of its type which ignores half and three-quarters cover and deals extra damage equal to your Wisdom modifier on a hit. Firing a soul arrow doesn't consume ammunition.

        <text>A repentant ascetic, expert in enduring and inflicting pain upon others.

The Way of the Flagellant teaches an extreme, sometimes heretical, view of asceticism: peace comes through suffering, purity through pain. Its practitioners shun all indulgences and embrace pain to harness their ki, isolating themselves further from the material world. As such, these monks often carry their eponymous flails and whips to use on both themselves and their foes. Their pain is a mortal penitence and an act of focusing, letting them block out all else and manipulate their ki with expert intent.

You can choose to take one or more d4s of slashing damage. For each d4 of slashing damage you choose to take, you gain advantage on one attack you make before the end of your turn. Each attack must use a monk weapon or unarmed strike. This ability has no effect if you reduce or avoid taking the slashing damage.

Branding Palm. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 ki point as a bonus action to brand the creature. The next attack that hits a branded creature within the next minute deals an extra 2d8 fire damage. At 11th level, this damage increases to 3d8, and at 17th level, this damage increases to 4d8.

Electroshock Strike. Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to cast the shocking grasp cantrip as a bonus action. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

Scissorhand Technique. If you deal slashing damage to a creature with a monk weapon or unarmed strike, you can spend 1 ki point to give the target a bleeding wound. Constructs, Oozes, and Undead can't get bleeding wounds. A creature loses 1d6 hit points at the start of each of its turns for each of its bleeding wounds unless it uses an action to staunch the bleeding of all of its wounds. While a target is bleeding, it can't regain lost hit points. A creature can have a number of bleeding wounds up to your proficiency bonus.

        <text>A masked wrestler of unmatched strength and ego.

When you put on your mask, you're not an ordinary (albeit impossibly handsome) commoner anymore; you're the greatest wrestler the world has ever known. You'll wrestle anyone—or anything-that comes within arm's reach. Sometimes you wrestle inanimate objects just to prove that you can. That one time you wrestled an owlbear? Totally happened. For real.
	People come from all around to get a shot against you, to unmask you and take your championship belt. Everyone wants to beat the champ; too bad no one ever will.

Mask and Wrestling Gimmick:
People know you far and wide by the mask that you wear. Whenever you are in combat (and in much of your time outside combat) you wear a tight mask, made of leather or cloth, ornately decorated in a theme of your choice. Your mask's theme must tie into your wrestling persona, which you adopt to stir crowds and build your legend. For example, your mask might include furs to look like a werewolf, a fin to resemble a shark, or dark colors to evoke an executioner's garb.
