    <trait>
      <name>Martyr</name>
      <text>Sacrifice, the class

Chosen by the gods to complete a task, martyrs are set upon a harsh, predestined path, requiring constant sacrifice. Martyrs use their hit points to fuel their divine abilities, and can supernaturally resist death's embrace. Play a martyr if you want to experience the push and pull of sacrificing hit points for massive damage, only to heal moments later.

Note for the GM:
The craftsman, captain, and necromancer aren't recommended for first-time players. The captain and necromancer command more than one character at once, while the craftsman requires careful reading and understanding of their properties.
	Furthermore, discuss with the players before the campaign how best to approach martyrs, which have strong religious themes and references to blood, and necromancers, which are often overtly evil and might pose a challenge to roleplay.

Squalid masses draw close around a young dwarf in spotless clothing. He touches each person in turn, healing injuries, curing illnesses, and restoring hope.
	A ragged tiefling speaks in a crowded square. As if in response, dark clouds gather over her head and the earth trembles at her words.
	A mad king spits and swears from his throne at imperial guards who have fled or been slain. A lone dragonborn stands before him, solemnly preparing herself for divinely demanded regicide.
	Martyrs are implements of the gods, handpicked to spill their blood in service of a divine cause. Such an end is inevitable, for once a martyr is chosen, their fate is fixed in the heavens.

    <trait>
      <name>Fated to Die</name>
      <text>Martyrs are chosen by the gods as prophets, oracles, great priests, and liberators. However, regardless of how much good they might accomplish in their lives, the end must always be the same: a glorious death, to be remembered in legend.
	No matter the circumstance, a martyr cannot avoid their destiny. While some martyrs gladly accept their holy approbation, others struggle against it. However, from the moment the gods choose their martyr, they shall intervene in the martyr's fate, pulling them inexorably toward their cause. The gods will settle for a lesser martyr if they must—if the one chosen is unwilling to follow their path —but they always prefer to uplift their martyr to the heights of sainthood before their inevitable demise.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Blood of the Martyr</name>
      <text>Martyrs grow more powerful the closer they are to death, and those that spill their own blood evoke waves of divine energy. In the view of the gods, such hardship is necessary to lay the foundation for a story that will live on in history.
	Paradoxically, martyrs are protected from death's precipice even as they are edged closer toward it. Every torment and persecution suffered by them is weighed with equal moments of respite offered by the gods. The gods do not mean to kill their charge early;
a martyr should meet their fate only at the preordained time and place.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Quiet Martyrdom</name>
      <text>Not all stories of martyrdom end in dramatic confrontations with implacable foes. Occasionally a martyr's sacrifice achieves a peaceful conclusion and satisfies the gods without costing their life. Nevertheless, the stories of these martyrs still come to a close—they do not continue adventuring once their ultimate goal has been fulfilled. Perhaps they might retire to a distant hermitage, wander into the desert, or simply disappear into a crowd, never to be seen again.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Creating a Martyr</name>
      <text>As you create a martyr, think about the moment you were chosen by the gods and your burden was placed upon you. Were you visited by an angelic host or a god disguised as a mortal? Did you quietly hear a divine voice in your ear, as stigmata formed on your body? Was your soul violently dragged to the Upper (or Lower) Planes for an audience with the gods?
	Consider the life you led before you were ordained for martyrdom. Were you a wicked soul, purified and redeemed to undergo this task? Were you already a warrior, adventurer, or cleric in service of the gods? Also consider how you reacted. Did you accept the task and your inevitable destiny, or did you run from it? Are you still running?

Quick Build:
To build a martyr quickly, follow these suggestions: Constitution should be your highest ability score. Your next highest ability score should be Strength if you choose a Burden, such as the Burden of Revolution, which focuses on melee combat, or Wisdom if you choose one focused on spellcasting. Choose any background.</text>

        <name>Multiclass Martyr</name>
        <text>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player's Handbook, here's what you need to know if you choose martyr as one of your classes.

Ability Score Minimum:
As a multiclass character, you must have at least the following ability score(s) to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a martyr.

	• Constitution 13
	• Wisdom 13

Proficiencies Gained:
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of your new class's starting proficiencies, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a martyr.

	• Armor: light armor, medium armor, shields
	• Weapons: simple weapons, martial weapons
	• Tools: none

Spellcasting (Martyr):
The Spellcasting class feature from the martyr class requires you to lose hit points to create spell slots. If you have have the Spellcasting class feature from the martyr class and the Spellcasting class feature from any other class (except for the warmage), you can spend spell slots from the other class to cast martyr spells you have prepared, and can lose hit points to create spell slots to cast spells you know or have prepared from the other class. You don't add your martyr levels when determining your total spell slots on the Multiclass Spellcaster table.

Source:	Valda's Spire of Secrets p. 272 (Homebrew)</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Multiclass Features</name>
        <text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does).
	Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared:
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.
	Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
	If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots:
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
	If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.
	For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic:
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

        <name>Ordained Death</name>
        <text>As a martyr, you have been predestined by the gods to perish for a great cause; there is no greater glory in death, and no greater joy in the afterlife. However, it is not yet your time. Starting at 1st level, when you fall to 0 hit points and begin to make death saving throws, you must fail 5 saving throws to die. Additionally, if a spell has the sole effect of restoring you to life (but not undeath), the caster doesn't need material components to cast the spell on you.

      <feature>
        <name>Mortal Burden</name>
        <text>Martyrs are created and driven forth to right an inexorable wrong in the world. On this quest, they are a direct instrument of the gods, and no matter how hard they try, they cannot escape the burden of their duty.

Beginning at 1st level, you are fated to perish in the name of a great ideal, cementing your name alongside others who have done the same. Choose a Mortal Burden, detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level, and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.

Burden Spells:
Each burden has a list of associated spells that you gain at the martyr levels specified in the burden description. Once you gain access to a burden spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.
	If you gain a burden spell that doesn't appear on the martyr spell list, the spell is nonetheless a martyr spell for you.

      <feature>
        <name>Spellcasting</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you can leverage the power of your suffering to cast divine magic.

Casting Spells:
To cast one of your martyr spells of 1st level or higher, you must lose hit points to create and expend a spell slot greater than or equal to that spell's level. The number of hit points is listed on the Hit Points Spellcasting table and can't be reduced or avoided. You don't make Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on spells as a result of losing these hit points.
	The Martyr table shows the maximum level of spell slot you can create.
	The Spell Uses column of the Martyr table shows how many spells you can cast. When you expend hit points to cast a spell, you expend one of these uses. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Hit Points Spellcasting:
Spell Level |  Point Cost
1st | 5
2nd | 10
3rd | 20
4th | 30
5th | 45

Preparing Spells:
You prepare the list of martyr spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the martyr spell list. When you do so, choose a number of martyr spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your martyr level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). Spells you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the Max Spell Level column for your level. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

Healing Magic:
Because your power is derived from mortal suffering, you can't regain hit points from any spell you cast.

Spellcasting Ability:
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your martyr spells, since your power originates in the devotion used to overcome your trials and tribulations. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a martyr spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Spellcasting Focus:
You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your martyr spells.

Martyr Table:
Level | Max Spell Level | Spell uses
2nd | 1st | 2
3rd | 1st | 3
4th | 1st | 3

        <text>At 20th level, you have at last reached your predestination: you will die in eternal glory. You can use your action to become immune to all damage for 10 minutes. For this duration, you can't be blinded, charmed, deafened, exhausted, frightened, incapacitated, poisoned, restrained, or rendered unconscious. You have advantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws.
	Additionally, during this duration, you can cast the wish spell once, without expending a spell slot or hit points. If you use the spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell, the stress of casting it doesn't reduce your Strength or cause you to take necrotic damage.
	At the end of this duration, you die. No force short of divine intervention can prevent your death, and you can't be returned to life by any means.

        <text>Aims to correct all the evils of their life through divine martyrdom.

For all the wrong you have done in your life, the gods have graced you with an undeserved second chance. Your burden is to atone, to undo all the evils you have done in your life, and to seek redemption before the gods. How you accomplish this is your choice, so long as you remove any dark marks you leave behind. Ultimately, your final martyrdom might be a grand act, averting a great disaster or banishing a force of evil, or it might be as humble as redirecting the life of an evil person and causing them to seek redemption, passing the torch to a new martyr of atonement.

To this end, the gods imbue their martyr with ancient and powerful spells, tools once gifted only to prophets.
	When the coming cataclysm threatens the world, a martyr would be ill-served to ignore their call, for the cataclysm imperils them directly-as well as the lives of their family and companions. The life of a martyr is always forfeit, but the rest of the world can yet be saved.

        <name>Mortal Burden: Burden of Truth</name>
        <text>A prophet tasked with bringing a revolutionary truth to the world.

Tasked with unveiling the world's deceptions and delivering to the people a profound truth, martyrs tasked with the Burden of Truth face an endless battle with disillusionment and lies. Such a martyr must earn the people's hearts and minds, turning their favors away from evil influences and toward divine ones. It is an uphill battle, but one that rarely requires grievous violence except in the most dire of circumstances.
	Martyrs of Truth are often deemed prophets, for their gods entrust them with knowledge of the future, insights into the past, and sagacious perspective on the present. Such information is proof of their messages divine origin and is a necessary balm, for the truths such martyrs are called to preach are often a bitter pill for listeners to swallow.

Martyr Level | Spells
3rd | charm person, identify
5th | augury, detect thoughts

        <name>Mortal Burden: Burden of Tyranny</name>
        <text>Fated to become a king and rule with an iron fist.

When malevolent gods find the world pacified and defenseless, they send a martyr of tyranny to conquer its kingdoms, subjugate the weak, and spread misery with their blade. Once unleashed, this martyr stops at nothing to establish an empire to rule over with an iron fist. They demand bloodshed from their foes and pledges of absolute fealty from their allies, taking gleeful satisfaction with every power grab and malicious turn. It is not enough to rule: they must be feared, and any resistance must cower in their shadows. Only then will the gods let them die, likely stabbed in the back by someone crueler or more pitiless.
