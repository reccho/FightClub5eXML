        <name>Arcane Tradition: Familiar Master (HB)</name>
        <text>A master of the find familiar spell who can evolve their magical servant.

Learning the find familiar spell is seen as a rite of passage among fledgling wizards, as the spell offers a useful, if limited, magical servant. However, a small subschool of wizards known as the "familiar masters" or "evolutionists" believe that within the humble spell lies manifold hidden powers. Indeed, their studies have unlocked the spell's hidden potential: the ability to evolve a familiar and fluidly shift its form.

        <text>Beginning when you choose this arcane tradition at 2nd level, you always have the find familiar spell prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you prepare. Additionally, you can cast the spell as an action, without expending material components. When you choose your familiar's creature type, you can choose Aberration, Construct, Elemental, or Undead, in addition to the normal options for the spell.

        <text>Also at 2nd level, you can use an action and expend a spell slot to transform your familiar. When you do, choose a Beast with a challenge rating equal to or lower than half the level of the spell slot expended, and your familiar takes on that Beast's appearance and statistics (except that it keeps its creature type). During this time, your familiar can attack on its turn. This transformation lasts for 10 minutes, after which time you can choose which animal form it takes from those made available by the spell.

        <text>Masters of arcane stratagems who have an innate pool of battle dice.

Unlike most other arcane traditions, mystic savants do not belong to a formalized institution, instead sharing a philosophy that, to master arcana, one must master every individual aspect of it. Their contemporaries call them "universalists" or "holistics," but they are savants by any definition. The skill of spellcasting comes naturally to them, so while other wizards refine a specific school of magic, mystic savants master an array of cross-school stratagems to help them snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.

Battle Dice. You have two battle dice, which are dos. A battle die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended battle dice when you finish a short or long rest, or when you roll initiative.

13th | 3d10
19th | 4d10

Using Battle Dice. Once per turn, you can expend a battle die to use a stratagem of your choice. Your stratagem options are detailed at the end of this subclass description.

Stratagems. You learn three stratagems of your choice, which are detailed under the "Wizard (Mystic Savant (HB)): Stratagems" spell list. Many stratagems enhance a spell in some way. You can use only one stratagem per spell.
	You learn two additional stratagems of your choice at 6th level and one additional stratagem of your choice at 10th and 14th level. Each time you learn new stratagems, you can also replace one stratagem you know with a different one.

        <name>Ravenous Magic Mouth (School of Gastronomy (HB))</name>
        <text>Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to summon a Large-sized disembodied mouth of magical force filled with sharp teeth in an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet. On each of your turns, you can command the mouth to float up to 30 feet (no action required), and you can use your bonus action to command it to bite a creature within 5 feet of it. The mouth uses your spell attack modifier for its melee attack roll, and on a hit, deals 4d10 force damage and grapples its target (escape DC equals your spell save DC) on a hit. The mouth can grapple only one target at a time, and can only attack the creature it is grappling.
	If the mouth is grappling a target of Medium size or smaller at the start of your turn, you can use your bonus action to command it to swallow its target, depositing the creature in an extradimensional space filled with acid. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, taking 4d6 acid damage at the beginning of each of its turns. The creature can use its action to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC to escape. On a success, it magically reappears and falls prone in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the mouth. The creature automatically escapes when the mouth vanishes.
	The mouth disappears after 1 minute, or if you dismiss it early on your turn (no action required). Once you summon the mouth, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

        <name>Arcane Tradition: School of Somnomancy (HB)</name>
        <text>So-called "pajama mages" who master sleep and trance-related magic.

Somnomancers are an idiosyncratic bunch, given to fancies, daydreams, and odd sartorial choices, so it is no surprise that their subschool of magic is rarely accorded any respect by mages of other schools. Although their obsession with sleep is occasionally useful, such as when someone needs to be hypnotized or must have their dreams interpreted, it is more often a source of humor-much to the chagrin of so-called "pajama mages"!

        <text>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, your mastery over sleep magic has rendered you a persistent sleep-walker. While you are asleep, you can move around freely; you don't fully perceive your environment while asleep, so you must navigate from memory. Additionally, you can copy spells to your spellbook while asleep.

	• The total number of hit points that can be affected is equal to double the number rolled on the dice.

	• The radius of the spell is increased to 30 feet.

	• You can freely choose the order in which creatures are affected by a sleep spell you cast.

        <name>Mesmerize (School of Somnomancy (HB))</name>
        <text>Beginning at 6th level, by performing a repetitive action for 1 minute, you can hypnotize a willing or unconscious creature within 60 feet that can see or hear you.
	While hypnotized by you, it is semi-conscious and charmed by you. Other spells and effects that charm the creature or influence its mind have no effect while the creature is hypnotized. If you choose, you can cause a creature to repeat its saving throw against these effects, ending an effect on itself on a success.
	The creature has the ability to perfectly recall its memories while hypnotized, including memories that have been magically altered or suppressed. While hypnotized, the creature will truthfully answer any question you pose to it.
	Lastly, you can specify a single command word to be embedded in the creature's subconscious for up to 24 hours. The first time the creature hears the command word while it isn't hypnotized, it immediately performs the single action or repeats a certain phrase that you specified while the creature was hypnotized. The creature performs this action or speaks this phrase even if the effects of a spell would compel them to act otherwise.
	The creature remains hypnotized by you for up to 1 hour, or until it takes damage or you end it early by snapping your fingers.

They can only appear monstrous to one of the targets, however, and the spell ends immediately after that option is utilized.
