        <name>Divine Domain: Destruction Domain (HB)</name>
        <text>Imbued with power by the ruinous gods of entropy.

Some gods revel only in the crushing of walls and the burning of cities. These gods of destruction, critical counterparts to the gods of creation and mercy, need not be evil, but have a strong tendency toward chaos and enforcing the eternal cycle of death and rebirth. Clerics who follow such deities often have a deep personal connection with their chosen god. In some cases, they were spared from destruction in order to wreak it upon the world; in others, they have pleaded with the god for priesthood to destroy a single foe; others still simply worship their god out of reverent fear.

Destruction Domain Spells:
Cleric Level | Spells
1st | burning hands, thunderwave
3rd | scorching ray, shatter
5th | fireball, protection from energy
7th | blight, wall of fire
9th | cloudkill, cone of cold

For the next minute, whenever you deal damage with a cleric spell, it is empowered with ruinous potential. If you roll the highest number possible on any of the spell's damage dice, you can roll that die again and add its damage to the total, rolling again if this number is also the highest, and so on. You can roll a total number of damage dice for this spell equal to twice the number of damage dice you initially rolled.

The shockwave is a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on the creature that only damages objects that aren't being worn or carried. Each object in the area takes damage equal to twice the damage dealt to the creature, ignoring the object's damage threshold.

        <text>An unhinged devotee of an insane god, spreading madness far and wide.

Your divine powers originate with the Madgod, a being of paranoia, mayhem, and psychosis. Every deranged thought or uncontrolled flight of fancy empowers the Madgod, who cares little for the logic of other godly domains. That is, of course, because the Madgod is a squirrel living outside the kingdom who once told you the secret of divine power is actually to collect enough fresh boysenberries, but never to eat them, and that it helps to have a good horse at your side. And lo, the rules of reality slipped away and you realized the wisdom of the Madgod's words. It all makes sense if you think diagonally and squint your ears the right way!

Madness Domain Spells:
Cleric Level | Spells
1st | hideous laughter, silent image
3rd | blindness/deafness, detect thoughts

Roll on the following table to determine the madness which afflicts the creature. A creature that is frenzied can repeat this saving throw whenever it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Temporary Insanity:
d20 | Effect
1-5 |  Aphasia. The creature can't speak and is incapable of spellcasting or understanding others.
6-10 |  Delusion. The creature experiences vivid hallucinations. Whenever the creature makes an attack or targets a creature with a spell or effect, roll a d20. On an odd roll, the attack misses, or the spell or effect fails.
11-15 |  Frenzy. The creature becomes frenzied. A frenzied creature loses the ability to distinguish between friend and foe, regarding all creatures it can see as enemies. While frenzied, the creature chooses the targets for its attacks, spells, and abilities randomly from among the creatures it can see within range, and it must make an opportunity attack if any creature provokes one.
16-20 | Vertigo. The creature falls prone at the end of each of its turns if it's not leaning against something.

No Up, No Down. Each creature and object within the area is weightless, as per the levitate spell.

Opposite Day. If a creature in the area would have advantage, it instead has disadvantage, and vice versa.

Red Light, Green Light. No creature can move on its turn. At the start of each round of combat, each creature simultaneously chooses where to move and moves to that space. If two or more creatures move into the same space, they collide and are knocked prone.

Through the Looking Glass. At the beginning of each creature's turn, roll any die. On an even roll, the creature doubles in size, as per the Enlarge effect of the enlarge/reduce spell; on an odd roll, the creature halves in size, as per the Reduce effect of the enlarge/reduce spell.

Bloodmore. Whenever the creature takes bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, it loses an additional 1d6 hit points.

Joint Lock. The creature's legs stiffen and its movement slows. The creature can move a maximum of 15 feet or half its speed, whichever is lower, on its turn.

        <name>Divine Domain: Wealth Domain (HB)</name>
        <text>Is capitalism a god? Yes, yes it is.

Being one of the most popular pursuits of humanoids the world over, it should not come as a surprise that the accumulation of material wealth is governed by its own deities. Sitting at the confluence of industry and fertility, gods of wealth are assiduous in demanding tribute, but pay back their most loyal followers generously, showering them with gold.

Wealth Domain Spells:
Cleric Level | Spells
1st | identity, unseen servant
3rd | arcane lock, locate object
5th | glyph of warding, tongues
7th | fabricate, Leomund's secret chest
9th | creation, geas

        <name>Appraisal (Wealth Domain (HB))</name>
        <text>When you choose this domain at 1st level, you are blessed with insights into the price of everything. As an action, you can accurately determine the market price of any object, as well as what it would be worth second-hand.
	Additionally, you can use your Wisdom instead of Charisma for any Charisma check you make to buy, sell, or haggle.

        <name>Channel Divinity: Riches (Wealth Domain (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you can use your Channel Divinity to conjure an explosion of coins around the creature. The total number of gold pieces created is equal to the monster's XP value divided by 10, rounded down.
	You can use this Channel Divinity option once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.

        <name>Bribe (Wealth Domain (HB))</name>
        <text>When you reach 6th level, you can use your divine understanding to determine how to bribe almost any creature. As an action, you can choose a hostile creature you can see to make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. If the creature fails its save, you can bribe it with rare or luxurious goods, or simply a bag of gold, which teleports into the creature's possession. The bribe costs an amount in gp equal to half the creature's XP value and, once completed, that creature can't be hostile toward you or your allies for 24 hours. The effect ends early if the creature takes damage from you or your allies. You can't bribe any creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower, or any creature the GM deems inappropriate.

        <name>Tycoon (Wealth Domain (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 17th level, your deity grants you a holy subsidy on your spellcasting. You don't need to provide material components for any cleric spell, even if it requires costly material components that are used or consumed by the spell.
	Additionally, you can grant the benefit of your Leverage feature to friendly creatures within 60 feet of you.
