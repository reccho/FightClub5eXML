        <text>Raises great stone henges, magical structures of foreboding power.

Age-old monuments crafted in forgotten times attest to a simple truth: there is power in stones. Druids who join the ancient Circle of Stones carry on the tradition of raising stone henges in places of great power, where leylines intersect and magic strengthens. Such locations are marked as nexuses of power, where the Forgotten Laws of the Old Gods are still heeded-but such things are known only to a few druids today. Others merely see the looming stone monuments as enigmatic circles, grim reminders of the enormity of time.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Raise Henge (Circle of Stones (HB))</name>
        <text>When you select this circle at 2nd level, you learn to create patterns of stones which strengthen magic. You can expend a use of your Wild Shape as an action to magically create a henge, a set of standing stones, around a point you can see within 60 feet. A henge is composed of six stones, each 5 feet high, 3 feet wide, and 1 foot thick, arranged evenly in a 10-foot-radius circle. Such a stone can generally grant three-quarters cover from ranged attacks for a Medium creature. You can only create a henge in a location which can support the stones' weight.
	When you begin your turn in your henge, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your druid level (rounded down). Additionally, you can choose any number of allies to also be affected by the henge. A creature you choose gains temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier when it begins its turn within the henge. Temporary hit points granted by the henge last only while the creature is within the henge.
	Your henge maintains its magical properties for 8 hours. After this duration, you can expend another use of your Wild Shape ability to render the stones permanent, though they no longer grant temporary hit points; otherwise, they vanish.
	As you gain higher levels in this class, you can raise larger henges. At 10th-level, you can create a 15-foot-radius henge consisting of 10 stones, and at 14th-level, you can create a 20-foot-radius henge consisting of 20 stones. You choose the henge's radius when you create it.

        <text>At 6th level, your henges can hold great threats at bay. While within a henge, you can cast the magic circle spell as an action, without expending a spell slot or material components. The spell is centered on the henge and its radius and height matches that of the henge. Once you cast this spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

        <text>By 10th level, you can use your henges to travel through the leylines that connect the world. By spending 1 minute concentrating as if on a spell while within a henge, you can create a magical link between that henge and another henge on the same plane of existence, as per the spell teleportation circle. You must have seen or touched the destination henge at least once before. For the next minute, any creature can use an action to step into the target henge and exit from the destination henge.

        <text>Beginning at 14th level, when you cast a druid spell that requires concentration while you are within a henge, you can transfer the spell to the henge, which manifests as a series of burning runes on the stones. You can only use this ability on a spell of 5th level or lower whose effect is entirely contained within the henge. If the spell's area of effect would be larger than the area of the henge, you can limit the spell's area to the henge's boundary. The henge maintains concentration on the spell instead of you for the spell's duration, allowing you to maintain two spells which require concentration at once. The spell ends early if any part of its effect leaves the area of the henge or if you use this feature to transfer another spell to a henge.

        <name>Druid Circle: Circle of the City (HB)</name>
        <text>Manipulates the brickwork and cobblestones of cities instead of beasts and trees.

The city lives; it has a pulse. Its skin is of walls and towering stone structures, its breath of chimneys and rivers. While the city exists, it lives in harmony with its people, a delicate balance mediated by the urban druids. These urban druids belong to the Circle of the City and are a direct antithesis to the conventional idea of a druid; whereas a normal druid lives among majestic forests or breathtaking mountains and dresses in the greenery of the forest, an urban druid wears unassuming clothes and wanders the back alleys of a well-trodden city. But their powers are not to be underestimated. Druids of this circle can channel their natural powers to twist the streets into knots, uproot towers, and animate the cobblestones. Their charge might be unorthodox, but their authority over the cityscape matches any other druid's power over the forest.

For example, entangle and spike growth might cause growths of metal wires and twisting pipes.

        <name>City Shape (Circle of the City (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level, as an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to warp the city around you. Choose one of the following effects:

Cobbleshift. You magically manipulate the components of a constructed floor-bricks, cobblestones, planks, and similar objects-within 60 feet. Each component can move up to 1 foot and doesn't cause instabilities in their structures. When you use this effect, you can cause any sections of floor that you choose within the area to become difficult terrain, and can cause any creature standing in one of those sections to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or fall prone. You are unaffected by this difficult terrain.
	Additionally, you can use your action on each of your turns to raise up to three low walls from the floor, each 2 and 1/2 feet high, 5 feet wide, and 1 foot thick. Such a wall can generally provide half cover for a Medium creature. These walls provide no instability in surrounding structures. This ability lasts for 1 minute. After this time, all components and walls magically revert to their original positions.

Passwall. You cast the spell passwall without expending a spell slot or material components.

Wall Warp. A wall that you can see within 30 feet magically shifts, grows, shrinks, or rotates. This wall must be a contiguous surface without corners, at most 1 foot thick, and must be either made out of wood, plaster, or stone, or not be naturally occurring. The wall must remain vertical, but you can move it into any position you choose within a 60-foot radius of its previous position. Its new position can't include spaces occupied by creatures or objects. If you cause the wall to grow or shrink, you can only change its dimensions vertically. These changes to the wall create no instability in their structures. After 1 minute, the wall reverts to its original size and position.

If a creature other than you is completely within the smog at the start of its turn, it must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be poisoned until the start of its next turn, as it coughs uncontrollably.
	This smog dissipates after 1 minute. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.

	Additionally, when you use your City Shape feature, you can warp the gravity along any surfaces you choose within a 60-foot radius. For the next minute, creatures and objects within 15 feet of one of these surfaces fall toward it as if it were the ground. A creature can walk on this surface as if it were level ground, even if the surface is perpendicular to the ground or upside down. At the end of this duration, all creatures and objects fall from the affected surfaces.

The druids that maintain and protect the land are deluded to think that they keep dominion over the natural world, for they stand guard over only a small fraction of it; far greater, and far wilder, is the deep. Druids of the Deep are fewer in number, but greater in task, vowing to stand guard over the world's oceans, seas, lakes, and rivers, and to safeguard their inhabitants from the fools that walk the surface.
	The crushing depths have hardened these druids, and taught them to battle with every weapon underneath the waves. After all, the ocean is an unforgiving place; you can't survive by just talking to fish.

The defenders of the forests and champions of the trees, druids who join the Circle of the Fist take their charge as natural protectors seriously. Traditionally, all druid circles strive to protect the natural realm and maintain the world's balance, but only druids of this circle guard the woodlands with the vigilance and fervor of a territorial beast. Fists of the Forest, as they are called, stave off intruders to their realms with flurries of bare-fisted strikes, empowered by the natural world, before disappearing into the treetops. At the height of their expertise, these druids fight more like beasts of the forests than men, and are twice as deadly.
	Often, this druidic order safeguards sacred groves and permanent fey bridges, but sometimes its members adopt quests of vengeance for misdeeds done to the forest, or quests of intervention to ensure that a prophesied disaster doesn't come to pass.

If you also expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher, you can make 2 unarmed strikes as a bonus action. If you expend a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you make 3 unarmed strikes.

        <text>Starting when you choose this circle at 2nd level, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature as an action to magically summon a swarm of rats in your space. The swarm vanishes after a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down),
if it drops to 0 hit points, or if you use this ability to summon a new swarm.
	The summoned swarm is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned swarm, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to it, it defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions.
	While the swarm is in your space, you have a +2 bonus to AC and, when you take damage, you can choose for the swarm to take damage instead of you.
	Starting at 6th level, you can summon a swarm of bats, swarm of insects, or swarm of ravens, and starting at 14th level, you can summon a swarm of poisonous snakes.

        <name>Infested (Circle of Vermin (HB))</name>
        <text>At 2nd level, insects and rodents inhabit every nook and cranny of your clothes and gear. Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with an attack, these vermin retaliate, dealing 1d4 piercing damage to the attacker. Additionally, the creature subtracts the piercing damage dealt from the next attack roll it makes before the end of its turn.

        <name>Tremorsense (Circle of Vermin (HB))</name>
        <text>By 6th level, vibrations in the ground echo through its ants and earthworms, and by extension, you can sense them. You gain tremorsense, the ability to detect and pinpoint vibrations, with a range of 10 feet. To use this sense, you and the source of the vibrations must be in contact with the same ground or substance. This sense can't be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures.

        <name>Plague Carrier (Circle of Vermin (HB))</name>
        <text>Beginning at 10th level, your constant close proximity to disease-carrying creatures has not only inoculated you to their diseases, but also allowed you to act as a vector of plague. You are immune to diseases and the poisoned condition. Whenever you would normally make a Constitution saving throw to avoid contracting a disease or the poisoned condition, you can instead become a carrier of that disease or poison. You can only be a carrier of one disease or poison at a time, and you can only carry it for up to seven days.
	As a reaction when you take damage from a creature you can see within 5 feet of you, you can transfer a disease or poison you are carrying to that creature, which must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the creature contracts the disease or poison, and you are no longer a carrier of it.
