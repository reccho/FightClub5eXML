    <text>This abrasive paste can be applied as an action to the claws, fangs, tusks, or spines of a creature to make them sharper, harder, or cleaner. For 8 hours after application, that creature gains a +1 to attack and damage rolls with its natural weapons, which count as being made of adamantine for the purposes of overcoming damage resistance and immunity.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This clear, odorless potion is housed in a wickedlooking syringe that contains 4 doses. You can administer the anesthetic to a willing creature as an action, dulling its nerves and making it impossible for it to feel pain for one hour. An anesthetized creature has advantage on Constitution checks and saving throws and can't be incapacitated or have disadvantage on rolls due to being in pain. However, the creature is unaware of how much pain it is in or how many levels of exhaustion it has. If a player character is anesthetized, the GM tracks the character's hit points and levels of exhaustion instead of the player for the duration.
	If you administer a dose over the course of a minute to a willing or unconscious creature, you can render the creature unconscious for one hour. If you continue to slowly administer anesthetic (one dose every eight hours), you can keep a creature unconscious for up to 24 hours; keeping a creature unconscious longer than this results in death.

    <text>This stupendously complex vessel the size of a cask is festooned with valves and dials. While attuned to the reactor, you can use an action to adjust its settings and begin producing any of the following potions: potion of flying, potion of hill giant strength, potion of invisibility, potion of superior healing, sovereign glue (1 ounce), or universal solvent.
	The reactor rumbles and whirs for the next 12 hours as it produces the specified potion. Once it is finished, you can use your action to pour the potion from the top of the reactor. This potion loses its potency and becomes nonmagical if it is not consumed within 24 hours.
	Additionally, while attuned to the reactor, you can regain 2 expended reagent dice whenever you finish a short rest.

	If the target is an object that isn't being worn or carried, the acid dissolves a 1-foot cube of the object. If splashed on a suit of armor or a shield, the object takes a permanent and cumulative - 1 penalty to the AC it offers. A suit of armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield that drops to a +0 bonus is destroyed. If splashed on a weapon, it takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. A weapon reduced to a -5 penalty is destroyed. It has no effect on magic items and objects made of gold, glass, stone, or adamantine.
	If the target is a creature, it takes 3d6 acid damage, followed by an extra 2d6 acid damage at the end of its next turn and another 1d6 acid damage at the end of the turn after that. The acid can be washed off with one gallon of water, ending the effect early.

    <text>This masterful painting, at least a 5-foot square in area, was crafted by a master painter using at least ten pots of marvelous pigments. It depicts a serene painted world. The painting itself acts as a portal to a demiplane in which the painted world exists, and is large enough to allow Medium creatures to pass through unhindered. Inside the painted world, a misty archway is a portal to the real world. If the painting is rolled up or faced toward a solid surface, the portal disappears inside the painted world.
	The location, objects, and creatures depicted within the painted world are determined by the painting's creator, but such objects and creatures can't leave the painted world, as they can't pass through the portal, and disappear into smoke if removed from the demiplane by other means. Time passes at half speed within the painted world, and you don't need to eat or drink while within it.

It never specifies an exact time. Once a creature has read the letter, it has advantage on death saving throws, and dies only after gaining five death saving throw failures, instead of three. However, when the creature arrives at the moment of its death described in the letter, it dies without making death saving throws if it is reduced to 0 hit points.
	Once a memento mori is opened and read, it becomes an ordinary letter. Its effects end only if the creature that read it dies and is later restored to life.

If the weapon can't be dropped, such as a dragon's bite or claws, the attacker instead has disadvantage on all weapon attacks until the end of its turn.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>As a bonus action, or a reaction to being hit by an attacker you can see, you can spin the ring's jewel, causing it to expand into a hollow block of clear ice that completely surrounds you. This iceberg occupies your space and pushes creatures within your space to the nearest unoccupied area, ending any grapple in which you are involved. There is enough room within the iceberg to move around, but you can't move more than 6 inches in any direction. Spells and other magical effects can't extend through the iceberg or be cast through it.
	The iceberg is an object with AC 10 and 100 HP. If it was activated as a reaction, it takes as much of the triggering damage as possible. The iceberg has immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage, and vulnerability to fire damage. The iceberg lasts for up to 1 minute, until it is destroyed, or until you use a bonus action to cease the jewel's spinning.
	Once you spin the ring to create an iceberg, you can't do so again until the following dawn.

    <text>You can pour this substance on the ground as an action. If poured onto stone, a 10-foot deep, 10-foot radius portion of the stone becomes mud for 1 hour.
	When poured into mud, sand, or quicksand, a 10-foot deep, 10-foot radius region of the material becomes solid stone for 1 hour. The stone has AC 17, 75 HP, and immunity to psychic and poison damage. Any creature inside it when it becomes stone must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained. The restrained creature can break free by succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check or by dealing 25 damage to the stone. This sandlike substance flows about its container like a fluid.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This blank scroll is imbued with enchantments that enable it to copy text from another source. As an action, you can touch the scroll of duplication to an object that contains writing. The scroll instantaneously copies up to 500 consecutive words from the source material (you can choose which section if the source material is longer than this), creating a perfect duplicate of the original text. The scroll only copies nonmagical text, not illustrations or magical writings (such as the contents of a spellbook or a glyph of warding). If the source contains a mixture of magical writing, illustrations, and nonmagical text, only the nonmagical text is copied, leaving blank space where illustrations and magical writing would be expected. Using the scroll doesn't activate magical traps that trigger upon reading the source material.

    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>Worn like a backpack, these brass and mithral legs deploy when you're knocked out or paralyzed. A series of switches allows you to program the legs with either the "Defend" or "Eliminate" setting, as well as a list of friendly creatures in order of priority.
	Whenever you are paralyzed or knocked unconscious (except when unconscious due to nonmagical sleep), the skitterlegs deploy, lifting your body from the ground. While the legs are deployed, you don't count as being prone. Attacks made against you while the legs are deployed aren't critical hits, even though you are paralyzed or unconscious. The legs make Strength and Dexterity checks and saving throws with a +5 modifier.
	The legs have a walking speed of 30 feet. On each of your turns while you are paralyzed or unconscious, the legs behave according to their settings:

Defend: The legs take the Dodge or Disengage action (your choice when you program the legs) and move toward the highest-priority friendly creature that is still conscious.

Eliminate: The legs move toward the nearest hostile creature and make two melee attacks with an attack bonus of +7. On a hit, the legs deal 1d8 + 2 piercing damage.
	If you regain consciousness or recover from paralysis, the legs set you back on your feet before retracting. The legs can function for one cumulative hour each day. If this duration is exceeded, the legs collapse and drop you prone.

If the pipe is full of one ounce of smoking herb, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to inhale deeply from it and exhale dragon's flame. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius cone must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 8d6 fire damage, or half as much on a successful one.

    <text>The sorting beast is a six-legged machine with eyes, legs, and antennae at both ends, as well as an array of measuring devices near its center. It can manipulate and hold objects up to 30 pounds in weight.
	When activated as an action, the sorting beast sets about collecting and sorting all loose valuable items within 100 feet. It sorts all gold pieces, silver pieces, and copper pieces into neat stacks of 10. For material goods, such as precious stones, the sorting beast can appraise value by weight and quality, before sorting the goods appropriately and printing the results on a fine paper strip. The sorting beast continues sorting until finished or deactivated as an action.
	Additionally, the sorting beast can cast the spell identify, without using material components, on one object you designate each day.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This mixture of mithral, quicksilver, and platinum molds easily and adheres to steel, allowing a trained craftsman to make unique compound weapons. While attuned to the amalgam, you can spend a minute heating the amalgam and carefully attaching it to a weapon or removing it from one. The amalgam can be attached to two weapons at a time. Once attached to two weapons, the weapons become magical, and each gains a +1 bonus to its attack and damage rolls, unless it is a magic weapon that already has a bonus to those rolls.
	Additionally, each weapon gains the Switch property. A switch weapon has two forms; you can swap between which weapon is being used at any time, even between attacks. Unlike other switch weapons, weapons unified with the amalgam do not become exotic weapons.

    <name>Weapon Charms</name>
    <detail>varies</detail>
    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>A weapon charm is a small ornament fixed on a loop of string or chain. You can use your action to attach the charm on a weapon, usually on the weapon's pommel, causing the weapon to become a magic weapon that requires attunement. Even if the weapon was already magical, you must attune to it again to gain the charm's magical benefits, which are listed in the charm's description. A weapon can only have one charm attached at a time.

Bat (Uncommon): This obsidian charm appears like a shrieking bat. While attached, when you deal damage to a creature with this weapon, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. The creature dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

Blade (Uncommon): This adamantine charm is shaped like a miniature longsword. While attached, you have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This bonus doesn't apply to magic weapons that already have a bonus to attack and damage rolls.

Die (Uncommon): This silver charm depicts a six-sided die. While attached, the weapon deals more potent critical hits. When you score a critical hit, if you roll the maximum number on any damage die, you can roll an extra damage die and add its damage to the total, rolling again if this die is also the maximum number, and so on. You can roll a total number of damage dice for this critical hit equal to twice the number of damage dice you initially rolled.

Feather (Common): This gold charm of a feather feels unusually light. While attached, this weapon weighs half as much as usual. Small creatures can effectively use the weapon, even if it has the Heavy property.

Ghost (Common): This crystal charm is carved into the shape of a wispy spirit. While attached, the weapon can affect creatures on the Ethereal Plane as if they were on the Material Plane, and vice versa.

Hook (Common): This bronze charm is shaped like a fishing hook. When attached, if the weapon is on the same plane of existence, you can use your bonus action to teleport it to your hand.

Lance (Uncommon): This copper charm depicts a short lance. While attached, once on each of your turns when you make a melee attack with this weapon against a creature you can see, you can lunge up to 15 feet toward your target before making the attack. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. You can perform this movement even if it causes you to travel through the air, though you fall after making the attack if you have nothing holding you aloft.

Lightning Bolt (Uncommon): This mithral charm depicts a wild lightning bolt. While attached, this weapon deals an extra 1d6 lightning damage to any target it hits.

Mirror (Rare): This shiny platinum charm depicts an elegant hand mirror. This charm can only be attached to a weapon with the Light property. When attached, when you draw the weapon with one hand, a spectral duplicate of the weapon appears in your other hand. This spectral duplicate has identical statistics to the original weapon, including its magical effects, but doesn't include ammunition. When the attached weapon or its spectral duplicate leaves your hand, the duplicate vanishes.

    <text>While attuned to this coin, you are constantly under the effect of the glibness spell.

Curse: This coin is cursed; attuning to it extends its curse to you. You can only break attunement to the coin with the remove curse spell or similar magic. While attuned to the coin, you can't deliberately speak the truth. You can be evasive in your wording, lie by omission, or speak half-truths, as long as your words remain within the boundaries of deception.
