        <text>A divine lyricist who heals with their voice.

The cantors are a group of bards who lead the faithful through the praise and worship of the gods. Their music is directed toward the heavens, with their instruments usually relating in some way to the god that they worship. Cantors are well loved within their respective communities, and it is hard to find a talented cantor who will stay in one place for long, as the demand for their soothing hymns is widespread.

	• As part of the action used to cast this spell, you can use the Help action to aid two allies. If you use the Help action to aid an ally in attacking a creature, the target of that attack can be within 30 feet of you, rather than within 5 feet of you, if the target can see or hear you.

	• You ward a willing creature you can see within 30 feet with a shimmering golden radiance for up to 1 minute. Only one creature can be warded using this ability at a time. When an attacker within 5 feet of the warded creature hits it with an attack, the creature can use its reaction to deal radiant damage equal to half your bard level to the attacker.

To many, the College of Grafhiti is a nuisance, a band of hooligans that vandalize the city with no regard for the law. But bards who learn to tag know that graffiti is the single greatest art form. Graffiti artists use the entire city as their canvas, placing murals of inspiration where everyone can see them and personal tags where few will notice. Theirs is a bold, creative endeavor that, while illegal, breathes vibrancy into the city and emboldens those within it.

These bards specialize in truth through biting humor, rather than stories or sonnets, and compliment their razor wits with acrobatic stunts and other feats of showmanship. When among nobility, jesters offer off-kilter wisdom and fierce satire in equal measures. Among their peers, jesters make fine companions, as long as you can take a joke.

Bards who join in this college come to believe that all life is performed, rather than lived, and that to become an actor in this Great Play requires that one merely put on the metaphorical mask of another. To engage in this great stage drama, a master of masks carries with them a number of masks, each a potent magical artifact of a specific archetypal character or creature to allow them to better enter those roles.

Love is a powerful thing, and none know this better than the bards of the College of Romance. Paramours, seductors, and silver-tongued devils, these bards have turned the art of wooing someone into a science, which they ply to their advantage with mechanical efficiency. Given the option, these bards would rather make love than war, knowing full well that an enemy turned ally is twice as effective as an enemy slain.

Enchantment Isn't Love:
Spellcasters of all stripes possess magic which can influence the heart, inspiring emotions which simply aren't genuine. When this magic fades, so too do the emotions they inspired. Even spellcasters which derive their powers from emotionality should be mindful of this: magically inspired emotions are manipulative, not romantic.

    <text>This gleaming silver mask bears a golden, jeweled diadem instead of eyes. When a creature rolls one of your Bardic Inspiration dice and rolls a 1 while you wear this mask, it can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

Improvement: Starting at 6th level, the creature can reroll the Bardic Inspiration die when it rolls a 1 or 2, and must use the new roll.

    <text>This white fabric mask conceals the face as a funeral shroud, with two gold coins sewn over the eyes. You become invisible if you do not speak, move, or take any actions for 1 minute. You remain invisible for up to 10 minutes or until you remove this mask, take damage, make an attack, or cast a spell. While invisible, you can become half visible as a ghostly image or return to invisibility as a bonus action.

Improvement: Starting at 6th level, while invisible, you levitate an inch above the ground, allowing you to ignore difficult terrain and make no noise while moving.
