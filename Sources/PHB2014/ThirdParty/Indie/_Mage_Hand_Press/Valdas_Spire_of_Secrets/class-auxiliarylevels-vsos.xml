        <text>Prerequisite: 3rd Level

With patience or a bit of magic, you have trained an animal companion to accompany you on your adventures. Few people can become fast friends with a wolf, but it's hard to undervalue their teeth in a brawl.

        <name>Beast Companion</name>
        <text>Choose a Beast that is no larger than Medium and has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower. Add your proficiency bonus to the Beast's AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its hit point maximum equals the hit point number in its stat block or four times your level, whichever is higher. Like any creature, it can spend Hit Dice during a short rest to regain hit points.
	The Beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative. On your turn, you can verbally command the Beast where to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, or Help action. If you don't issue a command, the Beast takes the Dodge action. If you gain the Extra Attack feature or another feature that allows you to attack twice when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your attacks to command the Beast to take the Attack action.
	If you are incapacitated or absent, the Beast acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself. The Beast never requires your command to use its reaction, such as when making an opportunity attack.
	If the Beast dies, you can obtain a new companion by spending 8 hours training and bonding with a Beast that isn't hostile to you and that meets the requirements.

        <text>When you take bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage while you have half your hit points or fewer, you can use your reaction to roll a d6 and reduce the damage taken by the number rolled. The damage reduction increases to 1d8 when you reach 5th level, 1d10 when you reach 11th level, and 1d12 when you reach 17th level.

        <text>Be it a family heirloom or a recovered artifact, you have come into possession of a mysterious weapon. Though its iron is rusted and its wood is stained with blood, an unseen power weights its swing, and you can feel an intelligence echoing within it. Once you bind with it, the weapon is linked with your soul, and it grows in power as you do.

        <name>Sentient Weapon</name>
        <text>When you gain this level, you acquire a sentient magic weapon that bonds to your very soul and grows in might as you do. Your weapon is your choice of any martial weapon that lacks the Two Handed property. Once made, this decision can't be changed.
	You can use your action to summon your sentient weapon to your open hand. You are proficient with it while you wield it.

Magic Weapon. The weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. When you reach 5th level, your bond with the weapon strengthens, and you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. At 11th level, your bond strengthens further, and you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the weapon.

Relic Magic. Your relic weapon has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you use the Attack action to make an attack with your relic weapon, you can spend 1 of its charges to make an attack using it as a bonus action.
	Additionally, whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can siphon some of the energy into the weapon. The next time you hit a creature with the weapon during the next minute, you deal extra force damage equal to twice the spell's level.

Sentience. The weapon is a sentient magic item with an alignment and personality determined by the GM. It has an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 14. The weapon has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet, and it can speak, read, and understand Common, as well as communicate with you telepathically.

Blades-for-hire, mercenaries, sellswords; they go by many names. As a somewhat veteran sellsword, you've learned that mercenary work is a volatile business from which only the cautious and cunning can hope to profit. You might have established a set of personal rules or superstitions, or simply gathered a raft of tricks to give you the edge when life and death (and profit) are on the line.

        <text>You learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called battle dice.

Battle Dice. You have two battle dice, which are d6s. A battle die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended battle dice when you finish a short or long rest, or when you roll initiative. Once per turn, you can expend a battle die to perform a maneuver of your choice.

Maneuvers. You learn two maneuvers of your choice from among those available to the Captain class or those available to the Grey Watchman subclass of the warden class.

Saving Throws. Some maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated a s follows:

	Maneuver Save Dc = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)

Whether you made some dastardly friends, discovered a love for illicit substances, or merely decided that the law shouldn't stand in the way of making some coin, you're in deep with the criminal underworld. You can probably keep your criminal ties under wraps, but you can't stop looking over your shoulder for fear that the authorities, or worse, your friends might come calling.

        <text>During your training you learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.
	In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.
