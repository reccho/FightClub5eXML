      <name>Investigator</name>
      <text>Utility, the class

Supernatural researchers and monster hunters, investigators use a few silver-tipped crossbow bolts and a tome brimming with rituals to banish monsters that stalk the night. Play an investigator if you want access to boundless utility options and the ability to go toe-to-toe with a vampire or werewolf.

A collage of diagrams, maps, and small items litters the wall, pinned with nails and connected by a spiderweb of colorful strings. An elf stands nearby, contemplating the mystery splayed out in front of her and readying her crossbow for work.
	A half-orc wearing a wide-brimmed hat leafs through a thick tome, double-checking the supplies: a sturdy net trap, holy symbols on the doors, cloves of garlic, and several dozen wooden stakes. The preparations made, the half-orc slinks into the shadows and readies himself for the bloodshed.
	Blood dripping from its fangs and claws, a monstrously fat demon bears down on a human, who busies herself marking a tavern's door frame with a few chalkmark runes. She takes a long step back and waits. As the demon lunges for its next meal, an invisible force lashes forth from the doorway, lopping off its hand and raking its stomach. The fiend howls with rage, and the inquisitor breathes a sigh of relief.
	Supernatural detectives and monster slayers, investigators are always on the hunt for malevolent outsiders. Whenever evil seeps into the world-be it fiends, undead, or strange abominations from beyond the stars—investigators will be the first to locate them and banish their foul corruption from the mortal plane.

    <trait>
      <name>Paranormal Investigators</name>
      <text>There are forces more ancient than time, foes more sinister than the foulest men, and beings more titanic than gods. The world stands on a precipice of woe and terror, being threatened nightly by dark agents and hordes of monsters. At risk to their own lives and sanities, investigators penetrate the evil that creeps in the shadows and banish it from the world. Their battles are never-ending, for victory only delays doomsday another night.
	Investigators track supernatural threats ranging from incorporeal spirits, to nefarious vampires and lycanthropes, to incursions of demons and devils. Often in their investigations, they uncover secret cults and maligned individuals who bring these supernatural threats to bear. It is always their goal to impede these evildoers by any means necessary, resorting to trickery, guile, magic, and bloodshed when necessary. To an investigator, no tactic is unthinkable when the world is at stake.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Exorcists and Occultists</name>
      <text>Even as they strive to contain its influence from the world at large, investigators dabble in forbidden magic to give themselves an edge against supernatural threats. Prepared investigators keep a well-stocked grimoire of magical secrets, containing rituals, incantations, notes on monsters' powers and weaknesses, recipes for poisons, and arcane diagrams-everything needed to confront their foes on an even footing. Even so, an investigator's occupation is perilous. A grimoire might spell out a vampires fear of sunlight and aversion to silver, but it does little to hinder their fangs.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Creating an Investigator</name>
      <text>As you build your investigator, consider what sort of supernatural threat first drove you to investigating and combating the occult. Did one of your family members strike a bargain with a fiend? Were you kidnapped by a cabal of vampires or a pack of lycanthropes? Did you stumble across evidence of an eldritch abomination, such as a Great Old One? The type of creature you first did battle with likely shaped your tools and methods later on.
	Did you apprentice under a seasoned monster hunter, learning the ropes of tracking a threat, uncovering its weaknesses, and setting a trap for it? Or did you strike out on your own, compiling your own grimoire from hard-earned research? Perhaps you learned everything about monster hunting from someone else's grimoire, a masterwork containing an abridged library of occult knowledge and a lifetime of experience. It's even possible that you signed a contract with a minor fiend and turned to supernatural investigation in a last-ditch effort to save your soul.

Quick Build:
Follow these suggestions to build an investigator quickly: Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity or Strength. Then, select the rituals clue, comprehend languages, detect magic, and transient bulwark to add to your grimoire. Finally, pick any background, preferably one that relates to your experience with supernatural monsters and the occult.</text>

Ability Score Minimum:
As a multiclass character, you must have at least the following ability score(s) to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already an investigator.

	• Intelligence 13

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Multiclass Features</name>
        <text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does).
	Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared:
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.
	Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
	If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots:
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
	If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.
	For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic:
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

        <text>At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies; your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. At 6th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.

      <feature>
        <name>Ritualist</name>
        <text>You maintain a grimoire brimming with magical rituals: your most potent tools to defeat supernatural threats.

Grimoire:
At 1st level, you have a grimoire containing four 1st-level spells of your choice that have the ritual tag from any class's spell list (the spells needn't be from the same list). You can't cast spells that are in your grimoire except as rituals, unless you've learned them by some other means.
	Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can add an additional ritual spell from the Investigator Spells list to your grimoire at no cost. The Ritual Level column on the Investigator table shows the maximum spell level you can add to your grimoire.
	Additionally, whenever you find a ritual spell on your adventures, you can add it to your grimoire if it is on the investigator spell list and is of a level you can add to your grimoire. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.

Bonus Rituals:
As an investigator, you can treat specific spells as if they had the ritual tag, allowing you to add them to your grimoire and cast them as rituals. These spells are marked below.

Spellcasting Ability:
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your ritual spells, since you master your spells through deduction and cunning. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, when you cast an investigator ritual or a spell offered to you by a feature in this class, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC and making an attack roll.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

        <name>Occult Specialization</name>
        <text>Investigators of all stripes share the broad goal of combating the occult, but their methods vary wildly. Some emphasize cutting down monsters and banishing demons, while others believe that uncovering secrets and compiling critical information is the surest method for eliminating supernatural threats. When an investigator gains enough experience, they can steer their approach, including the specific techniques they employ and the trinkets they carry, into an occult specialization, a school of thought for handling eldritch threats.

At 3rd level, you choose a specialization, an area of expertise in handling eldritch threats. Specializations are detailed at the end of the class description. Your specialization choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

Trinkets:
Investigators also collect a number of supernatural trinkets. You must be holding a trinket to activate it.
	Once you use one of your trinkets, you can't use any of them again until you finish a short or long rest.
	As you gain higher levels in this class, you can use your trinkets additional times between rests: You can use them once more at 5th level (2 uses), 11th level (3 uses), and 17th level (4 uses).

Starting at 5th level, once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the target is treated as if it has vulnerability to the weapon's damage. Vulnerability from this feature only doubles your weapon's damage roll and your ability modifier; you don't double extra damage from sources like spells (such as hunter's mark), magic items (such as the extra fire damage of a flame tongue), feats, or class features (such as Sneak Attack).
	Additionally, the attack, as well as all other attacks made against the target until the start of your next turn, count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

When you use your Opportunistic Piety, you choose which effect to create from the list below. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Opportunistic Piety again.

Banish. You cast the banishment spell without expending a spell slot. If the target is a Fey, Fiend, or Undead and fails its saving throw against this spell, it also takes radiant damage equal to your level.

Miracle Healing. As an action, divine light from your hands knit the wounds of a willing creature you touch. That creature regains a number of hit points equal to twice your investigator level. This ability has no effect on Undead or Constructs.

Warding. As an action, you trace a holy symbol on a creature within 5 feet of you, warding it against harm. For the next minute, Aberrations, Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, and Undead that touch the warded creature or hit it with a melee attack take 1d12 radiant damage.

        <name>Occult Specialization: Inquisitor</name>
        <text>An agent of the church that performs exorcisms and roots out heresy.

The church has long been the first line of defense against the tide of impending darkness. Yet, the clergy's stubborn devotion to righteousness impedes them where it counts: you must sometimes be willing to do evil to counter evil. That's where the inquisition comes in.
	As a righteous inquisitor of the faith, you are tasked with rooting out heresy, exorcising demons, and stamping out any sign of the occult, and you are offered clemency for any action you take in the defense of the greater good. You may investigate anyone or anything you deem to be in line with the forces of evil, for you alone are a holy blade in the dark, the arbiter of your church.

        <text>Foretells events of the future using a magical connection to the dead.

As conduits between the living and dead, mediums offer an essential glimpse past the veil of mortality. Using their auguries, seances, and divinations, mediums can retrieve morsels of information from the afterlife to settle debts between the living or dead, and to assist ongoing investigations. This information, however cryptic, can point an interested party toward clues or evidence that only the deceased are able to provide.

Vampires, demons, lycanthropes, and Aberrations all have one thing in common: they are all magical threats, best combated through magical means. To meet these foes on a level playing field, occultists indulge in arcana, filling their grimoires with magical secrets and mastering a handful of spells. Occultists are the most likely investigators to cavort with warlocks, borrow tricks from wizards and magicians, and dabble in dark magic to defeat their foes.

Infiltration, disguise, and lying through their teeth: these are the principal skills of a spy. A talented spy rarely ever needs to draw a dagger to silence someone, for their honeyed words and agreeable disposition are all that is needed to draw out someone's secrets. Of course, when they do strike, it is decisively and without warning. Such skills are invaluable for governments and organizations of all varieties, for stealing confidential information, sabotage, monitoring persons of interest, and everything in between.
