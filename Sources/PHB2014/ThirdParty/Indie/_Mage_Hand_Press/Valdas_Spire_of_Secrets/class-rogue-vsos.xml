        <text>Part spider, part man: swings from webs and stings with venom.

A life-changing event, such as being cursed by a drider warlock or being bitten by a dangerously transmuted arachnid, has imbued you with the properties of a spider. This transformation might have left you physically unchanged, or you could have a half-dozen eyes, lanky and hairy limbs, or a set of inhuman mandibles. Whatever the transformation's side effects, you can now produce deadly poison and ropes of silken web from your palms, and eventually can scale the wall with your fingertips.

        <name>Webbing (Arachnoid Stalker (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you can magically produce sticky, silken spider webs from your palms. You can project a line of web as a bonus action, allowing you to create a temporary rope, pull an unattended object, close doors, or snatch a small object weighing less than 10 pounds within 60 feet. This line of web dissolves after 1 minute. If you project the line of web at a point you can see within 60 feet, you can pull yourself to that point in a straight line. This expends movement and provokes opportunity attacks normally.
	You can use this ability as a reaction when you fall to pull yourself up to 10 feet in any direction, or create a rope of web of up to 60 feet in length and anchor it to a point you choose.

        <text>Starting at 3rd level, you can use a bonus action to magically detach your shadow from your body, allowing it to move independently. Your shadow is a flat, perfectly black silhouette of you that crawls along surfaces. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and immunity to all conditions. It is the same size as you, albeit perfectly flat, and can occupy the same space as other creatures, and vice versa. If your shadow makes a saving throw or an ability check to interact with the environment, it uses your bonus for the roll.
	In combat, your shadow acts on your turns and follows your commands. You can command your shadow on each of your turns to move up to 30 feet along the walls or floor (no action required). Your shadow doesn't attack, but can interact with objects and counts as an ally for the purposes of Sneak Attack.
	Your shadow vanishes if it drops to 0 hit points, if it is within the area of light created by a spell of 1st level or higher, or if it is ever more than 60 feet from you. Once it vanishes, your shadow reappears at your heels at the end of your next turn.
	If your shadow enters a heavily obscured area or one of magical darkness, it is effectively invisible. Your shadow can appear to be the shadow of other creatures and act convincingly using your Charisma (Performance) or Charisma (Deception) skill.

If your shadow is within 5 feet of the shadow of another creature you can see, you can use your bonus action to command it to use one of the following abilities:

	• Your shadow makes an attack against the shadow of another creature. Your shadow uses Dexterity for its attack rolls and has proficiency with its shadowy weapons. On a hit against the creature's AC, the creature takes 2d6 damage. This damage counts as magical and its type matches the weapon you are carrying if it deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, or deals bludgeoning damage otherwise.

	• Your shadow grapples the shadow of another creature. Your shadow can use your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check for its grapple check and the target makes its grapple check as normal. If your shadow succeeds, the creature is grappled until the end of its next turn.

	• Your shadow hooks onto the heels of another creature, becoming its second shadow until the end of its next turn. If you see the creature make an attack while your shadow is on its heels, you can use your reaction to cause the shadow to leap in the way, becoming the target of the attack.

Size:
While Titan Slayers can be members of any race, the GM can optionally limit access to this archetype to races of appropriate size. Halflings and gnomes are far better at slipping between the legs of their opponents and crawling up their backs than most humans are.
