    <description>The Very Young Green Dragon originally appeared in Dragons! Volume 1 - Chromatic Dragons. Dragons! Volume 1 - Chromatic Dragons and Volume 2 - Metallic Dragons expand the age categories of 5th Edition dragons, adding six new age categories for each dragon type, up to and including a CR 30 Great Wyrm Red Dragon! The name of the game, after all, is Dungeons and Dragons, not Dungeons and Tarrasques, so a dragon should be at the top of the food chain, dontcha think?

    <description>Levexi's skills were noticed early by Rerecross, and she was put in charge of the commando drake patrols. Her determined training improved her skills and the skills of her troops, making the kobolds of Krag Canyon formidable foes.

As a reward for her skills, was permitted to claim an item discovered mounted over the bar in Crag Kragen's estate - a Hunting Rifle with exceptional range. She also salvaged several ten round clips and several hundred rounds. After a significant amount of dangerous experimentation she figured out how the rifle worked and became a truly lethal threat. At any given time she has five ten round clips on her. She has five more clips and two hundred rounds in a locked chest in her quarters. It is unknown how the gnome Crag Kragen came in possession of such a wonder.

Levexi is never far from her hunting drake Xip. The two work well together and Xip enjoys pouncing on enemies from above when Levexi is drawing their attention.

    <description>Even as long-lived as they are, all dragons must eventually die. This thought doesn't sit well with many dragons, some of which allow themselves to be transformed by necromantic energy and ancient rituals into powerful undead dracoliches. Only the most narcissistic dragons choose this path, knowing that by doing so, they sever all ties to their kin and the dragon gods.

Sarinox the Weak? As noted in the adventure, Sarinox, when encountered, doesn't have her full strength. This is reflected in her low Constitution score, and, if a game mechanic is required one can think that each innocent soul she consumes grants her another point of constitution. DMs should feel free to adjust her hit points as needed, perhaps even mid-combat, to make this the climactic scene it should be. What I'm saying is fudge the hit points so that Sarinox survives until the party is on its last, desperate legs before striking the fatal blow.
