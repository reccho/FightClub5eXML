    <description>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.

Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.

Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.

Arix is the spiritual leader of Murk's kobold clan. She's also an excellent cook. Arix knows that Tiamat guides her actions, and that said guidance is to protect Murk. Arix would do anything to keep Murk alive. Arix is suspicious of strangers and thinks the worst of them. As such she avoids the common areas when Severastri is tending to guests.

Malcan is commander of the guard for the kobold clan. He is hard and stern and expects total obedience from the lesser kobolds when the clan is under assault. Though absolutely loyal to Severastri and Arix Malcan is quite convinced that things would be better if he were in charge.

In combat Malcan charges in unafraid, ready to throw up a shield spell should it be needed.
