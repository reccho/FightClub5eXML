    <trait>
      <name>Cavalry Training</name>
      <text>When the Crawler Commando hits a target with a melee attack while mounted on a Carrion Crawler, the Crawler can make a melee attack against the same target as a reaction.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Crawler Commando</name>
      <text>The Duergar has advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks relating to Carrion Crawlers. Mounting Carrion Crawlers costs the Commando 5 feet of movement, rather than half its speed. Special saddles and harnesses allow the Duegar to guide the Crawler without his hands, leaving his hands free for weapon and shield use. These harnesses keep the Duergar mounted even if the Crawler is upside down.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Duergar Resilience</name>
      <text>The Duergar has advantage on saving throws against poison, spells, and illusions, as well as to resist being charmed.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Enlarge Mount</name>
      <text>If the Duergar uses its Enlarge action while mounted on a Crawler, the effect can Enlarge the Crawler as well.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Invisible Mount</name>
      <text>If the Duegar uses its Invisibility action while mounted on a Crawler, the effect makes the Crawler invisible as well. The effect is broken for both Duegar and Crawler if the Crawler attacks.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Sunlight Sensitivity</name>
      <text>While in sunlight, the Duergar has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks.</text>
    </trait>
    <action>
      <name>Warhammer</name>
      <text>Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) versatile 8 (1d10 + 3) bludgeoning damage, or 12 (2d8 + 3) versatile 14 (2d10 + 3) bludgeoning damage while enlarged.</text>

    <action>
      <name>Javelin</name>
      <text>Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage or 9 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage while enlarged.</text>

    <action>
      <name>Enlarge (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)</name>
      <text>For 1 minute, the Duergar magically increases in size, along with anything it is wearing or carrying. While enlarged, the Duergar is Large, doubles its damage dice on Strength-based weapon attacks (included in the attacks), and makes Strength checks and Strength saving throws with advantage. If the Duergar lacks the room to become Large, it attains the maximum size possible in the space available.</text>
    </action>
    <action>
      <name>Invisibility (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)</name>
      <text>The Duergar (And mount) magically turns invisible until it attacks, casts a spell, or uses its Enlarge, or until its concentration is broken, up to 1 hour (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the Duergar wears or carries is invisible with it.</text>
    </action>
    <description>Duegar Crawler Commandos are the long range scouts, shock troops, and special forces of the Duegar.
