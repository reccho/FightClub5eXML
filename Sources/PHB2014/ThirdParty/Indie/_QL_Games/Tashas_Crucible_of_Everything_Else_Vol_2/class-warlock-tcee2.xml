        <name>Otherworldly Patron: The Ancient Wyrm (HB)</name>
        <text>It has been your privilege to make a pact with an ancient dragon of untold power. They reside elsewhere--on an Elemental Plane, in the Elemental Chaos, or in a demiplane of their own creation, for example--but you are their emissary and agent on the Material Plane. Your patron has charged you with furthering their agenda, which generally amounts to glorifying their name, spreading respect for dragonkind, and gathering wealth on their behalf. In exchange for your loyalty and regular tribute, your patron grants you a sliver of their magical influence and prowess.
	As dragons are ambitious creatures, and only grow more so as they age, your patron is virtually guaranteed to have one or more rivals of comparable might. They might seek to outdo or embarrass each other, or eliminate each other's forces in a centuries-long game of cat-and-mouse. Whatever their intrigues may be, you are a crucial part of them, though the details may be kept from you.
	Notable dragons that you may have the pleasure to serve include the gold dragon Lareth, the King of Justice; the red dragon Balagos, the Flying Flame; and the silver dragon Mithbarakaz, the Mithral Shield.

        <name>Treasure Sense (The Ancient Wyrm (HB))</name>
        <text>You can detect the nearby presence of valuables. As an action, you can sense the location and approximate monetary value of any objects within 30 feet that are your Dragon Type's favored treasure. This sense passes through full cover.

        <text>Whenever you make a spell attack, you can choose to change the damage type to the one associated with your Dragon Type.
	When you reach 3rd level in this class, you learn the dragon's breath spell. It is a warlock spell for you and does not count against the number of spells you know. You can cast it once at its lowest level without using a spell slot, and may do so again after you finish a long rest.

        <name>Compelled Tribute (The Ancient Wyrm (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 6th level, you can demand tribute from others as if your patron were speaking through you. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 10 feet. The creature must be able to hear you and understand a language, but you do not need to share a language. If the creature fails a Wisdom saving throw, it must give you one item of your choosing on its person that you can see. The item must be held or worn, and if worn must be easily removable (for example, a ring or a cloak, but not armor). Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you've completed a short or long rest.

	When a creature moves within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to force it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened of you until the start of your next turn. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you've completed a short or long rest.

        <name>Draconic Avatar (The Ancient Wyrm (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 14th level, you can call forth a powerful avatar of your patron as an action. You must conduct a 1-hour ritual to prepare this feature, which can be done as part of a short or long rest and only prepares this feature for 24 hours. This ceremony consumes 500 gp worth of treasure, or half that if the treasure is the patron's favored treasure.
	To summon the draconic avatar, you must spend a warlock spell slot. It acts on its own initiative count and obeys your commands (no action required by you). You can communicate with it telepathically as long as it is within 60 feet of you. It disappears after 1 minute, if you or it are reduced to 0 hit points, or if you dismiss it early as an action.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Otherworldly Patron: The Cryptic Oracle (HB)</name>
        <text>Your patron is a being of inscrutable intellect and an immortal guardian of forgotten knowledge. Such beings often fiercely guard these secrets in long-buried sanctums and lost temples. Others have minds that exist outside of time, simultaneously seeing what has been and what is yet to come, passing on this foresight to those they deem worthy. Some are simply bored, and will often bestow great boons or terrible curses upon those who succeed or fail their riddles.
	Beings that forge such pacts with mortals might include sphinxes, mummy lords, nagas or even powerful spellcasters on the cusp of godhood. Maybe you have impressed such a creature and as a reward they have imparted you a sliver of their power, imparting some of their great knowledge upon you. Or perhaps you answered a riddle incorrectly and now must serve their whims, sent out into the world to obtain obscure knowledge and secrets for your master.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Rule of Three (The Cryptic Oracle (HB))</name>
        <text>You can deliver riddles with your patron's power to aid your allies or confound your foes. As a bonus action, choose a creature other than you that is within 60 feet of you. If the creature can hear and understand you, it must make an Intelligence saving throw against your warlock spell save DC to attempt to solve the riddle.
	If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can choose to grant it a boon, which the creature can spend to gain advantage on one type of roll of your choice: an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, you can either grant yourself the boon, or cause the creature to suffer a curse in the form of disadvantage on its next roll of the chosen type. The boon or curse fades when the roll is made, or when the recipient finishes a long rest.
	You can use this feature three times, and you regain all expended uses of it whenever you finish a long rest. Each time you use it, you must choose a different type of roll.

        <text>You can discover secrets by getting into places few others can. As an action, you can teleport to a space within 30 feet of you. You travel the distance in a form of your choosing, perhaps as a fine stream of sand, snow, or glowing runes. You don't need to see your destination, provided there is a path to it (at least 1 inch wide) within 30 feet of you. If the targeted space is occupied, the action fails, but your use of the feature isn't expended.

        <text>You can force your enemies into a contest of wits with your patron. As an action, choose a creature within 60 feet of you. That creature is teleported across time and space to your patron's domain, where it must answer three perplexing riddles. While before your patron, the creature is incapacitated.
	At the start of its next turn, the creature must make three consecutive Intelligence saving throws against your warlock spell save DC. If the creature fails any of its saving throws, it is hurled through time and space, either into the past or future of a plane of your patron's choice and according to its whims. For each failed save, the creature takes 3d10 psychic damage and ages by 1 year, but its statistics otherwise remain the same.
	At the end of the creature's turn, it reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

        <name>Otherworldly Patron: The Great Ooze (HB)</name>
        <text>Your patron is an ancient and powerful ooze. Unlike the average ooze, whose existence is driven by mindless consumption, your ancient patron has developed powerful psychic abilities and has bestowed the traits of their unusual form upon your body. Often these entities will sow their yearning for destruction within you, compelling you to seep your way into the world on their behalf.
	Beings of this type might include one of the original offspring of the demon lord Juiblex or a denizen of the Swamp of Oblivion the para-elemental plane of ooze. In Eberron, Kyrzin the Daelkyr is one such being. It could also be an ooze from a time before even the gods - primordial leftovers from the soup of creation.
