Hit: 25 (10d4) piercing damage or half that if the swarm has half its hit points or fewer, and the swarm attaches to the target. While attached, the swarm doesn't attack. Instead, at the start of each of the swarm's turns, the target loses 25 (10d4) hit points due to blood loss, or half that if the swarm has half its hit point or fewer.

The swarm can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. It does so after it drains 50 hit points of blood from the target or the target dies. A creature, including the target, can use its action to attempt to remove the stirges. This requires a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.</text>
