        <text>Monks of the Way of Devils are part of an ancient and unholy order, one dedicated to serving the legions of devils in their war against the demons of the abyss, as well as serving their infernal masters' interests on the Material Plane. Whereas most monks train in the art of self-defense, those of the Way of Devils focus on inflicting punishment and controlling their enemies. It is said that the first of these monks were Duergar, newly bound into pacts with Asmodeus and willing to wield his devilish chains over the prospect of becoming chained themselves.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Devilish Chain (Way of Devils (HB))</name>
        <text>You gain the ability to summon a spectral, fiendish chain of burning iron to attack and bind your foes. Whenever you take the Attack action, you can summon the chain to your empty hand and use it for the attack. The chain uses the statistics of a whip, but with a reach of 15 feet, and it counts as a monk weapon for you. You can only have one chain summoned at a time. It disappears after 1 minute, if you are reduced to 0 hit points, or if you dismiss it early as a bonus action.
	Additionally, whenever you hit a creature with your chain, you can spend 1 ki point to apply one of the following effects. You can only use one of these effects each time you make an attack with the chain.

Binding Chain. The creature must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained until the start of your next turn and cannot move more than 15 feet away from you. A creature restrained by the chain can use its action to make a Strength saving throw, freeing itself on a success. While a creature is restrained in this way, you cannot use the chain to make other attacks.

Burning Chain. You deal an additional acid, cold, or fire damage (your choice when you use this feature) equal to one martial arts die.

Luring Chain. If the creature is one size larger than you or smaller, you pull the creature up to 10 feet closer to you.

When you restrain a target using the Binding Chain option from your Devilish Chain feature, you can spend an additional 2 ki points to change the duration of the restraining effect to 1 minute. The creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. On a failed save, it takes 2d6 of acid, cold, or fire damage (your choice).

        <text>Monks of the Way of the Cosmic Mind learn to harness their ki to create fantastical telepathic and telekinetic effects. Githzerai are among this tradition's most common practitioners, but followers can be found throughout many peoples across many planes.
	All creatures have latent innate psionic abilities, but very few ever unlock the secrets which lie beyond sentience. Monks who dedicate their lives to the mastery of their own mind eventually learn to produce incredible telepathic and telekinetic effects.

On a failed save, you, your equipment, and your mage hand are invisible and silent to them for 1 minute. On a successful save, nothing happens. You know whether each target fails or succeeds on its save.

        <text>As an action, you can spend 4 ki points and punch a hole in the fabric of reality. Every creature within 10 feet of you, besides yourself, must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 8d12 force damage and moves forward in time. A target moved forward in time vanishes until the start of your next turn. When the effect ends, the target reappears in the space it left or in an unoccupied space nearest to that space if it is occupied. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects.

        <text>Form is fluid. Shape is a weapon. Release yourself from the constraints of your body and you can become made for war. Thus teaches the way of the warshaper, whose members learn how to alter their form on the fly. Though they do not focus on the full transformations that a druid's wild shape might, they can grow claws and teeth, flow around attacks, rebuild their shattered body, and other similar changes.
	Monks who follow the way of the warshaper are often forthright defenders of the downtrodden, but not always. Their control over their own form can make them relentless, terrifying hunters able to infiltrate past defenders and terminate their targets without fail.

        <text>You have mastered the core techniques of warshaping, allowing you to rebuild your body into whatever you need it to do at the time. When you use your Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, or Step of the Wind monk features, you can choose to shift your form into some- thing more suited to your action.

Flurry of Blows. You grow natural weapons such as claws and teeth or otherwise shift part of your body into a weapon, such as a bone spike. Choose bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing; until the start of your next turn, your unarmed attacks deal damage of the chosen type. In addition, if you hit a single target with both attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows feature, you deal extra damage to the target equal to one Martial Arts die.

Patient Defense. You grow a hard shell, resilient scales, or another natural defense feature. You have resistance to the damage of the first attack that hits you before the start of your next turn.

Step of the Wind. You grow small wings, gliding flaps, or some other feature that helps you travel through the air. Until the end of your turn, your jumping distance triples instead of doubles and you are immune to damage from falling.

        <name>Ancient Warbeast (Way of the Warshaper (HB))</name>
        <text>You have mastered the techniques required to remold your form and gain the powers of an ancient warbeast. You can assume this new form as a bonus action. This form lasts for 1 hour, until you are reduced to zero hit points, or until you dismiss the effect as an action. While you are in this form, you gain the following benefits.

	• Your size is Large.

	• If your Strength score is lower than your Dexterity score, it increases to match your Dexterity score.

	• Your Martial Arts die is 1d12.

	• Your unarmed attacks deal your choice of bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage.

	• You gain darkvision for a radius of 120 feet, tremorsense for a radius of 60 feet, or blindsight for a radius of 30 feet (your choice when you transform).

You can choose the details of the appearance of this form each time you assume it. A terrifying hybrid of humanoid and ancient beast that time forgot is the most common. You might choose to take the form of a six-legged beast with savage claws and bloodshot eyes, a shaggy-furred minotaur with great piercing horns, a scaled serpentine body with eerily muscular arms extending from below its head, or any other beast form hybrid you can imagine. Once you have used this feature, you may not do so again until you finish a long rest.
