        <name>Martial Archetype: Phoenix Knight (HB)</name>
        <text>A Phoenix Knight has looked into myth and drawn inspiration from it. They have a burning passion for combat and protecting those closest to them. Through intense training and careful practice, they have learned how to channel this inner fire into something tangible.
	These fighters know how to harness their fire in order to retaliate against foes and heal friends. As their mastery grows, they can cauterize wounds with their flames and even emit powerful waves of heat.
	Those who mimic a phoenix have a fondness for flame and warmth. They relish sunlight and bonfires. They sometimes find themselves staring into fire, imagining enemies igniting and the wounds of allies cauterizing within the popping embers and dancing flames. Sometimes, if they stare hard enough, they can almost see feathers amid the ashes.

        <name>Aura of Flame (Phoenix Knight (HB))</name>
        <text>The spark you ignited inside you sometimes bursts, warming your body and burning those who would wish you harm. As a Bonus Action, you can cause small embers to dance across your body for 1 minute. Once per turn, when a creature damages you with a melee attack, you can deal fire damage to them equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1).
	You can increase the light that the embers emit at will, creating bright light within 5 feet and dim light for 5 feet beyond that
	In addition, creatures without resistance or immunity to fire damage have disadvantage when grappling you, and you have advantage when trying to break out of the grapple.
	Beginning at 10th level, you can use this feature twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

        <name>From the Embers (Phoenix Knight (HB))</name>
        <text>Just as a phoenix rises from ashes, so too do you rise more easily from death. The revivify, raise dead, and reincarnation spells require no material components to revive you.
	In addition, when you succeed on a death saving throw or are stabilized while unconscious, you can regain hit points equal to your level in this class. Once you have used this feature, you may not do so again until you finish a long rest.

        <name>Fan the Flames (Phoenix Knight (HB))</name>
        <text>Your mastery over the fire that inhabits your body has grown to such an extent that you can project the flames outward.

	In addition, your mastery over your own flames protects you from external sources. You gain immunity to fire damage.
