      <name>Rugged Recreation</name>
      <text>Most Ibexi do not care for the pomp and circumstance of fine art and poetry, although they have their own artforms. Rich oral histories recount tales of ancient gods creating them from the stones of the mountains, and elegant dance ceremonies offer fealty to these nature spirits. In their free time, many Ibexis enjoy friendly wrestling matches and footraces, and hold jubilant dances to traditional folk music at least once a month.

Ibexi Sports. Ibexi love to be active, and their enjoy- ment is multiplied exponentially when others join them in their romping pastimes. Favorite activities include the standard stick-pull (though many prefer a variation where you join hooves instead of hold a stick), leg wrestling (the loser is often just as pleased to be thrown as the winner is to win), footbag (which can sometimes go for hours, often with rules conjured on the fly), and "tree-tussles" (where one or two contestants form a "tree" by standing on the shoulders of another, and they try to dismantle the other "trees'' without breaking their own form).
	Usually good natured in their escapades, Ibexi characters will often challenge allies to friendly athletic competitions, and may become sad and unhealthy if they do not experience regular physical activity and bond with others through sport.</text>

      <text>Some say that the dead-gray mist began in Metrol, initially flowing out of the royal palaces of Vermishard. Others swear that the disaster began in the Cannith stronghold Making. All that is known is that the mist swiftly spread across the kingdom, transforming the lands and creatures caught within it. Over a million people died in the Mourning, including nearly all of the inhabitants of central Cyre. The mist slowed its advance as it spread, and some of those in the borderlands heard of the disaster in time to flee. Others survived because they were already beyond the borders of Cyre; the mist stopped mere feet away from the camps of Cyran soldiers holding sections of the Brelish front.
	But, as is the case with these types of disasters, a rare few inexplicably survived. These are the Mourntouched. This is you.

Did you find other survivors and form a motley band? Did you come across the followers of the Lord of Blades, who kept you safe from monsters after old warforged friends vouched for your good character? What did you eat and drink? What sorts of terrible scenes did you witness as you trekked to safety?

2 | Your veins are silver and glow faintly under the light of a full moon.
3 | You cannot grow hair.
4 | You were weak, elderly, and on your deathbed when disaster struck. When you awoke, you were young and sprightly, and the people around you had been turned to glass.
5 | Your eyes have turned to amber gemstones, with swirling veins of golden light within.
6 | Your skin is translucent and light blue.
7 | You appear completely identical to your previous form, but others feel strange and uncomfortable around you anyways. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of illusion magic about you.
8 | You appear to be of a different race now. You can choose the race or roll on the New Race table to determine which.
9 | You've grown small wings on your back. They are not large enough for flight. You may choose their appearance, such as feathery, scaly, or bat-like.
10 | Your ears have grown elf-like points.
11 | You have grown or shrunk 2 or more feet. You may need to change your size from Medium to Small, or vice versa.

      <name>Family Centric</name>
      <text>Ratpeople value close family bonds. They work together to keep their nests clean and put food on the table. Extended families often live together; it isn't uncommon for one family to have two grandparents, several aunts and uncles, and tens of grandchildren all living in a small area.

      <text>A modron unit sometimes becomes defective, either through natural decay or exposure to chaotic forces. These units may become violent criminals, may contemplate abstract concepts like love or metaphysics while continuing their work, or may pursue any number of other new behaviors. When such modrons are discovered, Primus likes to meet with them.
	During this meeting, Primus will try them for any crimes committed. These trials are fair, brief, and comprehensive. After the trial, if the modron has been deemed a violent criminal, it is lovingly sent to a rehabilitation clinic. Noncriminal and rehabilitated modrons are given a choice continue to function in modron society as best they can or be given a complete autonomy and humanity. Those who choose humanity undergo a magical transformation of body, mind, and spirit, and often go to the material plane to pursue a life of free agency or to a rogue modron colony on any of the myriad of planes.
	As a peculiar people, rogue modrons have peculiar habits. Going from a life of complete law and order to the neutral mishmash of the material plane is one of the greatest culture shocks in the known multiverse. Many rogue modrons develop unique idiosyncrasies that others may find equally irritating and endearing. The Rogue Modron Quirks table lists examples that can provide inspiration for quirks of your modron characters.

Rogue Modron Quirks:

1 | You are obsessed with the number 17 and see connections to it everywhere you go.
2 | You are unable to recognize your reflection.
3 | You keep small bugs in a hollow compartment in your foot.
4 | You are fluent in Morse code. You have yet to find a plane of existence that uses it.
5 | You are prone to fits of self expression, where you are compelled to draw or paint on the nearest unmoving surface.
6 | You march in place when not moving.
7 | Once per day at random, you eject a small metallic disc.
8 | You have found and keep precious a sex of six polyhedral dice. They remind you of home.
9 | You repeat the final three words of every sentence you speak, but in reverse.
10 | Whenever you see a new type of food for the first time, you take exact measurements of every dimension and add it to a catalogue you keep.

      <name>Quilled and Nimble</name>
      <text>Covered in razor-sharp quills on their head, shoulders, and back, rollic have lithe, yet broad bodies with double jointed legs and a wolf-like head.
	Due to how long their quills stick out of their back, they don't use chairs, instead preferring to sit cross legged.
	Their skin and quills are usually brown, black, or tan, though some are white or have reddish hues, occasion ally in striped or mottled patterns. Many tribes paint their quills in unique patterns, sometimes with other colors such as a bold yellow or orange, which look stunning as rollic leap, curl up, and somersault through the air. When hunting, many paint their quills green like pine needles or entangle plants into them to act as camouflage.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Fiercely Competitive</name>
      <text>Thrilling and intense sports are a near-daily activity among rollic, used for entertainment, establishing honor, and even determining tribal leadership. Such activities include performing somersaults, flips, and stunts while throwing quills at targets; wrestling by entangling their quills together; or carrying, kicking, and throwing basket-woven balls.
	The intense nature of these sports often make rollic extremely aggressive when participating, building a fearless spirit. This becomes valuable in times of war against invaders or enemy tribes.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Precise Gestures</name>
      <text>Rollic frequently use unique gestures to greet and communicate with others, many of which are universal among rollic, even in enemy tribes. Rollic who venture to other civilizations are often easily confused by the different gestures used by outsiders, especially with the countless slight variations of how people shake hands or wave to each other. Here are just a few examples of gestures rollic use:

Greeting a Commoner. To greet each other, rollic cross both arms in front of their chest and bow. The right arm goes in front for greetings. The left arm goes in front for farewells.

Greeting a Chieftain. As a sign of respect to their leader, rollic run two fingers across the right side of their forehead. Outsiders often confused this with running two fingers across the left side of their forehead, which is how rollic declare sworn enemies.

Complimenting a Service. After receiving a satisfying meal or other service, rollic gives thanks by inhaling while clicking their tongues exactly six or twelve times, depending on how satisfied the rollic is. Delivering any other number of clicks or exhaling instead or means the meal or service was inadequate in some way.

Requesting Aid. When asking someone for aid, a rollic first places their right hand on the other person's right shoulder, makes direct eye contact, then presses their forehead to the other person's forehead. Outsiders often find such close contact extremely discomforting. Using the other arm or reaching for the wrong shoulder are both insults.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Isolated Origins</name>
      <text>Prejudice against their kind led rollic to retreat into secluded tribes far from other civilizations. When other races come across them, more aggressive tribes might capture and force them to fight in a formal duel before letting them free again. Those victorious in battle who spare their opponent are immediately made friends of the tribe and are offered to be taught their ways. It is difficult to gain the trust of a rollic, but once obtained, they are fiercely loyal.
	Rollic tribes usually live within verdant forests in burrow-like huts or lodges crafted from wood, mud, and plaster. Others are more nomadic, favoring more temporary and mobile structures such as tents and lean-tos.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>For Honor and Tribe</name>
      <text>From birth, rollic are taught that serving the tribe is the only way to achieve true internal and external peace. Even those with little experience will fight to defend and protect. Elders and leaders are to be respected.
	Those who dishonor or betray the tribe's trust, even accidentally, are banished. An ousted rollic will often seek out a way to serve a greater cause or reach a grand achievement that might restore their honor. These rollic will pursue it before all else, and be sure they have evidence to prove their deeds upon their return. Others who feel betrayed by their tribe and their attempts at maintaining honor may abandon it entirely, seeking more chaotic paths and refusing leadership as a way to oppose their past ways.

1 | I cheated in a tribal sporting event and was ousted for my crime.

4 | An outsider stole a tribal relic and I must retrieve it.
5 | Chasing honor in the tribe left me with nothing. I seek another path.

Tribe names, when translated, usually reflect the quill color or patterns of the tribe. Elders and leaders of the tribe have three syllables instead.

Rollic Names: Hrolu, Ghrato, Sxerhi, Naxu, Vochna, Buxleh

Rollic Tribes: Black Quill, Red Stripe, Pine Needle, Bark Coat

If an outsider's name doesn't have two syllables, rollic will often adapt their name, removing or adding syllables to make sure it has two.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Red Elf. Rugged Elf. Were-elf. The Taleyri bear many names, most stemming from confusion and misunder standing. This largely has to do with their appearance, which is unique among the elvish people, for they are built more solidly than their kin. Muscular frames and taller height place them more in the vicinity of humans, but their bodies and faces are covered in soft, red fur, and their prominent canines suggest a far different ancestry. In truth, the Taleyri are even stranger than most people assume, for they are not a true race them selves.
	The Taleyri begin life as regular elves. Indeed, they are elves, indistinguishable from their families and neighbors. Through trance they experience some of their past lives, tied to that eternal flow of reincarnation that is their elven heritage. An elf only becomes one of the Taleyri by undergoing a sacred, transformative rite. This rite must be undertaken willingly, for it takes that elf and all of its past selves and forever removes them from Corellon's cycle of reincarnation. The elf, now one of the Taleyri, is endowed with enhanced strength and supernatural defenses, all the better to defend elven conclaves and other sacred sites.

      <name>Gifts of the Goddess</name>
      <text>Of the creatures that lurk in the night, evil lycanthropes are among the worst. They prey upon the races and spread their vile curse from victim to victim. The patron deity of such monsters, Malar, has a particular hatred for the Seldarine and the elvish people. He once attacked Corellon Larethian in his own home of Arvandor and nearly killed the First of the Seldarine. Malar's failure of that hunt has eaten at him ever since, and he drives his worshipers to hunt elves at every opportunity.
	This enmity prompted Sehanine Moonbow to create the ritual whereby elves could become Taleyri. With greater physical strength and protection against curses, these volunteers could stand toe-to-toe against the raiding lycanthropes. Even when struck down, they could become guardians of knowledge and wisdom as great sentient trees.
	Aside from the newfound strength and red fur, the most important gift the Taleyri receive is a more intimate relationship with their past lives. The Taleyri have no need to trance, for they can commune at any time with their previous selves, though the insight they gain is often clouded or enigmatic. A mortal mind can only hold so much knowledge at one time. Instead, their consciousness goes out to nearby animals and bonds with them, seeing what they see until the Taleyri awaken.</text>

      <text>When one of the Taleyri dies, a strange and wonderful event occurs. From the body sprouts a sapling that will one day become an enormous, sentient tree. Such a tree holds the entire memory of all the original elf's past lives. Some elves would mourn at the thought of being removed from the reincarnation cycle, to have their soul's progress forever halted. The Taleyri, however, see all of this as a noble sacrifice, for each tree becomes a living repository of knowledge and wisdom that benefits all those who come with questions to be answered.</text>

      <text>This is a variant of the Kobold race found in Volo's Guide to Monsters and other official Wizards of the Coast products.
	Kobolds are often dismissed as cowardly, foolish, and weak, but these little reptilian creatures actually have a strong social structure that stresses devotion to the tribe, are clever with their hands, and viciously work together in order to overcome their physical limitations.
	In the kobolds' version of a perfect world, the creatures would be left alone to dig their tunnels and raise the next generation of kobolds, all the while seeking the magic that will free their imprisoned god (see the "Kurtulmak: God of Kobolds" sidebar). In the world they occupy, kobolds are often bullied and enslaved by larger creatures-or, when they live on their own, they are constantly fearful of invasion and oppression. Although individually they are timid and shy away from conflict, kobolds are dangerous if cornered, vicious when defending their eggs, and notorious for the dangerous improvised traps they use to protect their warrens.

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>This is a variant of the Orc race found in Volo's Guide to Monsters, Eberron: Rising from the Last War, and other official Wizards of the Coast products.
	To feel the thunder of orcish war drums outside the gate and to hear a chorus of voices growling, "Gruumsh!" is the nightmare of every civilized place in the world. For no matter how thick its walls, skilled its archers, or brave its knights, few settlements have ever withstood a full-scale onslaught of orcs.
	Every soldier who lives through a fight with orcs tells of confronting a hulking foe that can cleave through a warrior with a single blow, part of a force that can cut down enemies as though they were trembling stalks of wheat before the scythe. Only a skilled and determined hero can hope to survive single combat with an orc.
	Savage and fearless, orc tribes are ever in search of elves, dwarves, and humans to destroy. Motivated by their hatred of the civilized races of the world and their need to satisfy the demands of their deities, the orcs know that if they fight well and bring glory to their tribe, Gruumsh will call them home to the plane of Acheron. It is there in the afterlife where the chosen ones will join Gruumsh and his armies in their endless extraplanar battle for supremacy.

      <name>Blessed By the Cave Mother</name>
      <text>Even larger than their orcish cousins, orogs are said to be blessed by Luthic herself with greater strength and intelligence, destined to become hardy warrior-leaders. Orogs are accustomed to being shown deference by the other members of their tribes, and their whims are given nearly as much heed as the war chief's own orders.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Away From the Tribe</name>
      <text>Orogs who leave their orcish tribes (and the influence of the evil deities that rule them) most often find work as elite mercenaries or bodyguards. They often find that the other races underestimate their cleverness, thinking them only to be large brutes and that gives the orogs an advantage that is sure to be as enlightening as it is surprising.</text>
