        <text>Some wizards dedicate their lives to studying negative energies, chthonic planes, and fiends of all types. These mages are known for their acumen in navigating devilish agreements, wresting demon power, and hunting fiends of all kinds. Those who immerse themselves in the mantle of the hellhunter enter into a lifelong pursuit of understanding, harnessing, and utilizing all power that becomes available to them through the wicked realms of existence by any means possible. Tasha herself is a hellhunter who has garnered quite a reputation amongst the fiends of the negative planes, known for outmaneuvering archdevils and strong arming even the most powerful demon princes.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Call the Abyss (Hellhunter (HB))</name>
        <text>As an action, you can spend a spell slot to summon a fiend of your choice in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. The maximum Challenge Rating for a fiend summoned in this way is the level of the spell slot used, and you can only have one fiend summoned at a time. Such a fiend is under no obliga- tion to listen to you or follow your commands, and it cannot summon other fiends. If one of these fiends is reduced to 0 hit points, it disappears in a cloud of dust and reforms on its native plane in 1d12 days. It returns to where it came from after 1 hour. As an action, you can attempt to dismiss the fiend early. It must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or else be dismissed to wherever it was summoned from. It has disadvantage on this saving throw if you say its true name.

Roleplaying Devils. A devil (lawful evil) typically won't attack anything when summoned, at least not at first. It tries to make agreements and will keep its promises, if only on a technicality. Devils represent tyranny and are native to the Nine Hells of Baator.

Roleplaying Demons. A demon (chaotic evil) typically is hostile to all creatures other than itself. Regardless of its Intelligence, it usually tries to attack anything in sight and will not make promises. Demons represent anarchy and are native to the Abyss.

Roleplaying Yugoloths. A yugoloth (neutral evil) is typically indifferent to being summoned, but can quickly become hostile or friendly. It will lend its services to the highest bidder and will change its allegiances if it finds a better offer. Yugoloths represent self-interest and are native to Gehenna.

Long Memories. If you summon the same fiend more than once, be wary. Fiends have long memories and will remember how you've treated them in the past.

        <name>Arcane Tradition: Mimicry (HB)</name>
        <text>The mimic. A devious hunter, every rogue's nightmare, and the last thing some creatures see before being swallowed whole. The first mimics were created by powerful mages, and they were intelligent creatures, combining tactical prowess with an all-consuming hunger to create terrifying and powerful devourers. While the secrets of how to create those beings have been lost to time, some mages have passed down a similar tradition that allows even novice wizards to create the monstrosities that many dungeon delvers have become familiar with, commanding these monstrosities as subordinates through sheer power of will.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Transmogrify (Mimicry (HB))</name>
        <text>As an action, you can spend a spell slot and touch a nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried to turn it into an experimental mimic of the same size. This mimic uses the Arcane Mimic stat block, found below. Some details of this stat block vary based on the spell slot used to create the mimic and the size of the mimic, as described in the Transmogrification and Arcane Mimics tables.
	The spell slot used determines the mimic's Strength score and the maximum size of item you can trans- mogrify, according to the Transmogrification table. The mimic's size determines its hit points and the bludgeoning or piercing damage dealt by its attacks, according to the Arcane Mimics table.
	The change lasts for 1 hour, until the mimic is reduced to 0 hit points, or until you dismiss the effect as an action. You can only have one mimic created in this way at a time. You can communicate with your mimic telepathically as long as it is within 120 feet of you.
	In combat, the mimic takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal or telepathic commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it moves toward the nearest hostile creature and bites it if possible.

Transmogrification:
Spell Slot Used | Maximum Size | Strength
1st | Tiny | 12 (+1)
2nd | Small | 14 (+2)
3rd | Medium | 16 (+3)
4th | Medium | 18 (+4)
5th | Large | 20 (+5)
6th | Large | 22 (+6)
7th | Huge | 24 (+7)
8th | Huge | 26 (+7)
9th | Gargantuan | 28 (+9)

Arcane Mimics:
Mimic Size | Hit Points | Attack Damage
Tiny | 4 times the level of the spell slot used | 1d4 + the mimic's Strength modifier
Small | 6 times the level of the spell slot used | 1d6 + the mimic's Strength modifier
Medium | 8 times the level of the spell slot used | 1d8 + the mimic's Strength modifier
Large | 10 times the level of the spell slot used | 2d8 + the mimic's Strength modifier
Huge | 12 times the level of the spell slot used | 3d8 + the mimic's Strength modifier
Gargantuan | 20 times the level of the spell slot used | 4d8 + the mimic's Strength modifier

        <text>Once you spend enough time in mimic slobber, you just kind of get used to it. You gain resistance to acid damage.
	Additionally, you can have up to two arcane mimics created at a time. As a bonus action, you can expend a spell slot to magically heal one of your arcane mimics within 120 feet of you. The arcane mimic heals for a number of d8s equal to the level of the spell slot expended.

        <name>Polymorph Proficiency (Mimicry (HB))</name>
        <text>Your knowledge of how to change creatures into mundane objects and the basic natural forms of animals is cemented in your mind. You add the polymorph spell to your spellbook if you don't already have it, and you always have it prepared. This does not count against the number of spells you can prepare at once.
	When you cast polymorph, you can transform the target creature into an object instead of a beast. This object counts as magical and must be no more than one size larger than the creature. Any attempt to undo the existence of the item without reducing its hit points, such as by the disintegration spell or by using it as a consumed material component for a spell, makes the effect fail and immediately ends the polymorph effect, as if the creature-object had been reduced to 0 hit points.
	You can also target a nonmagical object with this spell to turn it into another object or into a beast of the same size with a challenge rating equal to or less than the level of the spell slot used.
