        <name>Bard College: College of the Requiem (HB)</name>
        <text>Bards of the College of the Requiem, often called lamenters, eulogists, or requiem singers, regardless of whether or not their requiem involves any singing, dedicate themselves to all things pertaining to death. This branches out into several different paths as some prefer funerary rites, while others keep the unnatural undead at bay. Other requiem singers still, have been known to turn this power to the bolstering of undeath, and as such, you can even see requiem singers in the armies of evil rulers that rely on the dead to bolster their ranks.
	Bards of this college are a varied bunch, turning their talents to the requiem of the dead for different reasons. In Eberron, a requiem singer could be found amongst the ranks of Karrnath's death knights and skeleton soldiers. While a requiem singer could just as easily be found in Thrane, trying to hold off the undead of Karrnath.
	In Faerun, requiem singers that bolster undead are not uncommon in Thay amongst those that wish to serve but choose not to become true Thayan wizards.
	And organizations like the Harpers always could use more requiem singers to keep the hordes of undead away from civilized lands.
	In Theros, bards of this college might be tasked with keeping the returned from running amok in the various city-states, while a group of returned could in turn be led by a particularly charismatic returned who is themself a requiem singer.
	In Ravnica, city of guilds, the guild most likely to have a member turn to this particularly niche style of music is the Rakdos. Music has long been a part of the demonic carnarium and leading the dead in a song and dance like grim puppets suits the sense of humor of the Rakdos quite well. However, the Golgari and Orzhov guilds wouldn't be too far a stretch for one of this college as well.

        <text>Spells cast by you can affect the undead as though they weren't undead. Additionally, when a creature uses bardic inspiration granted by you, if they are undead or are using it against an undead creature, they can roll the inspiration die twice and keep the higher result.

        <name>Moment of Silence (College of the Requiem (HB))</name>
        <text>When a creature within 60 feet of you is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to cast the silence spell with a radius of 60 feet, centered on the creature, which will last until the start of your next turn. The silence lasts for one minute, still requires concentration, and you can end it early as a bonus action. Once you have used this feature, you may not do so again until you finish a long rest.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Rest in Peace (College of the Requiem (HB))</name>
        <text>When you use your Song of Rest feature during a short rest, you can create a magical barrier to protect you and your allies for the duration of the short rest. Undead creatures cannot willingly come within 60 feet of you by nonmagical means, unless you permit them to do so. If an undead creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. Undead that are already within 60 feet of you when you use this feature are immune to this effect. Once you have used this feature, you may not do so again until you finish a long rest. Additionally, when undead creatures would regain hit points from your song of rest feature, they can also gain temporary hit points equal to the amount of hit points gained.
