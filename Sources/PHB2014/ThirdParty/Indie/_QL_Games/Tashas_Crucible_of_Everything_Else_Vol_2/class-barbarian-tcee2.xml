        <text>Within the depths of the Astral Plane are the githyanki, psions who manifest their intellect and force of will to shape reality around them. Barbarians who follow the Path of the Cosmic Juggernaut manifest similar power. When they enter a rage, they enter an intensely focused state, channeling psychic energy and draw upon the Astral Plane to bend time and space itself.
	The power of a Cosmic Juggernaut can physically manifest itself in different ways. At your option, you can pick from or roll on the Cosmic Juggernaut Barbarian Quirks table to create a quirk for your character.

Cosmic Juggernaut Barbarian Quirks:
d6 | Quirk
1 | Your hair and clothing flow upwards or sideways instead of down.
2 | You move unnaturally fast or slow when performing menial tasks.
3 | Tiny objects near you sometimes start to float a few inches into the air.
4 | You like to snack on small rocks and minerals.
5 | You frequently find metallic objects loosely stuck to your body.
6 | Your legs' motions don't always line up with how far you move.

        <name>Psionic Shunt (Path of the Cosmic Juggernaut (HB))</name>
        <text>You can bend space and move matter to manipulate your surroundings. As a bonus action, you can move a Large or smaller creature or object that isn't being worn or carried. The target must be within 30 feet of you and you can move it up to 10 feet in any horizontal direction. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw to avoid being moved (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). When you reach 10th level, the distance increases to 20 feet.
	If the target strikes something during this movement, the target and what it strikes each take 1d6 bludgeoning damage. If the target strikes a creature, the creature can make a Dexterity saving throw against the same DC to avoid this damage. When you reach 10th level, the damage increases to 2d6.

        <text>You can transmute the terrain around you as you move to ease your passage. Moving through difficult terrain costs you no extra movement.
	Moreover, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move. While raging, you can remain standing on the surface or liquid, rather than falling at the end of your move.

Each creature within 10 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier) or be lifted 5 feet upwards and become stunned and suspended in the air until the end of your next turn. You can use this feature only once per rage, and your rage doesn't end early if you end a turn during which you use this feature.

    <!-- Primal Path: Path of the Dragonheart (HB) -->
    <autolevel level="3">
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Primal Path: Path of the Dragonheart (HB)</name>
        <text>Tales whispered around campfires speak of fearsome warriors with the strength of dragons burning in their veins. There are few who walk the Path of the Drag onheart, for it is one of unparalleled presence on the battlefield. A unique bond forged with dragonkind fuels each dragonheart's rage, endowing these warriors with increased stamina and fortitude, as well as the ability to channel destructive energy through their weapons. The most stalwart dragonhearts even learn to share aspects of their bond with others.
	The exact nature of these barbarians is shrouded in mystery. Some sources say that these men and women gain their abilities by slaying a dragon and eating its heart. Others claim that a dragon can share its strength with a worthy soul through a deep, spiritual bond. Still, more argue that the heart of a dragon literally beats in the chest of the warrior who follows this path.
	At your option, you can pick from or roll on the Becoming a Dragonheart table to determine the nature of your character's bond.

Becoming a Dragonheart:
d6 I became a dragonheart because...
1 | I was fatally wounded, but for some reason, a dragon took mercy on me and saved my life.
2 | The rite to become a dragonheart has been passed down in my tribe for centuries.
3 | Knowing the power it would bring, I killed a helpless dragon and took its heart.
4 | I saved a dragon's eggs and it blessed me for my deeds.
5 | Seeking to have a greater influence in the world, a dragon chose me as its proxy.
6 | I made a deal with a dragon, promising to fulfill a special task in exchange for its power.

        <text>Choose the type of dragon that granted you the power of a dragonheart, from the options in the Bonded Dragon Type table.
	Whenever you take damage of the type associated with your bonded dragon, that damage is reduced by your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). Additionally, you gain the ability to speak, read, and write Draconic.

Bonded Dragon Type:
Bonded Dragon | Damage Type
Black or Copper | Acid
Blue or Bronze | Lightning
Brass, Gold, or Red | Fire
Green | Poison
Shadow | Necrotic
Silver or White | Cold

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Dragon Rage (Path of the Dragonheart (HB))</name>
        <text>Your bond grants you supernatural vitality. Whenever you enter a rage, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) that last until your rage ends.
	Furthermore, whenever you make a melee weapon attack while raging, you can channel your bond's power through your weapon. All damage dealt by the attack becomes damage of the type associated with your Dragon Bond. If the attack hits, each enemy within 5 feet of the target, other than the target, takes 1d4 damage of that same type.
	When you reach 10th level in this class, the number of temporary hit points increases to twice your Constitution modifier (minimum of 2), and the damage to nearby enemies increases to 2d4.

        <name>Soul Bond (Path of the Dragonheart (HB))</name>
        <text>You learn a ritual that allows you to share part of your dragon bond with another creature. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The creature must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the creature and forge the bond. This bond lasts until you end it with an action, or until you use this feature to create a bond with a different creature.
	While bonded to a creature and on the same plane of existence as it, you and the creature can telepathically communicate simple ideas and emotions with each other, and you always know the creature's direction and distance from you. Moreover, whenever you gain temporary hit points from your Dragon Rage, you can grant the bonded creature the same number of temporary hit points, which last until your rage ends.
	Finally, while you're raging, your rage doesn't end early if the bonded creature has attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then.

	Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

        <name>Primal Path: Path of the Horned King (HB)</name>
        <text>Since ancient days, men have gathered to honor the gods of the hunt—but every so often, one of these cults is truly devoted to Baphomet, the Horned King, the father of minotaurs. Those that knowingly and willingly beseech the demon prince's favor are endowed with ebon horns and a violent temper, making them little more than beasts hiding beneath a man's flesh.

        <name>Ebon Horns (Path of the Horned King (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, when you choose this primal path, you undergo an abominable transformation as part of the ritual of the Horned King. From your skull grows a pair of black horns, allowing you to use them as unarmed strikes and melee weapon attacks. When you hit a target with your horns, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d10 + your Strength modifier. When you reach 10th level in this class, this damage die increases to 1d12.
	If you already have horns as part of your race, you can choose whether to use the statistics of your race's horns or the horns provided by this subclass.

	Additionally, whenever you move at least 20 feet in a straight line toward a target and hit it with your horns on the same turn, the target takes additional damage equal to your Strength modifier.

        <text>Those that devote themselves to the Horned King or give into his rituals become beasts among men—and no true predator ever gets lost. Starting at 6th level, you can perfectly recall any path you have traveled.
	Additionally, you can psychically track prey. As an action, you can designate one creature you can see as your prey. For the next 10 minutes, you can use another action to learn the current distance and direction to the target if it is on the same plane of existence (but not necessarily the shortest or safest route). You must concentrate to maintain this connection, as if concentrating on a spell. You can only have one designated prey creature at a time.

        <name>Baleful Bull Rush (Path of the Horned King (HB))</name>
        <text>When you charge forward, it is with the malice of the Horned King himself, allowing you to slip through planes of existence in a burst of speed.
	At 14th level, when you take the Dash action while raging and can see your prey (as per the Beast of the Labyrinth feature), you enter the Border Ethereal until you've reached your target, stopped moving toward your target, or have used all of your movement speed.
	While on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and hear the plane you originated from, which is cast in shades of gray. You can't see anything more than 60 feet into that plane, and you can only affect and be affected by other creatures on the Ethereal Plane. Creatures that aren't there can't perceive you or interact with you, unless they have the ability to do so.
	If you emerge from the Ethereal Plane within 10 feet of your quarry after using this feature, your attacks against the creature on this turn deal an additional 1d12 damage.
