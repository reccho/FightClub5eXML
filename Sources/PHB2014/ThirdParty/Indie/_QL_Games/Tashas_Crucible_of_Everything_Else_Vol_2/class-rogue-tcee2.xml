        <name>Roguish Archetype: Wayfinder (HB)</name>
        <text>You connect yourself with nature, enhancing your mobility and prowess with primal magic. Often found alongside druids, rangers, and other protectors of the wild, Wayfinders traverse the land to preserve the balance between nature and civilization.
	On Ravnica, those who follow this archetype often join the Selesnya Conclave, granting them access to the power of the Worldsoulâ€”a vast collected consciousness of wisdom and experience. In the Forgotten Realms, you might obtain your magic from a deity of nature, such as Melora or Mielikki. On other worlds, your ability to cast spells might come from a connection with a great nature spirit.
	Perhaps more than any other rogue, you understand the importance of community and working as one. You are skilled at leading the way and using the terrain to your group's advantage. This is true whether you are guiding allies through an overgrown forest, rubble of a destroyed city block, or people on a crowded street.

        <name>Spellcasting (Wayfinder (HB))</name>
        <text>You learn to tap into the power of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 of the Basic Rules or the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spell- casting and chapter 11 for the druid spell list.

Cantrips:
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn an additional druid cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

Spell Slots:
The Wayfinder Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of them, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell entangle and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast entangle using either slot.

Preparing Spells:
You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your rogue level divided by 3, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
	You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation:
at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

Spellcasting Ability:
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

        <name>Lead the Way (Wayfinder (HB))</name>
        <text>You gain proficiency with either cartographer's tools or navigator's tools (your choice).
	Additionally, whenever you succeed on a Strength-, Dexterity-, or Wisdom-based skill check, friendly creatures that can see or hear when you make the check learn from your prowess. Each of those creatures has advantage on the first ability check it makes to attempt the same task within the next 10 minutes.

        <name>Terrain Mastery (Wayfinder (HB))</name>
        <text>You've learned to magically manipulate the terrain itself. Any enemy that is in difficult terrain when you start your turn has disadvantage on the first saving throw it makes against a spell you cast during that turn.
	Moreover, moving through difficult terrain created by your spells doesn't cost you or your allies extra movement.

        <name>Wild Sense (Wayfinder (HB))</name>
        <text>You're always ready for when an enemy strikes and can magically grant others that same awareness. You can't be surprised while you are conscious. Whenever a creature you can see or hear within 60 feet of you is surprised, you can use your reaction to cause that creature to be no longer surprised.

        <name>Nature's Fury (Wayfinder (HB))</name>
        <text>You press your advantage against foes with unsteady positioning. Whenever you make an attack against a creature that is in difficult terrain, you score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.
	Additionally, whenever you damage a hostile creature with your Sneak Attack, allies that can see you learn from your approach. The next attack roll one of those allies makes against the creature before the start of your next turn is made with advantage.
