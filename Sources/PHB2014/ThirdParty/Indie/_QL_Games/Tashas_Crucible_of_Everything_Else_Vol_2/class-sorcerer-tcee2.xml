        <name>Sorcerous Origin: Bestial Spirit (HB)</name>
        <text>Power drawn from the great Beastlands or another plane of great beasital power has been passed down your lineage since an ancestor made a deal with a great animal god, or perhaps spent an amount of time within the great library. Either way, a powerful bestial spirit resides within you. Occasionally appearing as cat-like eyes, higher reflexes, excessive hair growth, or sharpened nails and teeth, this spirit brings about a new commune with nature and the animals that reside within.

3rd | animal messenger, beast sense

        <name>Animal Instinct (Bestial Spirit (HB))</name>
        <text>As your eyes sharpen and your mindset shifts you become innately more in tune with the world around you. You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.
	In addition, choose one of the following skills: Perception, Stealth, or Survival. You gain proficiency with that skill and with Animal Handling. As a result of the primal magic in your veins, whenever you make a check using either of these two skills, you gain a bonus to the check equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).

You gain a climbing and a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, you can climb difficult surfaces (including upside down on ceilings) without needing to make an ability check, and you can breathe water as well as air.

        <name>Fury of the Pack (Bestial Spirit (HB))</name>
        <text>As an action, you can spend up to 10 sorcery points and summon celestial spirits that take the form of beasts or swarms of beasts and appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within 120 feet. The summoned spirits can have a combined challenge rating equal to or lower than the sorcery points spent. For example, if you spend 5 sorcery points, you could summon one CR 5 beast, or two CR 2 beasts and one CR 1 beast, or some other combination. Any beast or swarm of beasts with a challenge rating lower than 1 costs 1 sorcery point to summon.
	A beast or swarm of beasts conjured in this way is considered celestial, appears slightly transparent, and disappears after 1 minute or when it drops to 0 hit points. You can also dismiss any number of creatures summoned in this way as an action. The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions.

    <autolevel level="1">
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Sorcerous Origin: Rakshasa Bloodline (HB)</name>
        <text>Your innate magic comes from the meddling of a devious rakshasa, a manipulative and tiger-like fiend that uses illusions and enchantments to torment its prey. One of the devilish creatures might have claimed you as a prize after scheming against your family, then imbued you with power for its own nefarious ends; maybe somewhere in your ancestry, a rakshasa took on the guise of a family member long enough to taint your line; or perhaps one of your ancestors slew a rakshasa and was cursed to bear children that resemble the infernal monster. However they came to be, the raksha- sa's powers of misdirection and manipulation course through your veins.
	The rakshasa bloodline can physically manifest itself in different ways. At your option, you can pick from or roll on the Rakshasa Sorcerer Quirks table to create a quirk for your character.

Rakshasa Bloodline Quirks:
d6 | Quirks
1 | Your hands are backwards, with palms where the backs of your hands would normally be.
2 | You have tiger-like stripes that stretch across your skin or hair.
3 | You have gleaming, cat-like eyes that reflect light in the dark.
4 | You have a habit of growling when angered and purring when content.
5 | When someone states an obvious fact, you feel compelled to convince them otherwise.
6 | Your ears, hair, nose, or some other facial feature has a different look every day.

        <text>You know the disguise self spell, but it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you can know.
	Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the spell without expending a spell slot by spending 1 sorcery point.

        <name>Spell Immpunity (Rakshasa Bloodline (HB))</name>
        <text>You manifest part of the limited magic immunity that a rakshasa possesses. Whenever you are subject to a spell and you can see or hear the caster, you learn the spell's level. You can then immediately use your reaction to spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level (or 1 point for a cantrip) and become immune to that casting of the spell. The highest level of a spell you can become immune to using this feature equals your sorcerer level divided by 3, rounded down.

        <text>You can infest the dreams of others to influence their actions when they awaken. You learn the dream spell. It is a sorcerer spell for you but doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.
	If you select yourself as the messenger, you can spend 2 sorcery points once before the spell ends to cast the suggestion spell on the target. The target is considered within sight and range when you cast the suggestion spell in this way, regardless of its actual distance from you.
