        <text>Gods of the cold and north, such as Auril, Iborighu, Thrym, and Ulutiu, are, like their element, often severe and demanding. These gods are not usually worshipped for their benevolence, but instead prey upon those who merely wish to survive the unforgiving tundra. Clerics to these gods may not be the warmest people, but they are often seen as saviors to northern settlements that rely on their blessings. These boons are not free though, and clerics of these gods may be sent to gather offerings in return for helping people survive.

Domain Spells:
At each indicated cleric level, add the listed spells to your spells prepared. They do not count towards your limit.

        <name>Biting Frost (Frost Domain (HB))</name>
        <text>When you deal cold damage with a spell of 1st level or higher, you may apply one of the following additional effects to the spell:

	• Your enemies' limbs go numb. Creatures that take damage from this spell have disadvantage on the next weapon attack roll they make before the end of the next turn.

	• Your enemies begin to freeze in place. Creatures that take damage from this spell have their speed halved until the end of their next turn.

	• Your enemies' teeth chatter incessantly. Creatures that take damage from this spell must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be unable to perform verbal components of spells until the end of their next turn.

	• Your spell's temperature sinks even lower, a deep freeze dangerous even for beings acclimated to the cold. Creatures that take damage from this spell cannot benefit from resistance to cold damage from this casting of this spell.

        <text>Your affinity with frost has reached its peak. You gain immunity to cold damage and resistance to fire damage, and moving through difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost you extra movement.
