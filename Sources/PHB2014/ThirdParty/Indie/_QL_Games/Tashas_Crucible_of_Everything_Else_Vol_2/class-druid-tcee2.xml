        <text>Druids are known amongst the masses for their secret groups, sacred locales, and sacramental rites. None fit this description more so than the druids that gather together in the spirit of cult sorority, where the whole is exponentially more powerful than the mere sum of its parts which parts often consist of hags and other unseelie fey. These mystical magicians, while not known for infant-snatching like their namesake, do give more attention to the civilized world than the rest of their kind. Their skill with the cauldron, and their ability to take the form of humanoids in addition to beasts, allow them to closely observe and even infiltrate communities of all kinds. While the intentions of these druids are frequently debated amongst those who are familiar with them, their power is not.

        <name>Double, Double (Circle of the Coven (HB))</name>
        <text>As an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape to magically polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid. Your statistics are the same in this form, and your equipment magically resizes to fit your new form. You can remain in this form for a number of hours equal to half your druid level rounded down (minimum of 1 hour) and can end it early as an action. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 4 times your druid level, and you revert to your normal form early if you lose all of these temporary hit points. All other standard Wild Shape rules still apply while you are transformed in this way.
	While you are transformed using your Wild Shape feature, whether into a beast or humanoid form, you gain a special action. While in your Wild Shape, you can use your action to briefly adopt a ghastly appearance, forcing all creatures within 30 feet that can see you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened of you for 1 minute. It can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
	If you model your appearance after a specific humanoid, a suspicious creature can make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC, realizing that you are an imposter on a success.

        <name>Circle Spells (Circle of the Coven (HB))</name>
        <text>You have learned the secret magics of hags, granting you access to certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the minor illusion cantrip, and it doesn't count against the number of druid cantrips you know. You also learn the hex spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.
	When you reach certain levels in this class, you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of the Coven Spells table. Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

        <text>While you are in a humanoid Wild Shape, you can use your action to magically turn invisible until you attack, cast a spell, or until your humanoid Wild Shape ends. While invisible, you must concentrate as if you were concentrating on a spell, you leave no footprints, and any equipment that you chose to (or chose not to) alter to fit a humanoid Wild Shape is also invisible.

        <text>When you are in a humanoid Wild Shape, your Strength score becomes 20 and you can make natural weapon attacks with either claws or a bite. These attacks deal 2d8 + your Strength modifier in either slashing damage (for claws) or piercing damage (for bite). The attacks are considered magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity.
	Additionally, while in a humanoid Wild Shape, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons that aren't silvered.

        <text>When you are wielding a trident or spear and a creature within 5 feet of you makes an attack against you, you can use your reaction to make a special melee attack against the creature. On a hit, instead of dealing damage you move 5 feet without provoking opportunity attacks, potentially causing the attack to miss if you move out of range.
