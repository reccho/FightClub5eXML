        <text>You follow patterns set by will-o'-wisps, departed souls that feed on fear and despair. Good Bog Phantoms often serve as guides in swamps or other dangerous areas. Evil ones may copy the behaviors of their power's inspiration, and enjoy luring unsuspecting wanderers to their deaths.

        <text>By 7th level, you have learned to briefly adopt a spectral form. As an action, you can turn yourself and your equipment incorporeal for 1 minute, or until you dismiss the effect as an action. While in this state, you have the following features:

	• You cannot make weapon attacks.

	• You have a flying speed of 50 feet.

	• You can pass through objects and creatures as if they were difficult terrain. If you end your turn inside an object or creature, you take 5 (1d10) force damage.

	• You have resistance to all damage except force damage.

	• Even when you are in plain sight, it takes a successful Wisdom (Perception) check to spot you if you have neither moved nor attacked. A creature that tries to enter your space while unaware of you is surprised by you. The DC for this check is equal to your spell save DC.

Once you have used this feature, you may not do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
