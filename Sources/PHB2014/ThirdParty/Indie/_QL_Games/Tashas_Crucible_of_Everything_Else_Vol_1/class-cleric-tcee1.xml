        <text>Most clerics are pillars of their community, overseeing worship, healing, and religious rites in their god's name. However, all faiths have rules, acts which are seen as taboo and creatures declared anathema. When violations appear, the inquisitors follow, finding the violators and enforcing the law with divine wrath and the point of a sword.
	Inquisitors bring safety to some, but are often fearsome figures in their work. At their best, they protect their communities from corrupting influences of cults, undead, and creatures from the outer planes. At their worst, they are tyrants, leading reigns of terror to quash dissent and oppress those who do not share their faiths.
	Inquisitors exist throughout the multiverse, serving causes both good and evil. On many planes, the church of Lolth makes extensive use of them to root out dissent among the drow, and inquisitors of Bahamut are tasked with finding and quashing cults in service of Tiamat. In Faerun, Helm's eternal quest to protect his servants draws many inquisitors, and the efforts of Bane's followers to establish dominion over regions they control encourages many onto the path of the inquisitor as well. In Eberron, Thrane's Church of the Silver Flame and the secret police of Zilargo include many inquisitors among their ranks. Inquisitors abound among the clerics of Ravenloft, given the predominance of malign entities to be fought, corrupt cults to be stopped, and overbearing tyrants to be served.

As a bonus action on your first turn of combat you can present your holy symbol and invoke the name of your deity. All hostile creatures within 30 feet of you who can see you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened by you until the end of your next turn. A creature frightened in this way has a speed of 0. Creatures who are surprised when you use this ability have disadvantage on this saving throw.

Frightened:
	• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
	• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.

    <autolevel level="1">
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Divine Domain: Seership Domain (HB)</name>
        <text>Seers are those touched by gods or other powerful entities in order to help guide others. Rather than being the one to smite those who their patron considers "evil" or "unjust", Seers help influence events and people in order to gain a favored outcome. While altering Fate is incredibly beneficial, it sometimes comes at a price.
	The eyes of a Seer can view the threads of magic that weave between creatures and places. They are often wise beyond their intelligence as their patron nudges them forward like the guiding hands of fortune.
	Seers are perfect for players who want to have more of a support role, using premonitions in order to aid their allies in battle. These clerics could be randomly chosen by gods who deem them vital to history and fate, or simply fortune tellers whose fortunes were heard by powerful ears.

Domain Spells:
At each indicated cleric level, add the listed spells to your spells prepared. They do not count towards your limit.

Seership Domain Spells:
Cleric Level | Spells
1th | detect magic, identify
3th | locate object, phantasmal force
5th | clairvoyance, dispel magic
7th | hallucinatory terrain, locate creature
9th | legend lore, scrying

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Divine Domain: Trade Domain (HB)</name>
        <text>The Trade Domain focuses on the acquisition of wealth, the safeguarding of items and the negotiation of deals and bargains. In many civilizations, the power and influence of coin is said to rival that of the gods themselves. The gods of trade often promote the betterment of the self through financial success, as well as its benefits to society as a whole — though some are more focused on its more selfish applications. Clerics of this domain often travel as merchants, offering their divine services in each town they visit. Others take a more mercenary path, willing to venture into dangerous places for the right price.
	Deities of all alignments can claim influence over this domain, particularly deities of commerce and bargains (such as Tymora, Waukeen, and Vergadain), and gods of greed (such as Abbathor and Tiamat).

While your holy symbol is in your hand, you can expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to double your proficiency bonus for any ability check you make that uses those skills for 1 minute.
	In addition, you learn the friends cantrip, which doesn't count against the number of cleric cantrips you know.

        <name>Channel Divinity: Instant Transaction (Trade Domain (HB))</name>
        <text>You can use your Channel Divinity to cause a creature to partake in a magical and instantaneous trade.
	As an action, you present a coin, used as your holy symbol, to a creature you can see within 30 feet. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or else one nonmagical object it is holding that weighs less than 10 pounds is forcibly pulled towards you and comes to a rest in your empty hand (provided you are able to hold it) or at your feet. The coin you presented is magically teleported to the ground in the creature's space.
	At the start of its next turn, the creature becomes aware of what has occurred and might take measures to retrieve the item. Once you have successfully used this on a creature, you can't use this on that same creature again until you finish a long rest.

        <text>You gain the ability to magically entice your foes, momentarily reducing their commitment to an attack. When a creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll against you or an ally, you can use your reaction to present a coin, used as your holy symbol, and impose a -10 penalty on the roll, using your Channel Divinity. You can make this choice after you see the roll, but before you know whether the attack hits or misses.

        <name>Buy Loyalty (Trade Domain (HB))</name>
        <text>You gain the ability to magically broker a deal with your enemies. As an action, you can present your holy symbol to force a creature within 60 feet of you that can hear and understand you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this feature. On a failed save, you learn of an object the target desires most and enter into a magical bargain with it, promising to fulfill its desires within a day. If the creature desires no object, it instead specifies an amount of gold or a task it wishes to be completed.
	For the next 24 hours, the creature is charmed by you. While charmed in this manner, the creature is friendly to you and your allies and will fight on your behalf, including turning against its former allies (though this may require a significantly larger, more costly reward). The creature will act in your best interests and follow your spoken commands, but won't take part in an activity that would lead to certain death.
	If you provide the creature with its desire at the end of the 24 hours, the effect ends and the creature is indifferent towards you. The creature immediately turns hostile if you fail to provide the promised reward, or if you or your allies harm it while it is charmed. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
