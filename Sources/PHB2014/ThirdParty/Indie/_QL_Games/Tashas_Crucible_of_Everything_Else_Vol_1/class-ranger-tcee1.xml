        <name>Ranger Archetype: Dark Trapper (HB)</name>
        <text>Blood magic is often banned for a reason. Dark Trappers tap into the primordial magic that binds creatures to the world they live in. You have learned the shape of reality, and can use it to force creatures to stay in a location, send pulsing waves of damage through their blood, and harness the energy your prey provides to keep yourself alive longer.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Dark Tether (Dark Trapper (HB))</name>
        <text>You can temporarily restrict the movement of your prey. As an action, you can choose one point you can see within 60 feet of you. Choose a number of creatures up to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one) within 10 feet of that point. Each of these creatures must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or else be tethered to that point.
	While tethered in this way, the creature can't move further from that point in any direction, although it can move closer. These tethers last for 1 minute or until you dismiss them as a bonus action. A tethered creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
	While a creature is tethered, it takes 1d4 psychic damage at the beginning of each of its turns, and it can't take reactions. If the creature dies, its tether vanishes.
	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

        <text>You can use your tethers to inflict more injury on your quarry. You have advantage on attack rolls against creatures in your dark tethers. When you hit a tethered creature with a weapon attack, that creature takes an extra 1d8 psychic damage. You can deal this extra damage only once each turn.

        <text>You gain the ability to spread damage even outside of your tethers. Once per turn, when you hit a creature that is within 5 feet of another creature with a weapon attack, you can choose to force the second creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the second creature takes half the damage you dealt to the first creature.

        <name>Ranger Archetype: Herbalist (HB)</name>
        <text>Herbalists are true masters of their environment, able to find and utilise the rare and often magical components hidden in the undergrowth. Using these skills, they can create wondrous tonics, salves, potions and balms that can provide themselves and their allies with temporary beneficial effects. These rangers are often considered to be healers and witch-doctors instead of warriors, but there is no doubt that their abilities can turn the tide of battle.

        <name>Create Concoction (Herbalist (HB))</name>
        <text>As part of a long rest, you are able to create a number of salves and tinctures using your herbalism kit and materials you have collected during your travels (including medicinal herbs, roots and animal glands). When you finish a long rest, you can prepare a number of concoctions equal to 2 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 3) chosen from the Salves and Tinctures list below. Each concoction provides a single dose, which is consumed upon use.
	If you are in one of your favoured terrains, you may produce one additional concoction as you are able to easily find extra ingredients.
	All concoctions lose their potency after 24 hours.

        <text>Burning Beeswax. This caustic beeswax must be carefully handled. As an action, the wax can be applied to a weapon or piece of ammunition. For the next minute, a hit with the weapon or ammunition deals an additional 2d4 acid damage.

Death Bell. A foul tasting tonic that is said prevents the dying from slipping into death. A creature can ingest the tonic as a bonus action to gain advantage on death saving throws for 8 hours.

Displacer Herb. This rare herb seems to forever shift and shiver in the hand. A creature can consume the herb as a bonus action. Until the start of its next turn, the creature does not provoke opportunity attacks as its form becomes difficult to focus upon.

Elfroot Granola. This recipe of simple nuts, fruit and nearby vegetation lightens the spirit and relieves tension. A creature that spends 1 minute consuming the food gains temporary hit points equal to 1d8 plus your wisdom modifier.

Gnomeberry Juice. This iron-tasting extract from a rare fruit can temporarily shrink you in size. As a bonus action, a creature can consume the liquid to gain the "reduce" effects of an enlarge/reduce spell for 10 minutes.

Hastening Sap. This golden liquid is said to be sap from the trees of the Feywild, though it can be found on trees near portals to that realm. A creature can ingest it as a bonus action to gain an increase of 15 feet to their speed for the next minute.

Hollowbone Tonic. Torn feathers float in this blueish liquid. A creature can consume the tonic as a bonus action, granting it resistance to falling damage and preventing any damage for falls of less than 30 feet for 8 hours.

Night Eye Berries. These dark berries can allow temporary vision in the darkest of locations. As an action, a creature can squeeze the juice from these berries into its eyes to gain darkvision for 1 hour. If a creature already has darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.

Poison-Purge Potion. This vial of carefully distilled poison from local creatures and plants can forcibly remove toxins from the body. A creature can drink the potion as a bonus action to end the poisoned condition.

Pond Leaf. This dried and twisted leaf reeks of pond water. A creature that chews on this leaf for 1 minute can breathe water and gains a swimming speed equal to its walking speed for 8 hours.

Potent Musk. This mixture of animal glands can be used to calm a wild beast. A creature can apply the musk to their hands and clothing as an action, granting them advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks for 1 hour.

Shadow Rose Pollen. This aromatic flower is known to calm the nerves and improve concentration. A creature can consume the pollen as an action to gain advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks for 1 hour.

Slipstone Oil. This clear and slimy oil is difficult to procure and contain. A creature can spend 1 minute applying the oil to their person to gain advantage on saving throws against effects that would leave them grappled or restrained.

Stinging Spores. These delicate spores can explode into tiny airborne barbs when struck. A creature can spend one minute applying them to a cloak or armor of a creature. The next time the creature is hit by a melee attack, the attacker takes 2d6 piercing damage.

        <text>At 11th level, you have learned to use your magic to infuse your creations with elemental energy. As an action, and with your herbalism kit in hand, you can spend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to apply a defensive balm to a creature within 5 feet of you. The creature gains resistance to your choice of one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison or thunder. This resistance lasts for 1 hour.
	A creature under this effect can choose to end the resistance as an action, making a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of it, using your spell attack bonus. This attack deals a number of d8s equal to the spell slot used, of the relevant damage type.

        <text>Staring up at the night sky, one's thoughts may drift to the vast unknown of the cosmos; an infinitely expansive sea of darkness speckled with inconceivably hot stars and unforgivingly harsh planets. While the starry heavens might seem absolutely foreign and unknowable, the Stargazer finds comfort and guidance from them. They learn more about their current location by looking at the constellations than they would from seeing a map.

        <text>You gain proficiency with cartographer's tools and navigator's tools. While you have a clear vision of any cosmic bodies (such as stars, moons, or planets), you always know your location in the Material Plane and what time of year it is. This feature does not work if you are not on the planet or plane of your origin, though you can spend 8 hours studying the night sky to reorient yourself on new planets or planes in this way.
	Further, you have advantage on saving throws against being blinded, and dim light does not impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks.

	At 11th level, the additional radiant damage increases to 2d6.

Any creatures within that sphere that can see the light must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of your next turn. You can choose a number of creatures equal to your Wisdom modifier, and those creatures automatically succeed on the saving throw.
	Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest, or unless you expend a ranger spell slot of 2nd-level or higher to do so again.
