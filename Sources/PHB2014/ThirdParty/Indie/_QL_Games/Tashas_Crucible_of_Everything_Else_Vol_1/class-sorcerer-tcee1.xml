        <text>Some creatures are born with an innate connection to the Weave and can use their own bodies as a spellcasting focus. These sorcerers often find their abilities well suited to life in the wild frontier or as clandestine agents for powerful organizations.
	Any number of factors can bestow this gift upon a creature. Known spellslingers often cite events such as the following for their gifts: surviving a magical cataclysm, a blessing of a powerful fey monarch, an ancestor's bargain with an otherworldly being, or sheer dumb luck.

        <text>You have the unique ability to twist your magic in ways no other sorcerer can. These are called Slings, and many enhance or modify your spells in some way. You gain two Slings of your choice and an additional one at 14th level. When you gain Metamagic options at 10th and 17th levels, you can choose from either the Metamagic list or "Sorcerer (Spellslinger (HB)): Sling" list.
	You can use only one Sling or Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.

        <name>Sorcerous Origin: Wild Magic Remastered (HB)</name>
        <text>One of the most common complaints about the Wild Magic sorcerer is that it has an excellent narrative, but much weaker mechanics than its counterparts, and that its relies heavily on having a highly skilled Dungeon Master. That's a lot of pressure for a DM! This remastered version aims to ameliorate these problems in the following ways:

	• Rephrase the Wild Magic Surge feature as a Wild Magic Trigger feature to reduce confusion about when you should roll 1d20 or 1d100.

	• Restructure the Wild Magic Surge and Tides of Chaos features so they don't have to rely so heavily on the Dungeon Master. Now you always have a 5% chance of a spell going wildly out of control, not a 5% chance only at the DM's discretion. After you've used your Tides of Chaos feature, this chance increases to 10%, but the DM can still indicate your magic goes wildly out of control anyways.

	• Increase the power of the Bend Luck feature to be more comparable to the Divine Soul sorcerer's Favored By The Gods feature and bards' Bardic Inspiration feature.

	• Other minor balance adjustments to further pursue the 'risk vs. reward' narrative and design philosophy.

        <name>Wild Magic Trigger (Wild Magic Remastered (HB))</name>
        <text>Your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Each time you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, roll a d20 immediately after. This is called a Wild Magic Trigger roll. If you roll a 1 on the die, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table (1d100) to create a magical effect. If the effect is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic, and if it normally requires concentration, it doesn't require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.

Wild Magic Surge:
d100 | Effect
01-02 | Roll on this table at the start of each of your turns for the next minute, ignoring this result on subsequent rolls.
03-04 | For the next minute, you can see any invisible creature if you have line of sight to it.
05-06 | A modron chosen and controlled by the DM appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, then disappears 1 minute later.
07-08 | You cast fireball as a 3rd-level spell centered on yourself.

21-22 | Creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against the next spell you cast in the next minute that involves a saving throw.
23-24 | Your skin turns a vibrant shade of blue. A remove curse spell can end this effect.

39-40 | You regain 2d10 hit points.

53-54 | You are immune to being intoxicated by alcohol for the next 5d6 days.
55-56 | Your hair falls out but grows back within 24 hours.
57-58 | For the next minute, any flammable object you touch that isn't being worn or carried by another creature bursts into flame.
