    <text>You test the confidence of a group of creatures before the gods by conjuring a vision of the upper planes. Each creature in a 40-foot cone in a direction you choose must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 radiant damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn by the incomprehensible glories that it sees. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't stunned.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the size of the cone increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 4th.

    <text>You quickly replicate a ball bearing at a high velocity in a 15-foot cone. Each creature within the cone must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 piercing damage. This damage ignores swarms' resistance to piercing damage. The replicated ball bearings disappear immediately after the spell.

Cantrip Upgrade: This spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

    <text>You begin to merge your current plane of existence with a plane of elemental air in a 30-foot-radius, 60-foot-tall cylinder centered on a point that you can see within range. For the duration of the spell, all creatures gain a flying speed of 30 feet while inside the cylinder. A creature that is still in flight when the spell ends floats safely to the ground, as if by the feather fall spell.
	When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the duration, you can cause one of the following effects:

	• The cylinder fills with magical silence. No sound can be created within or pass through the cylinder. Any creature or object entirely inside the cylinder is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Performing verbal components of spells is impossible within the cylinder. This silence lasts until the spell ends, you dispel it as a bonus action, or you fill the cylinder with magical amplification.

	• The cylinder fills with magical amplification. Creatures within the cylinder make saving throws against effects that deal thunder damage with disadvantage, and nonmagical objects and structures become vulnerable to thunder damage while inside. Spells that can normally only target creatures can also target nonmagical objects and structures within the cylinder. This amplification lasts until the spell ends, you dispel it as a bonus action, or until you fill the cylinder with magical silence.

	• You compress the air in the cylinder. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.

	• Whenever a spell originates in the cylinder, there is a 25 percent chance that a random effect from the Wild Magic Surge table replaces the spell's intended effect, and a 25 percent chance that one occurs immediately after the spell is cast as well. The Wild Magic Surge table can be found in Chapter 3 of the Player's Handbook, under the description of the Wild Magic Sorcerous Origin.

	• Each time a creature moves 5 feet within the cylinder, there is a 50 percent chance that it moves in a random direction instead of the intended one.

	• Creatures in the area have disadvantage on saving throws against being blinded and effects that deal radiant damage. Celestials are immune to this effect.

	• Spells cast within the cylinder that restore hit points function as if they were cast using a spell slot one level higher than the spell slot used.

	• If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of 7th level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.

When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the duration, you can target a creature in the area with one of the following effects:

	• If the creature has died within the last 10 minutes, it is restored to life with 1 hit point.
	• You end one disease affecting the creature.
	• The creature's exhaustion level reduces by 1.
	• You end one of the following conditions affecting the creature: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, poisoned, or petrified.

	When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the duration, you can cause one of the following:

	• The surface of stone, dirt, and any other earthen area within the cylinder liquifies and becomes sticky, turning into difficult terrain. A creature that starts its turn on such a surface must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or become stuck to the surface and be grappled until the start of its next turn or until the spell ends. A creature grappled in this way has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

	• Stone, dirt, and other earthen surfaces within the area buck wildly. Each creature on such a surface must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 bludgeoning damage and be moved 10 feet in a random horizontal direction within the cylinder.

This spell has no effect on structures.

    <text>You begin to merge your current plane of existence with a plane of fey and dreams in a 30-foot-radius, 60-foot-tall cylinder centered on a point that you can see within range. For the duration, all nonmagical plants and beasts in the area are given intelligence and movement, as if by an awaken spell. They lose this benefit when the spell ends or if they leave the cylinder.
	When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the duration, you can cause one of the following effects:

	• Each creature within the cylinder must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by or frightened of you (your choice when you take the action) for the duration of the spell. A creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Fey automatically succeed on this saving throw.

	• Each creature within the cylinder must succeed a Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for the duration of the spell. Attempts to wake creatures sleeping in the cylinder automatically fail. A creature who is unconscious can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to magical sleep for 24 hours. Fey are immune to this effect.

	• You summon a swarm of sprites in an unoccupied space of your choice within the cylinder. These sprites are hostile to all creatures in the area that are not Fey, and disappear when the spell ends or if they leave the cylinder.

For the duration of the spell, all creatures within the area make saving throws against effects that deal fire damage with disadvantage.
	When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the duration, you can cause one of the following effects:

	• You magically conjure 1d4 magma mephits, smoke mephits, or steam mephits (your choice) in unoccupied spaces of your choice within the cylinder. They are hostile to all creatures that are not elementals and act on their own initiative count. These mephits lack the Summon Mephits action. A mephit summoned in this way disappears when the spell ends or if it leaves the cylinder.

	• You mentally command all mephits summoned by this spell to immediately die, triggering their Death Burst traits.

	• You ignite all flammable objects within the cylinder. Creatures are also at risk of catching on fire and must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or else catch fire. A creature that is on fire or is wearing or holding something that is on fire takes 1d8 fire damage at the start of each of its turns, and can take this damage no more than once each turn. A creature can use its action to drop prone and extinguish the flames on it. Flames ignited in this way go out when the spell ends or if they leave the cylinder.

    <text>You begin to merge your current plane of existence with one of the many material planes in a 30-foot-radius, 60-foot-tall cylinder centered on a point that you can see within range.
	Whenever a spell that deals damage begins at, ends inside, passes through, or overlaps with the cylinder, you can use your reaction to attempt to neutralize the spell by making an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC for this check is equal to 10 + the level of the spell slot used to cast the spell (DC 10 for cantrips). If you succeed, the spell ends immediately and has no further effect.
	As an action on your turn, you can attempt to banish an otherworldly creature in the area. A creature of your choice within the cylinder must succeed on a Charisma saving throw, or else be teleported to its native plane. Humanoids and creatures native to your current plane of existence automatically succeed on this saving throw.

	• Any rolls that would normally use 1d20 use 2d10 instead.

	• A creature that moves within the cylinder on its turn can only move in one direction that turn and must move its full speed until it leaves the cylinder. If it can't move its full speed in that direction (for example, if it would be blocked by a wall), it can't move in that direction at all.

	• All saving throws made in the cylinder against effects that deal necrotic damage are made with advantage or disadvantage (your choice when you cast the spell).

	• When a humanoid creature dies in the cylinder, it immediately becomes a zombie under your mental control. All zombies created in this manner share your initiative count, but act immediately after you. These zombies return to mundane corpses when the spell ends or if they leave the cylinder.

When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the duration, you can cause one of the following effects:

	• Each creature in the cylinder must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be stricken with extreme lethargy. A creature that fails this saving throw wastes its next turn doing nothing. Undead and constructs are immune to this effect.

	When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the duration, you can cause one of the following effects:

	• You magically conjure 1d4 ice mephits, mud mephits, or steam mephits (your choice) in unoccupied spaces of your choice within the cylinder. They are hostile to all creatures that are not elementals and act on their own initiative count. These mephits lack the Summon Mephits action.

	• You mentally command all mephits summoned by this spell to immediately die, triggering their Death Burst traits.

	• You fill the cylinder with magical fog, as if by the fog cloud spell. This fog dissipates when the spell ends or when you dispel it as a bonus action, and can't be blown away by a strong wind.

	• You cause the water on all surfaces in the cylinder to freeze. These surfaces count as difficult terrain, and any creature that makes a Strength (Athletics) check, Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, or that takes the Dash action on an icy surface must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save the creature falls prone immediately after completing the check or action and takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage. On a successful save, nothing happens.

    <text>You toss a clockwork puppet to an unoccupied space that you can see within range. When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it, seeing the object for what it really is. To others, the decoy projects the illusion of a medium humanoid of your choice that performs a taunting dance or an intimidating gesture goading them to fight it. As a bonus action on your turn, you can mentally command the puppet and the illusion to move up to 20 feet.
	Creatures that start their turn within 10 feet of the puppet must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is compelled to move toward the decoy and make a melee weapon attack against it, believing it to be the primary threat. Attacks against the illusion harmlessly flow through the illusion and do not usually damage the puppet, though exceptions can occur. On a successful save, a creature realizes that the projected humanoid is an illusion and becomes immune to the effects of this spell for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to the charmed condition automatically succeed on this save. The effect on a creature also ends if it takes any damage.

	• Its location.
	• Its destination. (both the plane it leads to and the exact location on that plane)
	• If it requires certain circumstances or items to use, you learn what those circumstances or items are.
	• If it requires a password to use, you learn that it requires a password but do not learn the password.

    <text>You instantaneously shunt an object through the fabric of space to a willing creature with which you are familiar. The object can be no larger than 1 foot on a side and weigh no more than 10 pounds. When you cast the spell, the recipient is magically informed what the object is. If the creature is willing, the object appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the creature. The creature chooses which space it appears in. If the creature is on another plane of existence, is incapacitated, is proofed against magical detection or location, or is unwilling to receive the object, the spell fails.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the maximum dimensions increase by both 1 foot on each side and 10 pounds for each slot level above 3rd.

    <text>You perform a ritual of folk magic designed to bring the blessings of gods or spirits on those who take part.

Blessing of the Exorcism: One individual you touch who is charmed or possessed may immediately make a saving throw against that effect (as the original saving throw), ending the effect on a success. Once a creature receives this blessing, it can't do so again for 7 days.

Blessing of the Faithful: You perform a worship service with a number of creatures up to your caster level, all of whom must be within 30 feet of you for the duration of the spell. Those creatures gain advantage on their next saving throw against being charmed or frightened for the next 24 hours. Once a creature receives this blessing, it can't do so again for 7 days.

Blessing of the Feast: You partake in a feast with a number of creatures up to your caster level, all of whom must be within 30 feet for the duration of the spell. Those creatures can each roll 1d4 and add the number rolled an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes within the next 24 hours. If those creatures have spent at least 24 hours fasting (abstaining from eating, drinking or other specific behaviors as defined by your faith) before taking part in this ceremony, they can apply this blessing to one of each of those rolls within the next 24 hours. Once a creature receives this blessing, it can't do so again for 30 days.

Blessing of the Hearth: You ward a single structure, or part of a larger structure, which fits within a 50 foot cube that you are in when you cast this spell. Creatures that complete an entire long rest within the affected area at any point in the next 7 days are blessed while within the area. Whenever such a creature makes an ability check or saving throw while in the affected area, it can roll 1d4 and add the number rolled to the result. This blessing ends on a creature the next time it takes a long rest outside of the affected area. Once a structure or part of a structure has been blessed in this way, it can't be blessed in this way again for 1 year.

Blessing of Industry: You bless a vehicle, musical instrument, or set of artisan's tools, that you can see, selected when you cast the spell. Once each day for the following 7 days, a creature using the equipment can roll 1d4 and add the number rolled to a single check using that object. Once a creature has an object belonging to them blessed in this way, they may not have another object of the same type blessed for another year. For example, an individual may have a brewers kit blessed, then a boat blessed, but may not have their brewers kit blessed again for a year.

Blessing of the Pilgrim: You touch a creature, giving it protection for an upcoming voyage. For the next 7 days, that creature can roll 1d4 each time it makes a saving throw against exhaustion or inclement weather and add the number rolled to the result, provided that they are traveling to a single destination during that time. If they change destinations or reach their destination during that time, this effect ends. Once a creature receives this blessing, it can't do so again for 30 days.

Blessing of the Sick: You bless one creature you touch that is afflicted with a disease or poison. The creature immediately makes a saving throw against the effect with advantage. Once a creature receives this blessing, it can't do so again for a day.

    <text>You create an illusion of a vertical surface that is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall can include gaps and openings such as windows, peepholes, and doorways, but they are considered to be holes in the illusion as well. You can use a bonus action to move some or all of the gaps and openings, create new ones, or close the existing ones, but remember that the illusion can only be 1 foot across at its thickest point.
	Physical interaction with the wall reveals it to be an illusion, and a creature that uses its action to examine the wall can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the wall. Otherwise, the opaque sections block line of sight.

    <classes>School: Illusion, Artificer, Bard, Ranger, Wizard</classes>
    <text>You choose a creature, an object, or a place within range and create an illusion no larger than a 100 ft cube. If an arcane eye, clairvoyance, scrying spell, or similar magic would perceive the target, it instead perceives the illusion that you created when you cast this spell. This illusion can only be perceived by that type of magic, and does not affect creatures perceiving the target through nonmagical means. The illusion can include visuals, sounds, smells, tastes, and other stimuli, but it can't deal damage or impose conditions.
	For example, you could cast this spell on an area that includes the hallway of a gang's hideout, allowing you to walk through that hallway without notifying the warlock guards who are scrying on it.
	Suspicious creatures can attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC. On a success, they realize it's an illusion, but can't perceive past the illusion. If the spell is cast on a creature or object, it follows that creature or object.
	Casting this spell on the same area every day for 30 days makes this effect permanent.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the illusion can be 100 ft larger for each spell level above 4th.

You choose to make the wall up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight. A creature that is within 5 feet of the wall when the wall is created, or that ends its turn within 5 feet of the wall, must succeed on a Strength saving throw or else take 2d4 slashing damage and be restrained by the grasping arms. A restrained creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success, or taking 2d4 slashing damage on a failure. Each 5-foot square section has AC 5, 15 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. Reducing a section to 0 hit points destroys that section of the wall and frees a creature restrained by it.
