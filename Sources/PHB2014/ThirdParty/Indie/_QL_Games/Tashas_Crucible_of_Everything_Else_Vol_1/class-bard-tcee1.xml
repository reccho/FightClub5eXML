        <name>Bard College: College of Harmony (HB)</name>
        <text>Bards of the College of Harmony are masters of teamwork and bringing out the best in people. Often natural leaders, bards of this college sometimes favor coordinating the efforts of the party from a ranged position, while some choose to be on the front lines to inspire and encourage their allies.
	Not only do their abilities allow them to increase the effectiveness of their comrades, but these bards can bind the group together in magical harmony, allowing each of them to bestow protection on one another and to share in the beneficial effects the bard can produce.

        <name>Harmonic Bond (College of Harmony (HB))</name>
        <text>You learn to link your allies with magical synergy to inspire themselves and each other to keep in the fight. When a creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you takes damage, it can roll the die and reduce the damage taken by an amount equal to that number plus your Charisma modifier.
	Alternatively, a creature with a Bardic Inspiration die from you can use its reaction to grant this benefit to another creature within 30 feet of it, when that other creature takes damage.

        <name>Guided Initiative (College of Harmony (HB))</name>
        <text>You learn the guidance cantrip, which counts as a bard cantrip for you but doesn't count against your number of bard cantrips known. For you, it has a range of 30 feet.
	Additionally, whenever you roll initiative, you can use your reaction to grant one creature other than yourself within 30 feet of you a 1d4 bonus to its initiative result.

        <text>When you cast a spell that can only target one creature, and that does not have a range of Self, you can instead target two creatures if one of them has a Bardic Inspiration die from you.

        <name>Harmonic Link (College of Harmony (HB))</name>
        <text>You can link your allies in perfect harmony, working effortlessly as a team to bolster each other's defenses. When a creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you is hit by an attack, it can spend its die to magically reach out to nearby allies. Each creature within 30 feet can use its reaction to grant the target a +2 bonus to the targeted creature's AC.
	This effect is cumulative. For example, if two creatures use their reactions to grant this benefit, the creature gains a +4 bonus to its AC against the triggering attack.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Bard College: College of Pantomime (HB)</name>
        <text>The College of Pantomime is the home of bards who found that the world is a cacophonous place with too much noise and distractions to truly appreciate the Words of Creation or the magic which stemmed from it. They have therefore opted not to add their voices to the multitudes, instead choosing to remain silent, focusing instead on their movements and intentions to weave their magic as they trace the echoes of the Words of Creations which vibrate throughout the planes.
	Bards of this college are often considered odd and offputting. There's something about a performer who won't speak that seems to give onlookers a feeling that something just isn't right. This can be explained by the fact that these silent performers are in fact altering the weave around them through their intricate and specific movements. Members of this college are usually more level-headed than their counterparts from other colleges, or at least seem so since they can't voice any ridiculous plans they have out loud. Though those who spend enough time around them to gain an insight into their gesticulations may disagree with the previous assertion.

        <name>Silence is Golden (College of Pantomime (HB))</name>
        <text>When you join the College of Pantomime at 3rd level, you gain a better understanding of how to manipulate the weave of magic around you with your performance. When casting a spell you can replace any verbal components with somatic components. If a spell requires both verbal and somatic components, you can ignore the verbal components. By mastering the use of your gesticulations you have negated the need to vocalize your intentions.

        <name>Invisible Blades (College of Pantomime (HB))</name>
        <text>As a bonus action, you can expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration to pantomime an invisible blade in your hand. This blade deals 1d6 slashing damage and uses your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. It has the Light property. The blade ceases to exist after 1 hour, if you are incapacitated, or if you let go of it. You can also dismiss it at will.
	The damage for this attack increases when you reach 5th level (1d8), 10th level (1d10), and 15th level (1d12).

        <name>Convincing Performance (College of Pantomime (HB))</name>
        <text>As an action, you can mime the form of any inanimate object with which you are familiar, creating an invisible version of it in your hands. An object created in this way can be no larger than 3 feet on a side and weigh no more than 10 pounds. It ceases to exist after 1 hour, when you dismiss it as an action, when you use this feature again, or if it takes or deals any damage.
	You can't use this feature to create items that ordinarily require a high degree of craftsmanship, such as weapons or armor, unless you have proficiency with the type of artisan's tools used to craft such objects.

        <name>Trapped in a Box (College of Pantomime (HB))</name>
        <text>By perfecting the art of mime and listening for the Words of Creation, you have developed a mastery of imposing your vision and will on the weave around you.
	As an action, you may summon up to 6 invisible panels in any orientation and position in any unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you. Each panel must share at least one side with one other panel. The panels exist for up to 1 minute, until you dismiss them as an action, or until they are destroyed. The panels are 5 foot squares that are 1 inch thick. A creature can determine the location and orientation of these panels by interacting with them or by succeeding on a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC.
	If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the panels (or the panels and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the panels.
	The panels are magical objects, each one has AC 15 and 30 hit points, and is immune to poison and psychic damage. A dispel magic or disintegrate spell will immediately destroy a single panel.
	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and expended uses are replenished when you finish a long rest.
