    <text>This special stone has a hole naturally bored through the center. While attuned to this stone, you are immune to the charmed condition and fey have difficulty attacking you. When a fey creature attacks you, that creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

    <text>This 5-foot roll of sticky tape is imbued with a variation of the alarm spell. It functions as normal tape, unless you speak the command word when removing a portion. If a creature besides you cuts this portion of tape or removes it from its place, a blaring alarm produces the sound of an emergency claxon for 10 seconds, clearly audible within 600 feet.
	Only one portion of tape can be enchanted in this way at a time. If you attempt to activate another portion of tape with another piece already activated, the older portion deactivates.
	If you lose attunement with this tape, any activated portions immediately deactivate. Reattuning to the tape does not reactivate such a portion.

    <text>This dagger seems to bend, reaching toward those you have killed. This acts as a +1 dagger that deals necrotic damage rather than piercing damage. Once each day, when you kill a Small or Medium humanoid with this dagger, you can use your reaction to turn them into a zombie as if by the animate dead spell.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Proficiency: simple, dagger

    <text>This necklace has a narrow rectangular loop as a pendant, sized to fit a common coin. On inspection, it holds enchantments related to gambling and money. While attuned to the necklace, you have advantage on ability checks with gaming sets with which you are proficient.

Curse: When you attune to the necklace, it fuses to your body, with the slot becoming a small, seemingly bottomless hole on your chest. It can only be removed with a remove curse spell or similar magic. While attuned, you must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw after you use an action to attack, cast a spell, or make an ability check or else be paralyzed until the end of your next turn. The wearer or another creature within 5 feet of you may use an action or bonus action to insert a coin into the slot. After a coin has been inserted, you automatically succeed on one saving throw against the necklace for each gold piece in value inserted into the necklace. 1 hour after a coin is inserted, the benefit from it is wasted. The necklace mercifully does not give change.

This longbow is decorated with gems all up and down each side. You can use a bonus action to speak the longbow's command word and pick either acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage. For the rest of your turn, attacks with this longbow deal an additional 2d6 of the specified damage on a hit.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

    <text>A figurine of wondrous power is a statuette of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.
	The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.
	The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.

Coprolite Monkeys: These statuettes of chimpanzee-like apes in brownish stone are always created in sets of three. Each can become an ape for up to 10 minutes. Once it becomes an ape in this way, that statue can't be used again until 7 days have passed.
	As an action, each ape has the ability to grapple a creature, climbing onto the creature's back. While grappling a creature in this way, the ape can't take other actions and the creature is affected by a special condition, depending on the statue as described below. The effect lasts until the creature escapes the grapple or the ape turns back into a statue.
	One statue depicts an ape covering its eyes. Creatures grappled by this ape are blinded.
	One statue depicts an ape covering its ears. Creatures grappled by this ape are deafened.
	One statue depicts an ape covering its mouth. Creatures grappled by this ape can't speak, make sounds verbally, or perform the verbal components of spells.

A creature that can't use a manual of exotic golems and attempts to read it takes 8d6 psychic damage.

Manual of Exotic Golems:
1d20 | Manual Type | Time | Cost
1-10 | Manual of Snow Golems | 10 days | 5,000 gp
11-16 | Manual of Fiendish Flesh Golems | 75 days | 120,000 gp
17-18 | Manual of Adamantine Golems | 180 days | 200,00 gp
19-20 | Manual of Crystal Golems | 90 days | 100,000 gp

To create a golem, you must spend the time shown on the table, working without interruption with the manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours per day. You must also pay the specified cost to purchase supplies.
	Once you finish creating the golem, the book is consumed in eldritch flames. The golem becomes animate when the ashes of the manual are sprinkled on it. It is under your control, and it understands and obeys your spoken commands.

    <text>The mimaxe is a living weapon, the result of a mimic's unlucky encounter with a magical goblin blacksmith. You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic battleaxe.

Hungry: The mimaxe has 3 charges and recovers spent charges by consuming corpses. It takes 1 minute to consume a corpse. A Small corpse restores 1 charge, a Medium corpse 2, and a Large corpse 3. The mimaxe does not benefit from eating Tiny corpses and can't eat Huge or Gargantuan corpses. It can't have more than 3 charges at once, and a full mimaxe refuses to consume any additional corpses.
	The process of consuming a corpse is loud, obvious, and messy. Once consumed, the corpse is completely destroyed and any magic equipment on it is spat out into the nearest unoccupied space. The mimaxe does not change weight, regardless of what it has consumed.
	If the mimaxe goes 24 consecutive hours without eating a corpse, it loses 1 charge.

Roar: If you make an Intimidation check while wielding the mimaxe, you may spend one charge to gain advantage on the check.

Teeth: Whenever you hit a creature with this weapon, you may spend 1 charge to deal an additional 1d8 acid damage.

False Appearance: While the mimaxe remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary battleaxe.

Sentience: The mimaxe is a sentient chaotic neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 5, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 8. It has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and hearing out to a range of 120 feet. The weapon communicates verbally with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common.

Personality: The mimaxe is constantly hungry and desires to eat and be used in battle. It obeys its wielder as long as it's kept well-fed, but will act out and become unruly if hungry or left to its own devices. After 24 hours with 0 charges, the Mimaxe will attempt to break attunement and look for the nearest source of food, which may be its owner.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Proficiency: martial, battleaxe

    <text>This enchanted lock appears no different than its mundane equivalent. It requires a DC 15 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check to pick open. Each time a creature attempts to pick the lock and fails, the lock suddenly absorbs the lockpick and incorporates the material into its mechanism, effectively making the set of thieves' tools unusable. The DC to pick this lock then increases by 1, but can't increase above 25 in this way.
	Pick-eating locks encountered in adventuring environments often have higher DCs as a result of previous adventurers' failed attempts.

    <text>This fine white cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a rectangle that is 5 feet wide and 8 feet tall.
	You can use an action to unfold a portable hall and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon a passage forms until a creature uses its action to remove the cloth. This passage is 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and up to 20 feet long. The passage creates no instability in a structure surrounding it. If there is not an empty space for the passage to connect to within 20 feet, effectively creating a doorway or hallway, a passage is not created.
	When the passage disappears, any creatures or objects still within are safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the cloth.

    <magic>YES</magic>

    <text>Tasha's Cauldron is a massive bronze cauldron 3 feet high and nearly 4 feet across. The inner rim of the cauldron is carved with runes of power and control. Any liquid placed in the cauldron will start to steam after a minute and boil after 10 minutes whether or not the fire under the cauldron is lit. The cauldron has two thick bronze rings that serve as handles but the caudron is too heavy to be moved easily.
	The cauldron was originally a gift from Tasha's adopted mother, Baba Yaga. Baba Yaga was a witch of tremendous power who demanded the respect of both demon lords and angelic princes. Baba Yaga gave the cauldron to Tasha when Tasha announced her desire to explore the multiverse, to help her in her travels. However, the cauldron was so heavy Tasha was forced to leave it in Baba Yaga's chicken legged hut. Baba Yaga assured Tasha she would come if Tasha ever needed to use her cauldron, allowing the ancient witch to check up on her daughter. Tasha bristled at the thought of leaving such a powerful item with her mother, but it was too heavy to move. Tasha called on her adopted mother as sparingly as possible until she was able to create a permanent lair in the Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth. The cauldron served her well for the years she ruled a vast empire from the caverns, but it was lost when Tasha was forced to flee when armies of allied nations brought her empire to ruin.

Random Properties: Tasha's Caudron has the following random properties:

	• 2 minor beneficial properties 
	• 1 major beneficial property 
	• 2 minor detrimental properties 
	• 1 major detrimental property

Arcane Focus: You may use it as a spellcasting focus as long as you are within 20 feet of it. Three times each day, when you use it to cast a spell, the cauldron can produce the material components for the spell, worth up to 100 gold pieces. These material components disappear after the spell is cast, whether or not they are consumed by the spell. Uses for this ability recharges at dawn.

Potion Brewer: You can perform an 8-hour ritual to create one dose of any of the potions listed in Chapter 9 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. The cost of creating potions through this ritual is halved. You can have three potions brewed this way at once. If you brew a fourth potion using the cauldron, then the oldest potion turns to water permanently.

Poison Master: You can perform an 8-hour ritual to create one dose of any of the poisons listed in of the Dungeon Master's Guide (pg. 257-258). The cost of creating poisons through this ritual is halved. You can have one dose of poison brewed this way at once. If you brew a second dose of any poison using the cauldron, the older poison turns to water permanently.
	During the ritual you can choose a command word. The poison looks, tastes, and acts like water until you speak the command word within 100 feet of it. The poison does not convert to its true form if it has been administered to a creature or consumed by a creature, or if you or the poison are within a silence spell or antimagic field.

Cauldron's Legion: Once each day you can perform a 1-hour ritual to summon a demon of your choice. This ritual requires rare ingredients, worth 500 gp for every level of Challenge Rating the demon has (minimum of 250 gp). These ingredients are then consumed by the ritual. At the end of the ritual, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check, with a DC equal to 5 + the CR of the summoned demon. On a failed check, nothing happens. On a successful check, the demon appears floating in the space above the cauldron and must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC.
	On a failed save, it is charmed by you and under the effects of a geas spell for 1 year. You can order it to complete one task for you, which it is magically compelled to do. After completing this task, the demon returns to the Abyss.
	On a successful save, the demon is restrained and grappled by magic bonds above the cauldron for up to 1 minute. It can use its action to attempt a Strength saving throw to break free of these bonds. The DC for this saving throw is equal to your spell save DC. It can return to the Abyss at will, or magically returns to the Abyss after 1 minute.
	Only one demon can be summoned or under your control through this ritual at a time. If you try to use this ability on a second demon, the effect immediately ends on the first demon. The first demon will know of this and will be free to plot its revenge.

Pierce the Veil: Three times each day you can perform a 10 minute ritual to cast the scrying spell using the cauldron. The cauldron can target creatures or areas not on the same plane of existence as you, and ignores the effects of any spell of 8th level or lower that prevents scrying, such as the nondetection spell. If the targeted creature or area is under the effects of a 9th-level spell or other magical effect that prevents scrying, you must make a DC 19 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If you succeed, your scrying spell ignores the protective magic. If you fail, the scrying spell fails and is wasted.

Destroying Tasha's Cauldron: Destroying Tasha's Cauldron is one of the most difficult prospects in the multiverse. Tasha must be slain, and her body placed into the cauldron. You must then perform a special 8-hour ritual that drains the magic of the cauldron, resurrecting Tasha. She will be furious at the destruction of her cauldron and will teleport away to plot her revenge. Baba Yaga will also know the cauldron was destroyed and will come to check on her adopted daughter.

    <text>This black dagger confers some of its unseelie darkness on its targets. Once each turn when you hit a creature with this weapon, you can choose to curse the creature until the end of its next turn. The cursed creature has darkvision with a radius of 60 feet, and has disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight whenever it, its target, or the thing it's trying to perceive is in sunlight.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

    <text>This necklace is made from teeth taken from a living wereboar and strung onto silver wire in a cruel ritual. While attuned to this item, you can use your action to polymorph into a giant boar, as if by the polymorph spell. The necklace does not meld into the boar form, but changes size and remains around the boar's neck. Once used, you can't use this ability again until you finish a short or long rest.

Curse: The necklace is cursed and becoming attuned to it extends that curse to you. As long as you remain cursed in this way, the necklace tightens around your neck and can't be removed except by a remove curse spell or similar magic. While cursed, you are vulnerable to bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage from silvered weapons. Whenever you take bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from any source, you must succeed on a DC10 Constitution saving throw or else take an additional 1d4 slashing damage as the necklace digs into your skin. If you fail this saving throw by 5 or more, you contract lycanthropy and become a wereboar.
