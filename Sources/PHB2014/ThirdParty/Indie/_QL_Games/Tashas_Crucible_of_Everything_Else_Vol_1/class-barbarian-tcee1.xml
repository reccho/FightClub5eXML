        <name>Primal Path: Path of Infiltration (HB)</name>
        <text>To barbarians who follow the Path of Infiltration, rage does not mean battle cries and violent screams. Instead, it means deafening silence and uncertain shadows. Drawing upon magic from the Shadowfell, these infiltrators breathe in sound and light and hold it within, suppressing it as they lay waste to enemies, doors, and any other barriers between them and their goal.
	In the world of Ravnica, House Dimir makes ample use of these barbarians. In the Forgotten Realms, the Zhentarim includes such ranks. Thieves' guilds, cults, or noble houses might also recruit these silent terrors as thieves or assassins.
	These powers are usually gained from dark rituals or curses. In either case, obtaining and using these powers is often painful, causing these barbarians to become part shadow and suffer—and make others suffer—in silence. At your option, you can pick from or roll on the Infiltration Barbarian Quirks table to create a quirk for your character.

Infiltration Barbarian Quirks:
1d6 | Quirk
1 | Your eyes are pitch black.
2 | You get headaches from bright light and loud noises.
3 | You often wake up screaming, but make no noise when you do.
4 | Your blood is black and quickly evaporates into shadowy mist.
5 | You have a habit of unintentionally sneaking up on people.
6 | You rarely talk, preferring to write or gesture instead.

        <name>Breaking and Entering (Path of Infiltration (HB))</name>
        <text>You become adept at finding a way past nearly any obstacle:

	• You deal double damage to objects.

	• You can use a bonus action on each of your turns to make a single weapon attack against an object that isn't being worn or carried.

	• While you are raging, your rage doesn't end early as long as you end your turn in dim light or darkness.

        <name>Silent Rage (Path of Infiltration (HB))</name>
        <text>Whenever you enter a rage, you can inhale light and sound to create a magical aura of silence and shadow. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover. Your aura lasts until you dismiss it as a bonus action or your rage ends.
	Your aura acts as the areas of both a silence spell and of a pass without trace spell. You can still use your Danger Sense even while you are deafened by your aura.
	If you are targeted by a dispel magic spell, your aura counts as a spell with a level equal to half your barbarian level.

	In addition, dim light doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on sight.

        <text>While you're raging, you are under the effects of a nondetection spell, and whenever you would trigger an abjuration spell, such as by walking through the area of an alarm or glyph of warding, you can make a Constitution saving throw (DC 10 + the spell's level). On a successful save, the spell isn't triggered.
	Additionally, while you benefit from your Danger Sense, the damage you take from traps is halved. This includes magical traps, such as the glyph of warding or symbol spells.

        <text>As an action on your turn, you can take on an incorporeal, shadowy form. Until the end of the turn, you can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. If you occupy the same spot as a solid object or creature when the turn ends, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and take 1d10 force damage for every 5 feet you are moved. If you take this action while raging, your rage doesn't end early at the end of the turn.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Primal Path: Path of the Abomination (HB)</name>
        <text>There are whispers of barbarian tribes that possess otherworldly abilities, able to take on grotesque forms that defy the laws of the natural world. Some say these barbarians happened upon a long forgotten elder being, or they are the remains of a once knowledgeable cult driven mad by the things they discovered. Others say they are not native to the material plane at all but instead travelled here from the Far Realm millenia ago.
	Regardless of their origin, these vile warriors often perform ancient and evil magic rituals of mutilation to transform their flesh. These actions warp both their bodies and minds in horrific ways that augment their already profound combat abilities.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Eldritch Transformation (Path of the Abomination (HB))</name>
        <text>You learn to perform vile rituals to improve your capabilities and strike terror into the hearts of your foes. These manifest as horrific physical transformations during the height of your fury. When you rage, choose a transformation from one of the options detailed below. Your choice lasts for the duration of the rage.

Bloated Form. While raging, your body swells to an unnatural and bloated state. You increase in size by one category (from Medium to Large, for example), your carrying capacity is doubled, and you have advantage on saving throws that would move you or knock you prone.

Corrupted Flesh. While raging, your skin hardens in a scaly or scab-like manner, granting you a +1 bonus to your AC. As a reaction, when you fail a Constitution or Dexterity saving throw you can shed the skin to reroll, using the new result. If you do so, the bonus to your AC ends.

Reprehensible Stench. While raging, you emit a foul scented cloud of decaying matter, potentially sickening those in an area around you. When a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a weapon attack, it takes 1d4 poison damage. The damage die increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 1d6 at 10th level, 1d8 at 15th level, and 1d10 at 20th level.

        <name>Aberrant Form (Path of the Abomination (HB))</name>
        <text>Your dedication to the maddening forces of ancient evils has granted you a permanent benefit. Choose one of the following options.

Unsightly Visage. Your appearance takes on a permanent repulsive form-perhaps additional eyes on your neck or tiny tentacles across your face. You gain advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks but disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks against creatures that can see you.

Gruesome Appendage. A partially-functional extra arm or tentacle grows from your torso. The appendage can't wield weapons or a shield, but can manipulate simple objects. While the appendage is not carrying anything, you can use a bonus action to take the Use an Object action.

Slithering Skin. Your body begins to produce an oily and repulsive slime. You have advantage on saving throws to avoid being grappled or restrained as well as advantage on ability checks made to escape a grapple.

        <name>Twisted Metamorphosis (Path of the Abomination (HB))</name>
        <text>You have mastered ancient techniques and dark rituals to be able to truly become an unrecognisable shadow of your former self. As part of a long rest, you can spend 1 hour performing a ritual to transform yourself in one of the ways detailed below. The metamorphosis lasts until you use this feature again or until you finish a long rest.
	If your transformation's effects require a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

Unstoppable Bulk. Your body becomes a mass of writhing flesh. While raging, you can use a bonus action to take the Dash action. If you end the dash next to a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you and take bludgeoning damage equal to 1d12 + your Strength modifier. 

Vile Presence. Your appearance becomes the stuff of nightmares, preventing enemies from escaping through sheer terror. While you're raging, you can use a reaction after hitting a creature to force it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 psychic damage and falls prone. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. A creature is also immune to this effect if it can't see or hear you or if it can't be frightened.

Tentacled Fury. You can transform your arms into powerful eldritch tentacles. While you are raging, you can use a bonus action to increase your reach with melee weapon attacks by 15 feet until the end of your turn. If you hit a target while using this feature, you can choose to drag the creature towards you. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 10 feet in a straight line toward you.

        <name>Primal Path: Path of the Alchemical Brute (HB)</name>
        <text>You have been unflinchingly exposed to the brutal violence people are capable of. Underneath the thin veneer of civility, rage and fury lurks within everyone, no matter how mild mannered they appear under normal circumstances. Given the right conditions, everyone is capable of becoming a monster. Including you.
	You move in polite society as well as anyone else, and are possessed of a level of intellect unusual to other barbarians. Through careful study and alchemical experimentation, you have learned to tap into the primal beast inside you, and manifest it in physical ways.

        <name>Bonus Proficiencies (Path of the Alchemical Brute (HB))</name>
        <text>When you choose this archetype, it represents the culmination of your research into alchemically altering your biology and psychology.
	You gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies, the Medicine skill, and Intelligence saving throws. If you are already proficient in alchemist's supplies or the Medicine skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to ability checks you make that use them.

Genius Bruisers:
Many alchemical formulae and path features described here make extensive use of Intelligence, an ability score not usually considered very important for barbarians. If you plan to take this subclass at 3rd level, consider putting your highest ability score in Strength, followed by Intelligence as your second highest ability score.

        <name>Alchemical Preparation (Path of the Alchemical Brute (HB))</name>
        <text>You have refined your experiments and discovered alchemical formulae that, when administered, can alter your body and mind whenever you enter a rage. You know 3 alchemical formulae from the Alchemical Formulae spell list.
	You prepare doses of these formulae when you finish a long rest, provided you have a set of Alchemist's supplies available to you. You prepare one dose of each formula, which are unstable and lose their potency 24 hours after you prepare them. The physical nature of how you administer your formulae is up to you (such as vials of liquid you drink, a mist you inhale, an injection, etc.)
	Whenever you enter a rage, you may expend a dose of one of your prepared alchemical formulae, granting you its effects for the duration of that rage. Your prepared alchemical formulae have no effect if used by creatures other than you, or if you attempt to administer them when not entering a rage, as they are tailored to your own unique body chemistry and psychology.
	Some formulae require creatures to make saving throws to resist their effects. The DC to resist a formula's effect is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.

When you gain a feature that allows you to discover alchemical formulae, you choose from those in the "Barbarian (Alchemical Brute): Alchemical Formulae" spell list. You can select an alchemical formula only once, unless otherwise specified.

        <text>Your biological experiments upon yourself have had a lasting effect on your body, even when not raging. You may use your Intelligence modifier in place of your Constitution modifier when calculating your AC using your barbarian Unarmored Defense feature, to determine how many hit points you restore when you roll a Hit Die, and for calculating your maximum hit points. You may recalculate your hit point maximum retroactively when you gain this feature. When you reach 20th level in this class, you can choose to increase your Intelligence score by 4 instead of your Constitution score. Your maximum for that score then becomes 24.
