        <name>Otherworldly Patron: The Creeping Vine (HB)</name>
        <text>Your patron is a magical plant, a powerful primal spirit, or some other grand entity of nature and growth, such as a powerful treant, an ancient green dragon, a totoro, or an archdryad. This being might seek to expand itself and its influence through seed or spore, or it might want to simply perpetuate, accelerate, or otherwise enable the natural cycles of life. In the Forgotten Realms, such beings include the Great Oak of Kuldahar and Zuggtmoy, the Demon Queen of Fungi. In the world of Eberron, the daelkyr Avassh might be your patron, and in the world of Ravnica, the Selesnya Conclave might be the source of your powers.

        <name>Biome (The Creeping Vine (HB))</name>
        <text>You gain one of the following features, based on a biome of your choice.

Arid. You retain scarce resources like a cactus retains water. When you expend a Pact Magic spell slot on a spell that targets only one creature, and that spell has no effect on the target, you regain the spell slot.

Boreal. Like a pine tree in the taiga, you can enter a state of hibernation. As an action, you can turn yourself and your equipment to solid wood. You are petrified in a special way. You have all the traits of the petrified condition, except you remain conscious of your surroundings, you can perceive through your senses as normal, and your weight remains the same. You float in water, you are inflammable, and you do not need to eat, breathe, drink, or sleep. You can't benefit from short or long rests while in this form. You can exit this state at any time (no action required), but no sooner than 1 hour after entering it. Once you have used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

Jungle. You can entangle and ensnare your foes in creepers and vines. You learn the thorn whip cantrip. It counts as a warlock spell for you but doesn't count against the number of cantrips you can know. When you cast it, you can make one melee weapon attack as a bonus action. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

        <text>As a reaction when a Huge or smaller creature makes a melee attack against you, you can summon spectral vines to entangle it immediately before it strikes you. The creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained until the end of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

Algae. You gain resistance to slashing damage.
Leaf. You gain resistance to bludgeoning damage.
Wood. You gain resistance to piercing damage.

	Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

        <name>Otherworldly Patron: The Inevitable (HB)</name>
        <text>the inevitable  the inevitable  You have forged a contract with an inevitable, an axiomatic being from one of the planes of law set to uphold and enforce order across the multiverse. Whether you sought these powers purposely, misunderstood an agreement you were making, or now serve as punishment for breaching a contract, your patron's powers allow you to impose law and order, sidestepping fate and luck instead for the blessing of definite results.
	Perhaps you forged a contract in the Halls of Concordance. If so, your patron may be a quarut, marut, or kolyarut of Mechanus. In the world of Ravnica, a high ranking member of the Azorius Senate might act as your patron, or your powers might come from the Guild Pact itself.
	Your contract may require you to assist in establishing order in various ways. You can choose a directive, allow your DM to choose one, or determine one randomly, using the Inevitable Directive table.

Inevitable Directive:
1d6 | Directive
1 | To hunt fugitives of the law and those who try to escape punishment.
2 | To write, deliver, or witness the signing of minor contracts.
3 | To apprehend those who break interplanar contracts.
4 | To enforce the laws of life and death, hunting those who would deny the grave or otherwise disrupt the flow of souls into the afterlife.
5 | To maintain the laws of space and time, investigating permanent portals between planes or temporal disruptions and disorder.
6 | To support the divine order and help stop those who seek to destroy or become gods.

Your Contract:
To an inevitable, the spirit of an agreement is nothing, and the letter of the law is everything. Work with your DM to determine the nature of your contract, how it might be enforced, what directive best suits your campaign, how closely you might be monitored, and what the consequences might be for breaking it. Breaking your contract, however, shouldn't mean an immediate end for your character. Instead, it should create interesting and meaningful complications.  For example, if you serve a marut hunting someone who broke an extraplanar contract, your patron may suddenly appear to drag you back to the Halls for judgement should you be discovered aiding your quarry or allowing it to escape justice. As punishment, you might temporarily lose access to one or more of your warlock class features, or be assigned a proctor to observe you more carefully, such as a modron for a familiar.

        <text>This remastered version aims to bring the Undying warlock up to snuff with other warlock subclasses or subclasses with a similar narrative in the following ways:

	• Empowers your Undying Nature feature to be as useful as most other 10th-level warlock subclass features.

	• Minor adjustments to the Among the Dead, Defy Death, and Expanded Spell List features to better enable your ability to keep your allies alive.

	• Replaces your Indestructible Life feature with a different mechanic that better fits the narrative that you are very hard to kill.

	Additionally, undead have difficulty harming you. If an undead targets you directly with an attack or a harmful spell, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC (an undead needn't make the save when it includes you in an area effect, such as the explosion of fireball). On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or forfeit targeting someone instead of you, potentially wasting the attack or spell. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. An undead is also immune to this effect for 24 hours if you target it with an attack or a harmful spell.

Once you have been revived in this way, you can't be so again for 7 days.
