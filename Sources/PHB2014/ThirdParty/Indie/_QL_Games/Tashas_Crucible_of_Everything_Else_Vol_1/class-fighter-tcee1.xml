        <name>Martial Archetype: Bodyguard (HB)</name>
        <text>Bodyguards are highly skilled fighters that hone their skills and reflexes to recognize and react to threats swiftly, warn others of danger, and if necessary, put themselves in harms way to protect their charges.
	Anyone with the unflinching devotion to protect their allies can excel as a bodyguard. In the Forgotten Realms, the Masked Lords of Waterdeep often secure the services of bodyguards, as do many wealthy merchants traveling up and down the Sword Coast. In Eberron, the most famed and respected bodyguards in the Five Nations belong to House Deneith's Defenders Guild, followed closely by distinguished members of House Medani's Warning Guild.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Selfless Guardian (Bodyguard (HB))</name>
        <text>You have honed your reflexes to instinctively interpose yourself between your allies and danger. Whenever an ally you can see would take damage, you may move up to half your speed directly toward that ally as a reaction. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. If this movement brings you within 5 feet of your ally, you may choose to take the damage they would be dealt in their stead.
	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.

        <text>You develop a talent for instinctively recognizing hostile intentions. You gain proficiency in the Insight skill if you do not have it already. Whenever you make a Wisdom (Insight) check to determine whether a creature intends harm toward you or an ally you can see, treat a roll of 7 or lower on the d20 as an 8.

	Lastly, after using your Selfless Guardian feature, all of your attacks deal an additional 1d10 damage to creatures that attempted to deal damage to allies within 5 feet of you, until the end of your next turn.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Martial Archetype: Fencer (HB)</name>
        <text>Fencers are highly skilled duelists and swordmasters. These quick-footed warriors forego the usual heavy armor that most fighters wear, in favor of unfettered movement and flexibility. Fencers have a flair for style and panache, and usually seize victory with a cunningly precise strike that leaves their foes baffled, and shortly thereafter, bleeding. Some fencers are rumored to be unsavory rakes and scoundrels, while many others are featured in songs and chronicles as heroes with a bold and audacious air. Some of these seedy rumors and heroic retellings might actually refer to the same person!

Dashing Swordfighters:
Many of the Fencer's features described here make extensive use of Charisma, an ability score not usually considered very important to fighters. If you plan to take this subclass at 3rd level, consider putting your two highest ability scores in Dexterity and Charisma.

        <name>Bonus Proficiency (Fencer (HB))</name>
        <text>Fencers often train in more diverse skill sets than is typical for fighters. You gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Acrobatics, Deception, Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Precise Flourish (Fencer (HB))</name>
        <text>You have incorporated stylistic flair into your fighting style that masks your deadly precision. When you make a melee weapon attack with a finesse weapon wielded in one hand, and have nothing in your other hand, you may spend a Precision Die, a d8, to roll it and add the result to the attack roll. You may also perform a flourish that confounds or hinders the target. You may decide to roll the Precision Die and declare which flourish you perform after seeing the result of your attack roll, but you must do so before you know whether the attack hits or misses.
	You have a number of Precision Dice equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one), and you regain all spent Precision Dice when you finish a short or long rest.
	If a flourish requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency modifier + your Charisma modifier. On a successful save, the target becomes immune to all of your flourishes until it finishes a short or long rest. You may choose any of the below flourishes:

Befuddling Routine. You incorporate such complex movements in your attack routine that your opponent is left briefly unsure of its next move. The target of your attack must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn.

Demoralizing Feint. You use your attack to cleverly disguise a feint that leaves your opponent looking foolishly outmatched. The target of your attack has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the start of your next turn.

Disarming Sweep. The target of your attack must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or drop one item of your choice that it is holding. As a reaction, you may choose to either catch the creature's dropped item in your other hand, or fling it up to 15 feet away.

        <text>You incorporate your sense of panache into your flexible defensive style. While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 11 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier.
	Additionally, when you reach 10th level in this class, you gain proficiency in Dexterity saving throws while you are wearing no armor nor wielding a shield.

        <text>When you are wielding a finesse weapon in one hand and have nothing in your other hand, and another creature hits you with a melee attack, you may spend a Precision Die as a reaction to roll it and add its result to your AC against that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss.
	If the creature's attack does miss, you may immediately make a melee weapon attack against the creature. If your attack hits, you don't add your ability modifier to the damage roll, unless that modifier is negative.

        <text>Some fighters hone their combat skills through sheer discipline and endless hours of training. They study tactics and techniques developed by time-honored experts in the art of war, and aspire to join their ranks.
	You are not one of those fighters.
	Scrappers learn to defend themselves on the street and in the tavern, fighting dirty and grabbing whatever's at hand for a weapon. They're probably grinning the whole time, too, except for when they're spitting out teeth.

	After dealing damage, you can deal an additional 1d4 damage if you declare that the blow has shattered, splintered, or otherwise broken the improvised weapon beyond further use. You can't do this if the improvised weapon is a magic item.
	At 10th level, this extra damage increases from 1d4 to 1d8.

        <name>Dirty Fighting (Scrapper (HB))</name>
        <text>Only fools fight fair. You learn a few dirty tricks you can use in combat. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can use one dirty trick as long as you aren't wielding a weapon with the Two-Handed property and aren't wearing heavy armor.
	You have a number of trick points equal to twice your proficiency bonus. When you use a dirty trick, you spend one or more trick points, each of which deals an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage to the target as part of the attack. The maximum number of trick points you can spend on a single dirty trick is equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all spent trick points when you complete a short or long rest.
	If a dirty trick requires a saving throw, the DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier.

Low Blow. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or fall prone if it is your size or smaller. This trick has no effect against creatures with more than two legs.

Go For the Eyes. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or become blinded until the end of its next turn. This trick has no effect on creatures without eyes.

Smash Nose. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to take reactions until the start of its next turn. This trick has no effect on creatures without a face.

If they're your size, you can throw them half that distance. If they're one size larger than you, you throw them a number of feet equal to your Strength modifier (minimum 1 foot). The creature falls prone and takes bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier, plus 1d8 bludgeoning damage for every 5 feet you threw it, rounded down. If the creature would strike an object, structure, or other creature, the struck target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or else take an equal amount of damage. The thrown creature then stops moving. If the struck target is the same size as or smaller than the thrown creature and fails the saving throw, it is also knocked prone.

        <text>You're always expecting a fight. When you spend at least 1 minute observing your immediate environment and the creatures in it, you learn certain details likely to be of use in the event that violence breaks out. The environment must be a confined space, such as a room, or an open space in an urban setting.
	Ask the DM up to three of the following questions, and they must respond truthfully.

	• Which creatures here have notable combat training or experience?
	• Which creatures here are a danger to me or my allies?
	• Which creatures here have more hit points than I do?
	• Who's in charge here?
	• What's useful to me here?
	• What's my best way out of here?

In addition, if a fight breaks out in that environment within the next hour, you have advantage on your initiative roll and can't be surprised.
