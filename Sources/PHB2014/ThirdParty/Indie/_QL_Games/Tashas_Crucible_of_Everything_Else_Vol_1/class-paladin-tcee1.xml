        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Enlightenment (HB)</name>
        <text>The Oath of Enlightenment is taken by paladins who seek for learning and growth and to share such knowledge and experience with others. As often as others call them teacher or mentor, they call themselves student and pupil.
	These paladins spend much of their time trying to build up others, but they are also dedicated to bettering themselves. As they understand other people, they begin to comprehend their own place in the cosmos on a level rivaled by few. The greatest reach a transcendence that allows them to ignore limitations of the planes, levitating and teleporting as they wish.
	Paladins of this oath seek learning as a means to improve their connection to and understanding of their god and the domains of their god's portfolio. Some carry sketch pads and notebooks to record their learnings, while others might bring mats or wear caps to help them focus as they meditate and ponder on recent discoveries.

Tenets of Enlightenment:
The tenets of the Oath of Enlightenment teach a paladin to seek learning whenever they can and to share it just as often.

Knowledge is Power. The greater your understanding, the greater your influence.

Lifelong Learning. Enlightenment can only be achieved by persistent curiosity and a humble willingness to learn.

Teach the Untaught. Nothing worth learning should be kept to yourself; your knowledge and experience ought to be shared with the world, that others might learn as you have.

Seek First to Understand. Understanding others is more important than being right. Once you understand them, then you can teach them.

You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of Enlightenment Spells table. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how oath spells work.
