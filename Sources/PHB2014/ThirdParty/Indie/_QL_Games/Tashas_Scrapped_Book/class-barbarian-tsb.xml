        <name>Primal Path: Path of the Giant (HB)</name>
        <text>Many tales tell the story of huge giants, colossal behemoths who guard mountain passages and oppose entire armies. Those who seek to emulate them find the path of the giant, throwing boulders and swinging trees as they chase comparatively weak intruders away from their homes. Few things are more terrifying than to hear the rumbling approach of one such warrior, especially when accompanied by their shouting, bellowing, and the telltale phrase "I smell the blood..."

        <text>Having disadvantage on strength checks, strength saving throws, and reckless attacks does not negate your advantage while raging as long as you can discern the location of the target.

        <name>Powerful Presence (Path of the Giant (HB))</name>
        <text>While raging, magic can't put you to sleep, you cannot be charmed, and creatures have disadvantage on rolls made to resist your intimidating or frightening them. You can also use your bonus action to grant a willing creature one of these effects until the beginning of its next turn.

        <name>Colossal Impact (Path of the Giant (HB))</name>
        <text>6th-level Path of the Giant feature When you hit a creature with a rock, and the rock is larger than the target, the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw where the DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier. On a failure, the target is knocked prone and pushed up to 10 feet away from you. If the target fails by more than 5, the target's speed also becomes 0 until the target succeeds. The target may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of it's turns.

        <name>Titanic Hold (Path of the Giant (HB))</name>
        <text>Weapons (including improvised weapons and rocks)
without the heavy or two-handed properties count as light weapons for you. Weapons that do have the heavy or two-handed properties can be wielded in a single hand for the purposes of your attacks.
	Additionally, you can use your reaction to make a single weapon attack when a creature enters your melee range or when a creature already within your melee range hits you with an attack. If your attack misses or deals less damage than half your level in barbarian, the attack does not expend your reaction.
