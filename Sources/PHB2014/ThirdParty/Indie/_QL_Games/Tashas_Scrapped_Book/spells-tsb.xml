Each creature within 30 feet of the place where the attack makes contact must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded. Creatures you designate have advantage on this saving throw. This spell has no effect on creatures without eyes, creatures that do not use their eyes to see, or creatures that have other means of sight besides their eyes. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effects on itself on a success.

    <text>You attempt to take control of a fey creature that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be controlled by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.
	While the fey creature is controlled, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature," "Run over there," or
"Fetch that object." If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.
	You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.
	Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot above 4th level.

Invoking the laws of the Pact Primeval, you bind willing creatures into a contract which ensures everyone involved upholds their end of the bargain.
	In preparation for you casting the spell, each entity to be involved with and bound by the contract must willingly provide a vial of its own blood, which is then mixed with ink. The magical ink used to draft this contract cannot be made invisible, glows red, and is warm to the touch. Additionally, any text written with this ink can be understood by entities whose blood has been used in the ink's creation, regardless of the language or handwriting style used.
	The spell can only be cast if all entities whose blood is mixed with the ink have signed it with their true names. Whenever a clause is added or removed, any existing signature disappears. If a creature has less than 8 Intelligence, Wisdom and/or Charisma at the moment the spell is cast, if it has been coerced by force, threats or magic into signing, or if it signs with anything other than its true name, the magic does not take hold, and the spell's components are wasted.
	The contract bursts in flames after it is signed by all involved parties. From the moment the contract is in effect to the moment it is terminated, all involved parties can magically summon or dismiss a copy of the contract into existence as an action. Unless specified otherwise, the contract is terminated when one of the parties dies.
	The contract must contain at least the following two elements: commitments and exit clauses.

Commitments:
Each party involved makes one or more promises to the other parties. If one of the commitments is not met, then the contract is terminated, and the exit clause for the party who failed to deliver on their promise is invoked.
	This magical contract allows you to do transactions that could not be performed without magic. However, the contract cannot allow you to give something you do not possess. Here are examples of possible commitments:

	• Arcane Power. You give the recipient some of the spells you know, and some of your spell slots. The recipient can cast those spells, using those spell slots. They use their own spellcasting ability modifier, using the same Ability Score you would have used to cast those spells. These spells and spell slots are not available to you anymore, until the contract is terminated. This is often what is offered to Warlocks.

	• Memory. The recipient is given your memory of an event. The contract may let you keep a copy of these memories, or they are lost to you until the contract is terminated. This is often used in courts, to ensure the veracity of a testimony.

	• A sense. You can decide to either give, or share a sense with another party. If you give your sense of sight to a blind person, they will regain their vision, but you will lose yours. You could decide to share a sense instead. If you do, the blind person will not regain their vision-instead, they will see everything that you see, from your point of view, until the contract is terminated.

	• A favor. You can specify a task to be completed before a certain date. Alternatively, you can specify a number of favors to be reclaimed later.

	• Your eternal soul. If an entity possesses your soul, they can summon your soul within 30 feet of them as an action, or dismiss your soul back to where it was before you were summoned in the same way. They can read your thoughts, and have access to all of your memories. You are unable to disobey any verbal or telepathic command they give you, and they know if you tell them a lie. Finally, while your soul is forfeit, you cannot sign any additional infernal contract.

Unless specified otherwise within the contract, when the contract is terminated for any reason, the contract magically returns any item, experience, memory, sense, favor, or soul that had been given to their original owners.
	If a commitment can be interpreted in different ways, the party who makes the commitment decides which interpretation is correct when they make it.

Exit Clauses:
You must describe what happens to each party should they fail to deliver on their commitments within the agreed upon timeframe. Again, the contract can enforce things through the use of magic that would otherwise be impossible. Here are examples of common exit clauses:

	• Curse. The faulty party receives a curse, as per the bestow curse spell, as if it had been cast as a 9th level spell. They fail the saving throw automatically.

	• Recall. The faulty party is teleported to the location where the contract was signed.

	• Imprisonment. The faulty party is imprisoned, as per the imprisonment spell, for a duration to be specified. They fail the saving throw automatically.

	• Compensation. The faulty party makes a new commitment as a penalty. For example, the party could have their ability to speak taken away as punishment.

	• Punishment. The faulty party suffers one of the effects of the symbol spell. They fail the saving throw automatically.

A wish spell can be used to terminate the contract without being subjected to its exit clauses.
	If an exit clause can be interpreted in different ways, the parties who did not fail their commitments decide which interpretation is correct when the exit clause is invoked.
	Long ago, the Fey collectively signed an infernal contract which made it so their word became magically binding. Because of this, any promise or agreement made orally to or by a fey creature instantly results in the casting of this spell, with clauses determined automatically.

    <text>You can use this magic as a means of transporting bonded creature companions, blending in with busy city streets, or hiding them away during stealthy endeavours.
	As an action, you can touch a willing creature with a CR up to 1/3 of your level and absorb their essence into your body. For as long as you concentrate up to 8 hours (or until you use an action to end the effect early) the companion appears on your body as a mark that relates to them. This can be a claw scar, an eagle tattoo, or even a birthmark in the shape of an otter. You can choose a new appearance every time you cast this spell. While absorbed this way, the companion sees what you see and can communicate telepathically with you as if they were walking right alongside you.
	When the spell ends, the creature appears in the nearest unoccupied space of your choice.

One humanoid that you can see within 5 feet of you must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be possessed by you; you then disappear, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. You now control the body but don't deprive the target of awareness. You can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and you retain your alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and class abilities and features. You otherwise use the possessed target's statistics, but don't gain access to the target's knowledge, features, or proficiencies. The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, you end it as a bonus action, or you are turned or forced out by an effect such as dispel evil and good. When the possession ends, you reappear in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body in your true form. The target is immune to this spell for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the spell ends.

    <text>Select a 20-foot square within range. Each creature in the chosen area must make a Constitution saving throw or rise vertically, up to 20 feet, and remain suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate targets that weigh up to 1000 pounds.
	The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. As a bonus action, you can choose to lower or raise each creature in the area by 20 feet and up to 60 feet into the air. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your bonus action to move the target, which must remain within the spell's range.
	When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft.
