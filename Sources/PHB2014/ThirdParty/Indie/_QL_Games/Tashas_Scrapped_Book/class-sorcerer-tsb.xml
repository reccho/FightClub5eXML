        <name>Sorcerous Origin: Hexblood Sorcery (HB)</name>
        <text>The power of an ancient curse flows through your veins. Perhaps an ancestor of yours was cursed by an old crone, or perhaps you are descended from a hag or powerful witch yourself. Whatever the circumstance, ill fortune courses through the blood of your family. For generations your bloodline has been marked by disaster and failure.
	But for you, this magical curse has quickened, kindling within you dark sorcerous power. For you have gained instinctive control over the ill fortune of your family, and now you wield the hex of your blood as you see fit.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Black Magic (Hexblood Sorcery (HB))</name>
        <text>You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Black Magic Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.
	Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be a necromancy or an enchantment spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list.

1st | hex, sleep, toll the dead
3rd | ray of enfeeblement, Tasha's mind whip

        <name>Twisting Hex (Hexblood Sorcery (HB))</name>
        <text>When your sorcerous powers developed, you gained mastery over the ill-fortune in your blood, allowing you to inflict it on others. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you is about to roll a d20 with advantage, you can use your reaction to roll a d20 of your own and replace one of the creature's rolls with yours, provided your result is lower than one of the creature's rolls. Creatures immune to being cursed are immune to this effect. Once you have affected a creature with Twisting Hex, the creature is immune to your Twisting Hex for 24 hours.

        <name>Cursed Resistance (Hexblood Sorcery (HB))</name>
        <text>The fell magic coursing through you makes it harder for foreign black magic to affect you. You gain resistance to necrotic and psychic damage and you cannot be cursed.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Blood Magic (Hexblood Sorcery (HB))</name>
        <text>You gain control over the witchcraft inherent in your own blood, allowing you to use it to infuse your spells with blood magic. Whenever you cast a spell, you may choose to apply a metamagic effect to it that you don't currently know, expending sorcery points as normal. If you do, however, you roll a number of d10s equal to the sorcery point cost of the metamagic effect and take necrotic damage equal to the result of the roll. This damage cannot be mitigated in any way.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Mortal Hex (Hexblood Sorcery (HB))</name>
        <text>Harnessing your fell influence over fate and luck, you can inflict a creature with a momentary but devastating curse at the worst possible instant. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you is about to roll a d20, you can reduce the result of their roll by 10. Creatures immune to being cursed are immune to this effect. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 7 sorcery points to use it again.
