        <text>While many bards actively pursue secret information and constantly seek obscure knowledge, a select few of them have dedicated themselves to making sure that some things stay hidden. According to them, knowledge and wisdom will come to you when you are ready, so you should focus on improving your mind and pondering deep questions more than searching for ancient tomes or lost libraries. While these talents are usually used to keep dangerous secrets and vile artifacts from becoming common knowledge, some can't help but also play tricks on others using their impressive mind-bending skills.

        <name>Secret Keeper (College of Riddling (HB))</name>
        <text>You are familiar with a ritual that allows you to keep secret and sacred things obscured from the attention of others until they have proven themselves worthy. Once per long rest, you can choose a Huge or smaller object that is within 5 feet of you and perform a 1 minute ritual. Creatures that willingly approach the object for the first time after the ritual is complete must make an Intelligence saving throw or forget what they were doing and why they were approaching the object. The object also becomes invisible to the creature, even if the creature would normally be able to see it; such as through blindsight or tremorsense. If the creature moves more than 10 feet away from the object, the creature must make another Intelligence saving throw or forget that the object exists entirely.
	The creature is not always initially aware that they have forgotten the object if it fails the second saving throw, and the creature's mind does not fill in any gaps that may be left in the creature's memory because of it. The creature may attempt the saving throw once per day to figure out why there are gaps in its memory if it becomes aware of such gaps, ending all effects of this feature concerning that object on itself on a success. Lesser restoration, remove curse, or similar magic will also restore the creature's memory, ending all effects of this feature concerning that object on the creature.
	The creature can rediscover the object, such as by having the object placed in their hands or listening to a familiar song played from it, and it has advantage on its saving throws against the effects of this feature concerning that object if it does. You and any creatures that you designate during the casting of this ritual can be immune to the effects of this feature concerning that object. You may affect a number of objects using this feature equal to your proficiency modifier, and you may end the effects of a ritual at any time, no action required.

        <name>Call Into Question (College of Riddling (HB))</name>
        <text>You have learned to pose questions to befuddle a creature. As a reaction in response to being affected by an attack or a spell, you may use bardic inspiration to pose a question to a creature within 30 feet of you that can hear you. If the target can understand you, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature's speed is reduced by half until the end of their next turn, and they have disadvantage on their next Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma check or saving throw.

        <name>All In Good Time (College of Riddling (HB))</name>
        <text>Wisdom has a tendency to come to you when you need it. By taking 1 minute to ponder on your needs and how to best fill them, you can perform a ritual that allows you to add a spell from any class with a spell level equal to or lower than your proficiency bonus to your known spells. The chosen spell counts as a bard spell for you but doesn't count against the number of bard spells you know. When you cast this spell, it disappears from your list of known spells. You cannot add a spell to your list of known spells in this way again until you finish a long rest.

        <name>Discombobulate (College of Riddling (HB))</name>
        <text>14th-level College of Riddling feature When a creature fails it's saving throw against your Call into Question feature, it is completely addled by the question you have asked. The creature may take an action or a bonus action on its next turn, but not both. Additionally, until after its turn is over, there is a 50% chance that the creature fails when it attempts to cast spells or activate magic items. The creature is snapped out of this muddle if it is attacked or damaged by a spell.
	Additionally, creatures who have failed a saving throw against your Secret Keeper feature have disadvantage on all saving throws against the ritual pertaining to that particular object.
