        <text>The Way of Momentum is taught by understanding the movements of the natural world and moving with them. Those who follow the Way of Momentum might do so to feel more in tune with nature and its patterns. They may be travelers deciding where to travel based on the wind, water, and the feel of nature, while others act as sages that read the flow of nature and offer advice to others.

        <name>Rolling Body (Way of the Momentum (HB))</name>
        <text>As a reaction when you are dealt bludgeoning, cold, fire, force, lightning, or thunder damage, you can spend 1 ki point to move with the flow of the attack and move up to 10 feet in any direction except for towards the source of the damage. You also gain resistance to the source of damage until the start of your next turn. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.
	Additionally, you can reduce the damage of melee attacks with your Deflect Missiles feature. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can make an unarmed strike against the attacker if they are within range.

        <name>Flowing Nature (Way of the Momentum (HB))</name>
        <text>11th-level Way of Momentum feature You gain the ability to move with the momentum of your environment, granting you the following benefits:

	• When you become submerged in water you gain a swim speed equal to your movement speed until you are out of water. You cannot, however, move against the flow of water. For example, you cannot swim up a waterfall.

	• You are considered to be under the effects of a freedom of movement spell anytime you have all of your hit points. If your current hit points are lower than your maximum hit points, you can spend 2 ki points to regain this benefit until you take damage.

	• You can spend 2 ki points to gain a flying speed equal to your current walking speed. This speed only lasts for 1 minute or until you stop moving. Whichever comes first...
