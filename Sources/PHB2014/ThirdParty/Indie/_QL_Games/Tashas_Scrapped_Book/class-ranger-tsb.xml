        <text>A group that specializes in maintaining harmony and turning away creatures that have proven to be incongruous with the harmony that they stand for, these rangers are often medicine men and women, gurus, and occasionally even prophets and oracles. While they are generally peaceful, they can be awesome opponents when protecting the places and the people that they love.

        <text>Shamanistic Practitioner Magic You learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Shamanistic Practitioners Spells table. Each spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.
	You can also cast any ranger spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.

Shamanistic Practitioner Spells:
Level | Spells
3rd | sanctuary
5th | augury
9th | remove curse
13th | divination
17th | banishment

        <name>All Are One (Shamanistic Practitioner (HB))</name>
        <text>You can harmonize the life force of those around you, as well as harness the energy of the nearby nature. By forming a circle with other creatures and meditating with them for 10 minutes, you can perform a ritual to cast telepathic bond or find familiar. Either result requires concentration, and the effects last up to a number of minutes equal to your 10 times your proficiency bonus. Once you perform this ritual, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

        <name>Boundary (Shamanistic Practitioner (HB))</name>
        <text>As a bonus action, you can choose a creature within 30 feet of you. Each time that creature damages you, successfully effects you with a spell, or reduces a creature to 0 hit points on its next turn, you can deal force damage to it equal to half your Wisdom modifier, rounded up (minimum of 1).

        <name>Keen and Wise (Shamanistic Practitioner (HB))</name>
        <text>When a creature misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to read their energy. Reading their energy does not tell you any specifics about the creature, but helps you to understand their intentions well enough for you to avoid attacks and effects proceeding from them. The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the beginning of their next turn, and you have advantage on saving throws from effects created by them until the end of your next turn.
