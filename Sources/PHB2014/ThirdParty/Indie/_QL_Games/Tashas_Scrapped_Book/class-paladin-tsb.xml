        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Chivalry (HB)</name>
        <text>Paladins who swear the oath of chivalry are stalwart defenders of the innocent and weak, standing between them and those who would do them harm through dark magic and deceit. Chivalric paladins are known to venture into darkness in order to light the way for others, and to seek out those who spread the darkness and vanquish them

Tenets of Chivalry:
The Oath of Chivalry has appeared throughout history in many forms, its exact wording shifting from era to era, but in essence paladins of this oath share these tenets.

Truth. Above all, be true to your word and oppose deceit and trickery.

Selflessness. Champion the weak, and serve them before your own needs.

Justice. Seek out and punish those who break their oaths or harm the innocent.

Integrity. Set yourself as an example to others, acting with honor and forthrightness.

Oath Spells:
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels in the Oath of Chivalry Spells table. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how oath spells work.

3rd | compelled duel, healing word

        <name>Channel Divinity: Shining Beacon (Oath of Chivalry (HB))</name>
        <text>As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to begin shining with the light of truth for as long as you concentrate (as though concentrating on a spell) for up to 1 minute. For this duration, you shed bright light in a 10-foot radius, and dim light 10 feet beyond that. When a creature that starts its turn within this light, or enters it for the first time during a turn, it must make a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by it. Affected creatures are outlined in shining light, revealing their true forms if they are magically disguised, and gain no benefit from being invisible.
	Additionally, affected creatures cannot speak lies, though they are under no compulsion to reveal truths they wish to remain secret. When your concentration ends, affected creatures are no longer affected.

        <text>You are vigilant against the magical trickery of your foes.
