        <name>Otherworldly Patron: The Wicked One (HB)</name>
        <text>Throughout history, mages have made an impact on the world. Some of these individuals have carved their names in legend and possess a legacy that stands the test of time. Mages such as Mordenkainen, Elminster, and Tasha. Many of these mages have steered the course of history...and those of ill repute or intent are often given titles like "diabolist", "cultist", or "witch".
	For whatever reason, you have drawn the attention of one such figure, who's past and true name have been shrouded in wicked mystique. Under the guise of an old crone, a smiling fiend, or the mantle of a dark fey, the Wicked One has bestowed upon you occult powers, and only time can reveal what inscrutable plans they have in store for you.

        <name>Bonus Cantrip (The Wicked One (HB))</name>

        <name>Malocchio (The Wicked One (HB))</name>
        <text>You gain the ability to lay a curse of misfortune on another creature with but a glare. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target dies, you die, you are incapacitated, or if you use this ability to curse another creature. Until the curse ends, the target suffers the following effects:

	• All damage the target's attacks deal is reduced by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus, to a minimum of 1 damage.

	• The target has disadvantage on the first d20 roll it makes since the start of its turn each round, whether that roll is an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.

	• The target cannot take reactions.

        <name>Occult Flight (The Wicked One (HB))</name>
        <text>You learn the spell fly. It counts as a warlock spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of spells you know. You can also cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
	Additionally, when you cast fly, you may add a material component of a broom, a quarterstaff, or a long tree branch. If you do, the spell's duration does not require concentration, but the spell also gains no benefit from being cast at a level higher than 3rd and it ends immediately if you no longer hold the additional material component with at least one hand.

        <name>Baleful Polymorph (The Wicked One (HB))</name>
        <text>You learn the spell polymorph. It counts as a warlock spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of spells you know. You can also cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
	Additionally, if you cast polymorph on a target that is already cursed by you, the spell's duration becomes permanent. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points while affected by a permanent polymorph spell, it must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a success, the spell ends as normal for the polymorph spell, with the target taking any remaining damage to its true form's hit points. On a failure, the target returns to its true form at 0 hit points and begins dying.
