        <text>Also known as the wizards of wonder and the experimental experts, these wizards specialize in always having something new and different up their sleeves. Some specialize in hiding poison beneath their robes, while others may opt for wearing armor instead of robes. Still others may prove to be versatile healers, magical explorers, or maybe just wizards who continually awe and amaze.

        <text>You gain three proficiencies. If at least one of these proficiencies is a skill, choose one skill that you are proficient in. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses the chosen skill. Whenever you gain a level in wizard, you can choose a current proficiency and exchange it for another. You may also change which proficient skill you have that your proficiency bonus is doubled for.

        <name>Unexpected Results (School of Surprises (HB))</name>
        <text>When you cast a spell, you can use the components of a different spell instead of the components for the spell that you are casting-so long as the number of components and the cost for the components do not decrease.
	For example, you can cast blur by using somatic components instead of vocal ones, counterspell by using vocal components instead of somatic ones, or dimension door by using a material component instead of vocal components, provided that you are able to cast those spells in the first place.
	You must still use a spell slot, take the necessary time, and fill any other requirements as normal.

        <name>Unusual Magics (School of Surprises (HB))</name>
        <text>You add a number of spells equal to your Intelligence modifier, from any class list, to your spellbook. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, or a cantrip. If your intelligence modifier increases, you can follow these same guidelines to add a number of spells equal to the increase in your Intelligence modifier.
	Additionally, when you gain a level of wizard that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, one of the two chosen spells you add to your spellbook can be from a different class spell list.

        <text>As a bonus action, you can expend a spell slot to exchange some of your prepared spells. The combined level of the new spells cannot surpass the level of the spell slot expended to swap them.
	For example, if you expend a 4th-level spell slot, you can switch up to four 1st-level spells for four different 1st-level spells. Alternatively, you could replace up to two 2nd-level spells, or a 1st-level spell and a 3rd-level spell.
	This does not increase the number of spells you can have prepared, only which spells you currently have prepared.

        <name>Master of Surprise (School of Surprises (HB))</name>
        <text>You've mastered the element of surprise. When you damage a creature or effect it with a spell, and you had advantage on your spell attack or the target had disadvantage on the spell's saving throw, you can force the target to make an additional Wisdom saving throw.
	On a failure, the creature is surprised (as described in chapter 9 of the Players Handbook) even if it is not the first round of combat. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all uses at the end of a long rest. Targeting multiple creatures with this effect requires using multiple uses.
