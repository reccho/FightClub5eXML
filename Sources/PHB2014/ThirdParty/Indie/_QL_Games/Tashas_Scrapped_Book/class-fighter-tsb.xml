        <name>Martial Archetype: Fey Knight (HB)</name>
        <text>The feywild is a realm close to the world of mortals, and sometimes the veil between them parts. During these times, travelers can find themselves wandering through the lush, vibrant lands of the fey without realizing they have left their mundane world behind. Sometimes, these mortals find themselves the objects of curiosity, desire, or affection of the fey.
	Most of these mortals become the unfortunate pawns of fey caprice, but fey knights are those who have had their potential as more than mere toys recognized. Such champions have gained the benediction of a powerful archfey ally, granting them magical abilities above and beyond their martial prowess.

        <name>Fey Power (Fey Knight (HB))</name>
        <text>You have been bestowed with a wellspring of fey magic by a powerful fey benefactor, augmenting your mortal prowess. You may call on this wellspring a number of times equal to twice your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. When you call on your fey power as a bonus action, you can produce one of several effects. If an effect allows a saving throw to resist it, the difficulty class of the saving throw is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier.
	When you call on your fey power, choose one of the following effects:

Fairy Dust. You cast the levitate spell, requiring no components. If the target of the spell is an unwilling creature, its saving throw is made with advantage. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

Fey Step. You cast the misty step spell, requiring no components. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

Beguiling Charm. You target one creature you can see and force them to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is magically charmed by you for 1 minute. If you make an attack against the creature within that time, you have advantage on the attack roll, and then the effect ends. When this effect ends, the creature realizes you have magically charmed them. A creature who succeeds on their saving throw against this effect, or a creature upon whom the effect has ended, is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

Phantasmal Strike. You channel fey power into your attacks. The next attack that hits a creature before the end of your turn deals an additional d8 psychic damage and the creature cannot take reactions until the end of your next turn.

        <name>Endure Caprice (Fey Knight (HB))</name>
        <text>Unlike lesser mortals who have crossed paths with the fey, you were chosen to be an archfey's champion partly for your ability to weather their capricious whims and tricks. You are immune to effects that would magically age you and have resistance to psychic damage.
	Additionally, starting at 9th level, when you use your Indomitable feature to reroll a failed Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw against a magical effect, you automatically succeed on the reroll.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Greater Fey Power (Fey Knight (HB))</name>
        <text>You become able to harness more of the power bestowed upon you by your archfey benefactor. Whenever you finish a short rest, you regain a number of uses of fey power equal to half your proficiency bonus.
	Additionally, by spending 2 uses of fey power when you call on it, you can produce one of the following greater effects:

Enchanted Slumber. You target one creature you can see within 30 feet and attempt to draw them into an ageless sleep. If the target's nature is that of a creature that sleeps, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is restrained as it becomes incredibly drowsy. On a successful save, the creature isn't affected.
	A creature restrained by this effect must make another Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this effect three times, the effect ends. If it fails its save three times, it becomes cursed and falls unconscious indefinitely. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive;
keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind The cursed creature does not require food or drink, and ceases to age. While cursed, the creature cannot be awoken by normal means. If the creature takes at least 10 damage from a single attack or effect, the curse ends and it awakens.

Mirage Step. You cast the mislead spell as a bonus action, but the spell ends at the end of your turn.

Illusory Barrage. As a bonus action, you project an illusion over yourself of you making a flurry of attacks with your weapon. As part of this bonus action, make one weapon attack with advantage against a target within reach. If the attack hits, it deals an extra 3d8 damage and all damage the attack deals is psychic damage. Additionally, the target of the attack must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, illusions only the target can see distract it and it has disadvantage on the next attack it makes before the end of its next turn.

        <name>Parter of Veils (Fey Knight (HB))</name>
        <text>You are bestowed by your benefactor with the privilege of parting the veil between times, places, and people. You may cast legend lore, plane shift, scry, or sending without any material components. You may use this feature to cast a spell once, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

        <name>Summon Benefactor's Masque (Fey Knight (HB))</name>
        <text>You gain the ability to call on an aspect of your archfey benefactor, summoning one of their masques to your side. By spending at least three uses of fey power, you can cast the summon fey spell (see appendix a), requiring no material components. The number of uses of fey power you spend equals the level of the spell when you cast it, up to a maximum of 9 uses. You may only cast this spell this way once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
	When you cast summon fey this way, the spell has a duration of 8 hours and does not require concentration, although the spell ends if you are knocked unconscious. Additionally, the fey spirit summoned can be Medium or Large, and it can have any alignment.
