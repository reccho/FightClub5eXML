    <text>Damage from this sword is psychic damage instead of the weapon's usual damage type. A creature damaged by this sword must make a DC 12 wisdom saving throw or suffer 1 random type of short term madness until the end of the target's next turn.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Proficiency: martial, greatsword
