        <text>The mind is a deep place, where enlightenment grows and confusion festers. There is a fine line between genius and insanity, and clerics of this domain specialize in both understanding and walking this line. While total submission to the senseless void of the mind is taboo in many places, most cultures also recognize the need for free flowing, intuitive, spontaneous aspects of life. Many cultures respect and even revere the formless chaos within, from which all ideas are birthed.

        <name>Channel Divinity: Mental Verge (Mental Domain (HB))</name>
        <text>You can use your Channel Divinity to direct the sanity of a creature.
	As an action, you present your holy symbol and force one creature within 60 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you can affect the creature in one of the following ways:

Delusion. You inflict one random kind of indefinite madness.

Delirium. You inflict one random kind of long term madness.

Craze. You inflict one random kind of short term madness for 1d4 rounds.

Relief. You remove one kind of madness from the creature.

Other options may also be available, at your DM's discretion. If the effects are not apparent, the creature may not initially realize that anything has happened.
	Additionally, a creature may willingly fail the saving throw if it chooses to do so. If it does, you may select the specific kind of madness that is inflicted or removed.
