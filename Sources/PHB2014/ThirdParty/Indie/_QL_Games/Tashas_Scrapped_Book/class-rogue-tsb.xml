        <name>Tricks of the Trade (Puzzler (HB))</name>
        <text>You are good at finding, infiltrating, and taking advantage of hidden groups. You have advantage on checks to find discreet codes and signs, such as passwords, warnings to guild members of traps and hazards, secrets within maps pointing to where the actual treasure is, codes on door signs, subtle gestures made in public that signal a hidden brotherhood, and other insightful tidbits. You also have advantage on checks made to pass yourself off as someone else.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Trinket Touch (Puzzler (HB))</name>
        <text>You can use a bonus action to set a trinket (by planting it on a creature or object within 5 feet of you) that can be triggered by using a later bonus action. If you are planting the trinket on an unwilling creature, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the Wisdom (Perception) of the creature. If you win, you successfully plant the trinket. The trinket deals 1d4 piercing damage on a hit when triggered, can benefit from your Sneak Attack, can be coated with a potion, poison, etc. and can either target a creature it is planted on or a target within 10 feet of it. The trinket uses your attack bonuses, and if the trinket is planted on the target of the attack, it has advantage on the attack roll. Once the trinket is triggered, it must be reset before it can be triggered again. You can have a number of trinkets waiting to be triggered equal to your Intelligence modifier.

Trinkets:
Puzzler rogues use trinkets to mark their enemies, initiate poisons, and even make mechanical weapons. For inventory purposes, a trinket can be one of the trinkets noted at the end of chapter 5 in the Player's Handbook, or any piece of equipment costing at least 1 gp-such as ball bearings or caltrops. The DM may rule that a trinket must contain certain materials in order to produce specific results; metal for shrapnel bombs, for example.

        <name>Surprises (Puzzler (HB))</name>
        <text>You are a connoisseur of methods used to befuddle and bamboozle. You gain the following benefits:

	• You are proficient with alchemist's supplies and tinkerer's tools.

	• You have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks made to plant objects on a target, as well as to take items that are not attached to the target such as jewelry, clothing accessories, belts, etc.

	• Using a trinket, you can create a Tiny container, spring-loaded with a hermetic seal, filled with concoctions that react when struck hard against an object. You know three types of concoctions: salt acid (dried hydrochloric acid, which behaves the same as regular acid except that it is a powder), liquid fire (white phosphorus separated within the capsule from water that bursts open on impact and behaves the same as alchemist's fire), and solid smoke: a slightly larger capsule that explodes in a 10 foot sphere of harmless thick smoke that makes the affected area heavily obscured.

        <name>Master of Mischief (Puzzler (HB))</name>
        <text>You continue to learn and apply methods. You gain the following benefits:

	• You can move your expertise from two of your skill proficiencies, or your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves' tools, to your proficiency with alchemist's supplies and/or tinkerer's tools.

	• You can gain advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks made to take items attached to a target (stealing a ring off of a finger, a necklace off of the neck, etc.) by taking 1 minute to study the target. The minimum time required for the target to realize the item's absence is a number of rounds equal to the difference between your Sleight of Hand and the target's Perception.

	• By taking 10 minutes and using at least two trinkets, you can create a larger, more powerful invention the timed bomb. The saving throw DC for a bomb is equal to 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus. You know how to build three types: metal shrapnel bombs (when it goes off, creatures within 30 feet of the bomb must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. Creatures take piercing damage equal to your Sneak Attack damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one) blinding powder bombs that irritate the eyes (when it goes off, creatures within 10 feet of the bomb must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1d4 rounds), and a concussive blast mixture bomb (when it goes off, creatures within 20 feet of the bomb must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take force damage equal to half of your Sneak Attack damage and become deafened for 1 round).

        <name>Shocking Retaliation (Puzzler (HB))</name>
        <text>You have perfected the art of taking others by surprise, especially when they think that they are in control. When a creature hits you with a melee attack, but before they deal damage, you can use your reaction to make an attack against them. This attack automatically benefits from your Sneak Attack if you hit, unless the attack roll was made at disadvantage. Remember that you can deal Sneak Attack damage once per turn, and that this attack will likely occur during a different creature's turn.
