        <text>Some druids align themselves with the symbiotic relationship of both the mundane and the supernatural. Such druids discover that magical forms impossible for most druids come to them easily, and that the forest itself comes alive and may even rush to their aid, often in mystifying and wondrous ways.

        <name>Beings of the Forest (Circle of the Enchanted Forest (HB))</name>
        <text>2nd-level Circle of the Enchanted Forest feature You can use an action to touch a plant or a beast and grant it magical sentience. The target must meet the requirements for the awaken spell, and is affected as if by an awaken spell-with the exception that it is not charmed by you-for as long as this magical sentience lasts. This sentience lasts for as long as you maintain concentration (as if concentrating on a spell) up to a number of hours equal to your druid level minus the Challenge Rating of the creature. Your GM chooses statistics appropriate for an awakened plant, such as the statistics for the awakened shrub or the awakened tree. Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

        <text>You can use your action to draw from otherworldly planes to summon mystical illusions. This illusion functions as an illusory dragon, except that you can choose where to draw the energy from, and it appears in any form you wish-though it must be Huge or smaller. You may only have one such mystical illusion at a time. Additionally, the illusion's blast of energy deals damage equal to a number of d4s equal to your proficiency bonus instead of its usual damage, and a creature takes no damage if they succeed on the saving throw against its breath.

        <text>You can expend two uses of Wild Shape at the same time to transform into a dragon or a giant with a challenge rating as high as your druid level divided by 3, rounded down. You do not gain any lair actions or regional effects from this Wild Shape.

        <name>Immutable Mind And Body (Circle of the Enchanted Forest (HB))</name>
        <text>Your connection to the enchanted nature of magical places grants you a certain level of mystical resilience. You are immune to being charmed and frightened, and magic cannot put you to sleep or knock you unconscious unless it reduces your hit points to 0. You also have advantage on saving throws against effects that would change your form, such as flesh to stone and polymorph.
