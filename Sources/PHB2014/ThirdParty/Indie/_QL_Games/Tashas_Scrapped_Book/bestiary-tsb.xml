    <description>Fey nobles attend both courts. They are the primary players in the convoluted politics of both courts. Mortals find them beautiful, and they find mortals to be useful tools. Nearly every noble belongs to a clan, usually bound by blood. These clans form the basis of fey society and are always beholden to at least one fey lord. Marriages between different clans are supposed to create new alliances, but mostly just cause more chaos.

    <description>Fey consorts are neither combat veterans or skilled assassins, but they are some of the most dangerous members of either fey court. They are skilled manipulators and spies. They excel at gathering information and spotting corrupt individuals they can manipulate into giving the fey consorts what they want.
	Fey consorts avoid combat whenever possible, leaving that for the more boorish members of the court. Fey consorts are almost perversely fond of mortals, who are easy to manipulate.

    <description>The Unseelie Court is the home of the dark hunt. The dark hunt is a collection of fey and unique creatures that the Queen of Air and Darkness unleashes on anyone foolish enough to displease her, anger her, or if she's bored. The dark hunt gleefully seeks out its prey. Prizes and honor will be showered on the fey that kills the target of the hunt. Particularly painful or artistic kills will be given even greater honor. Competition amongst the dark hunt is extremely high, and most fey consider the race back to the Unseelie Court to deliver the target's head to be the most exciting part.

      <text>Baba Yaga is one of the oldest beings in the multiverse. She was there when magic came into being and has studied its deepest secrets ever since. Baba Yaga knows every spell and can cast them at any time. She must expend spell slots as normal. Baba Yaga may cast any cantrip at will. She has four spell slots apiece for first through third level. She has three spell slots for each level from fourth through sixth. She has two spell slots for each level from seven to nine. Charisma is her usual spellcasting ability (spell save DC 27, +19 to hit with spell attacks) but she does know secrets of magic that allow her to use others. Baba Yaga's spells cannot be countered, but they can be blocked. For example, counterspell and dispel magic automatically fail, but shield and wall of force may still prove effective.</text>

Each of these knights will come to her aid if summoned, arriving by teleportation the round after she calls. These knights are death knights. In addition to the knights, Baba Yaga is also accompanied by her hound (a hell hound) and her cat (a displacer beast). Twenty skulls line the fence around her hut, and Baba Yaga can call all of the skulls at once. Treat the skulls as flameskulls which appear in any empty space within 300 feet of Baba Yaga the round after she calls.

    <description>The Seelie and Unseelie courts are the political power of the Feywild. But while many of the creatures that live in the plane look to them for leadership, they are not the oldest nor the most powerful beings in the Feywild.
	Baba Yaga is an ancient witch that has been called the mother of hags, the first night hag, the first witch and a thousand other titles besides. She is a wizened figure barely five feet tall, although severely hunched. Her hands are tipped with iron claws, and despite her appearance, she is devastatingly fast. Her eyes are black as coal, and when she smiles it is apparent that her teeth are made of sharpened stones. Baba Yaga smiles a lot.
	Baba Yaga is a mysterious figure within the Feywild. Sometimes helpful, and sometimes a cataclysmic force of nature. She does what she wishes when she wishes and very few creatures have the power to stop her.

    <description>The jabberwocky is an enigma. It appears near either court seemingly at random, and sages among the fey listen to its constant burbling, trying to ascertain any meaning or portent in the insanity.
	The jabberwocky is a massive dragon shaped creature nearly thirty feet in length. It is a gangly mishmash of limbs, with a head far too large for its neck. Its eyes constantly wander, never looking at anything for very long and its heavy jaws constantly move. The jabberwocky has small wings that are barely able to lift its massive body off the ground.
	Little is known about the history of the jabberwocky. Some sages think it to be a type of dragon, and others a mutilated fiend or celestial. No one really knows. Sages even argue if there is one jabberwocky or if it is a species of dragon native to the Feywild. The only sure thing is that the jabberwocky isn't telling anyone.

    <description>These fiendish creatures resemble hairless pale-white dogs but with elongated legs. Being experts at following magical trails left behind by arcane uses, they are frequently used by both bounty hunters to track down unlawful mages and by Devils who are looking for someone to enslave. Once one of these creatures mark a target, they will stop at almost nothing until they catch their quarry.
