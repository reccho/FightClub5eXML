        <text>Known by many to be the combination of harmony and dissonance, paired with magic and science, luthier artificers craft instruments for themselves that pulse with reverberating force that vibrates nearby creatures and objects to their very core. They use these powerful instruments to embolden their allies, distract their enemies, and invoke magic.

        <name>Arcane Instrument (Luthier Artificer (HB))</name>
        <text>You can use your woodcarver's tools and 10 gp worth of materials to create a stringed instrument of your choosing as part of a long rest. This is your Arcane Instrument.
	As a bonus action you can play a tune on your Arcane Instrument that distracts a foe. Choose one creature within 60 feet, that creature takes 1d6 Thunder damage and has disadvantage on their next attack roll. If that creature must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, you can subtract 1d6 from the result.
