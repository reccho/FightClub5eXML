    <description>An arcane ooze is a black pudding, magically enhanced by dwarven arcanists, which appears as a huge pile of oily, purple-black slime. These oozes are incredibly docile, often only attacking at the specific command of their creator. Some powerful dwarven mages can imbue commands within the ooze which last centuries, despite their complete lack of intelligence. Because of this, arcane oozes are often deployed as guards for treasure.

Treasure Protectors. Arcane oozes are most frequently encountered outside treasure hoards or other rooms that require long-term protection. Unlike other guard creatures, these oozes can persist for centuries with very little sustenance. Not only this, the oozes can slide through cracks in walls and floors, patrolling corridors and stairwells that other creatures would be incapable of.

Spell Turning. After much experimentation, dwarves finally managed to imbue a black pudding with a spell reflecting effect. This was achieved by feeding black puddings dozens of rings of spell turning. Eventually, the oozes absorbed the effect from these magic rings. Now, should a spell be cast against these oozes, there is a chance that the curse will be reflected straight back against the caster.

Highly Flammable. One of the oozes biggest flaws, which remained unnoticed by its dwarven creators, is that it is incredibly likely to catch fire. Although the ooze itself resists the damage, they can catch alight from the smallest spark, turning a corridor decorated with tapestries and rugs to a smoldering waste in a matter of moments. This feature has been exploited by canny adventurers, who set them alight from afar to cause distractions.

2. Slowing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>

    <description>The Eye of the Deep is an offshoot of the beholder race spawned in the deepest chasms of the Plane of Water by some malevolent intelligence. It appears as a spherical crustacean, roughly eight feet across, with thick chitinous plates covering its bulk. A single central eye sits in its center from which it can emit a blinding light, particularly effective in the shadows of the Darkened Depths. It possesses two large pincers and a mouth full of crooked, razor-sharp teeth, which it uses to rend flesh from blinded or stunned opponents. Unlike a normal beholder, it only has two eye stalks, but both are tuned to help it hunt in the deep waters.

Solitary Hunters: Eyes of the Deep lurk in the aquatic depths of the Plane of Water, stalking prey for days on end when necessary. Like all beholders, they are xenophobic and each believes they are the pinnacle of beholder perfection. The darkness of their territory drives them to solitude, so rarely are they ever encountered with minions.

Shiny Objects: If an Eye of the Deep has one key weakness, it is for shiny objects. Their lairs are often decorated with the pilfered treasures of their past meals, but only if they reflect their blinding light. Mirrors are prized above all else - they are shiny and they let the eye of the deep admire their own perfect form.

    <description>Unlike its smaller skeleton cousins, the Bone Giant - the animated bones of a Hill Giant - was not originally created using dark magic. Ulrich, the dwarven cleric of Lathandar, created the giant to guard a powerful magic item against evil forces.

Lumbering Hulk. The Bone Giant is a slow, yet powerful animation. Those who battle a Bone Giant had better keep their distance or risk being pummeled by a massive bone club.

Grand Guardians. Due to their slow speed, Bone Giants are typically only used in dungeons or as guardians. They don't make for good group troops seeing as how most other creatures walk three times faster than the white hulks. However, they do make practical guards in castles and other structures where movement is limited.

    <description>The colossus is a weapon of elemental destruction created by the proto-gods in a bid for power over a realm where magic flowed raw, unbridled, and unchecked. Standing nearly forty feet tall when on its feet, the colossus dwarfs modern-day giants and is rivaled only by the sheer size of the tarrasque. The bipedal tower has a natural armor that resembles a mountainous landscape and gives off its own magnetic aura. As the gods settled into their portfolios, the need for these beings passed and they soon fell into obscurity. This bound specimen may very well be the last one in existence.

Forgotten Master. Although it is not clear why the colossus is bound to its location, tomes of old purport of a malicious wizard who may be the cause. Ancient scribes sought to omit his name, letting it fade into the annals of history, but do tell of a unique gemstone created through what must be a powerful variant of the imprisonment spell. Nicknamed "Maximilian" by the unlikeable master, the colossus served him as it did thegods; as a weapon. When the time came for the wizard to pass on, it was thought best for the realm if the weapon was put to rest alongside him.

Earthen Grasp. Spellcasters that know the spell Maximilian's Earthen Grasp regularly pay homage to this being, though not in the way they would expect. As the books tell, Maximilian was not pleased to be the puppet of a mere wizard and often attempted to reach out for the gemstone that kept the elemental in its prison. Though it seems unlikely, the legends state that the hand that bursts forth as a result of the casting of this spell is actually the hand of Maximilian, still in search of that gemstone. As the creator of Maximilian's Earthen Grasp, that was the wizard's legacy, the eternal taunting of a planar weapon. How foolish...

    <description>A Kaolahr, or Demon Blight, can blame its existence on druids with evil intent. Usually, these horrendous fiends are summoned during a ritual which combines the hatred for lush green forests, several blood sacrifices and the power from the roots of a Gulthias Tree. These creatures are then put to work protecting the Gulthias Tree's supplicant army as it spreads its evil across the land.

Twisted Limbs. Demon Blights move in an almost bi-pedal fashion, it's long branch-like arms and fists pushing and pulling it along with its trunk like legs. When hunched over the Demon Blight is approximately 6ft. in height, but when it stands tall and fully extends its body, it is more like 9 ft. Its appearance is very much a mass of animated branches, twigs and vines with pseudo wings and long twisting horns on its forehead.

Silent Killers. It does not speak, but it makes a clacking sound, which speeds up as it coils up ready to attack. This sound can be perceived on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check, but its source cannot be determined, especially if a Kaolahr is motionless in large shrubs.

    <description>Eelfolk are a piscine race with rubbery skin and patterned coloration meant to provide camouflage amid shifting underwater light. They slink and hunt through caves and shoals, carving out territory in bursts of aggressive expansion. Eelfolk often lair along shorelines and submerged caverns, never too far from the surface where they must occasionally gulp great mouthfuls of air.

Ambushers. Eelfolk keep to the fringes of the sea and ambush any who encroach upon their territory. While hunting, they prefer to lie in wait for prey to draw close before lunging out to attack. Two pouches behind their necks generate an electrical charge they use to sense their quarry, even in the murkiest depths.

Storm Worshippers. Eelfolk worship the squalls of the sea as though they were gods, viewing all storms as divinely inspired. Sailors at sea have reported seeing dozens of eelfolk cavorting through the water during tempests.

Growing Pains. Eelfolk grow larger and more powerful with age, shifting from stealthy hunters to vicious brutes. Fully matured eelfolk grow extra electrical pouches that cover their bodies in crackling energy. These scourges are more cunning and aggressive than their younger brethren. They lead surprise raids along shoreline settlements in order to satiate their ever-growing hunger for violence and food.

Storm's Fury. During raging ocean storms, the strongest and most cunning eelfolk fight with each other to throw themselves in the path of a lightning strike. Rarely, one lucky creature will be enveloped in a great blast of energy. The lighting burns the eelfolk's bulky body away, replacing it with a gaunt form housing magnificent power. These eelfolk stormcallers gain the ability to channel the tempest's might, summoning lightning bolts and gales of wind to pummel their foes.

    <description>Legends describe Dareu, the Queen of Forests, as awe-inspiring, possessing such beauty that weak beings go blind from beholding her countenance. A popular legend tells the story of her mercy and gratitude, and how she gives back sight to loyal pilgrims who travel to her oak castle just to see her. Queen Dareu is often seen visiting the Material Plane in the form of a grand white unicorn. She travels the lands healing wounded beasts and sometimes the lesser races with her healing powers.

Queen Dareu crafted a powerful artifact eons before elves roamed the land; a mighty goblet that she infused with the life-force of a dying Archfey just like herself. This was the Queen of Bees and Insects, Anaralla. She perished from her wounds in one of the Feywild wars, with her spirit and might preserved in a new form, inside a magical goblet. The Goblet of Fireflies is the only way to create a firefly golem.

A firefly golem is not a construct or even solid. They are actually swarms of fireflies with the gift of sentience. Each insect is nothing but an appendage while the swarm is intelligent and sentient. The firefly golem is usually dispersed and only coalesces into golem form when it needs to perform its creator's will. Queen Dareu created hundreds of firefly golems and gave them tasks. Most of them serve their queen as guardians and protectors. A few have been stolen and repurposed for other nefarious things.

Swarm Density. When a swarm of fireflies gets together to form the firefly golem, the insects are so tightly packed that they form a full physical being. The firefly golem's abilities and attacks are only available to it once it takes physical form.

Insect Intelligence. Firefly golems are somewhat intelligent but are unable to abandon their insect-like nature. The only language they understand is sylvan, but they cannot speak it.

Territorial Nature. Firefly golems are fearsome protectors. The area they guard is their sole priority. It is not apparent to the observer that the place is closely guarded because the fireflies are dispersed, but as soon as a threat arises, the firefly golem condenses into physical form and attacks.

    <description>Gulabuses are repulsive creatures who look like morbidly obese humans with deformed facial traits. They mostly live in the Abyss but are occasionally encountered in the rest of the Lower Planes. They only come to the Material Plane when summoned, and most of the time, nobody ever knows they were there.

Masters of Rituals. Gulabuses, also known as demons of gluttony, use succulent dishes and fine drinks to corrupt the souls of sentient humanoids. They're masters of ritual magic and know how to make demonic food and beverages which gives them control over the people who consume them. Every gulabus has its own tricks so feel free to make up your own. If the demon is corrupting people with tainted cookies or wine, you're doing it right!

Secretive and Deceitful. Demons of gluttony prefer to stay out of sight and act from the shadows. A gulabus typically infiltrates a small community without anyone noticing it, corrupts a handful of people to act as its proxies, and then spread its influence to the entire village. By the time the local authorities realize what's going on, it's usually too late and the gulabus has an army of peasants to protect it. Because the demon of gluttony uses food and drinks to control people, anyone is a potential threat. Even an old lady selling cookies to buy her medicine might, in fact, be a gulabus's agent spreading its corruption.

    <description>In the deepest, wildest jungles of the world, fearful tales surround creatures who let no man or beast survive their presence.

Otherworldly Beings. Known only as Jungle Walkers, these alien entities are marked by the unearthly chiming that resounds throughout the area as they move. The few who have actually seen these creatures and lived to tell about it describe not a creature that walks, but one that hovers strangely over the ground. The hunched, oval-shaped thing is covered in an insect's chitinous plates and sets of dark, glassy eyes gleam with a hungering intelligence. No mouth or mandible is visible; only wet tendrils that sway and search from below those dark eyes.

Tropical Terrors. Those that overhear such stories scoff, remarking that these creatures are only the stuff of legend. But on the rare and dark nights when the chimes can be heard, these brave doubters still douse their fires and pray that it stays away.

    <description>Kennings are known as protectors of sylvan forests. They are giant ravens that communicate with each other using their own language.

Giant Aerial Protectors. These creatures are similar to giant eagles in size. They understand but cannot speak Common and Sylvan. They usually patrol the treetops at the fringes of sylvan forests looking for trespassers.

Flocking Birds. If intruders are caught defiling a protected forest, kennings will band together and attack as a flock. They will also send one or more of their number to alert local druids or elves to perceived threats.

    <description>The Mind Flayer Cenomorph represents the stage in an Illithid's life while it is in mid-metamorphosis from its initial humanoid form to that of an adult Mind Flayer. These wretches still retain some of the physical traits of their previous species, giving them a wholly disturbing and foul appearance. Their flesh is twisted and stretched as juvenile tentacles emerge from their faces. Their skin is moist and runny, in places sloughing off on a sheet of mucus, with the gray, lumpy skin of the illithid emerging from beneath.

Agony and Confusion. The Mind Flayer Cenomorph is in the process of a transformation that is both physical and mental in nature. As such, the Cenomorph spends much of its time confused and enraged. Much of the time, the adult Mind Flayers of the colony will leave the Cenomorphs in isolation as the last vestiges of their humanoid life fade into madness and change. However, if the Cenomorphs are needed for some purpose, the adult Illithids will calm them psionically. The transformation is incredibly painful for the Cenomorph, so much so that some do not survive the process.

    <description>No matter the difference in honor between chromatic and metallic dragons, one would be hard-pressed to argue that they aren't noble creatures. The inverse is true of the Ooze Dragon; a being so strange that not even the ever-changing layers of Limbo could spit it out. Only one ooze dragon is known to exist, born as an experiment of a crazed alchemist who sought to create a weapon so powerful none could oppose them. Over years of work and arcane horrors, a wyrmlings flesh and blood was warped to become translucent and gelatinous. The dragon was driven mad by this process, however, eventually killing its creator and escaping into the wild.

Digestive Tactics. Those few who claim to have met with the Ooze Dragon, and lived to tell the tell the tale, usually do not come back whole. Due to its amorphous body, the ooze dragon can absorb creatures and eat away at their flesh with its caustic ichor, melting those who cannot escape within minutes. Trails of half-digested flora and fauna can be found in the wake of the dragon and entire skeletons are commonly found here too.

Terrible Reminder. The body of the ooze dragon is entirely molded out of a translucent blue gel that loosely grips the last remaining elements of a vestigial skeleton. An entire skull is present but missing its bottom jaw, its spine and ribcage float aimlessly in its malformed torso and the claws in its feet remain. Empty eye sockets peer out of the skull but it is clear the creature can still see. In the center of the beast, a large heart has ceased beating and crystallized into a deep red gem that glistens in the light.

Without Purpose. None are sure what the ooze dragon wants, but most agree that neither does the dragon itself. It takes nopermanent lair, does not attempt to communicate with other dragons and seems to have no interest in collecting treasure or relics of importance. It ignores humanoids when it can and swiftly deals with any threats without attempting diplomacy. Most regard it as a force of nature now and simply try to stay out of its way, but others have noticed from its pattern of movement that it seems to be searching for something; no one knows quite what.

On a failed save, a creature takes 9 (2d8) thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the storm hound. On a successful save, a target takes half damage and isn't pushed.

In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area are automatically pushed 10 feet away from the storm hound. Using this action emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.</text>

    <description>Storm Hounds are companions often used by the Aarakocra. These wolf-like creatures appear to be made of wisps of cloud-like smoke with crackling lightning constantly surging through their bodies. They are often used to hunt down foes, gather meat for meals, or just additional protection. When found in the wild they quickly become vicious.

Elemental Forces. Storm hounds are beings of pure elemental force, who mimic their element to a key. Storm hounds have tempers that seem to appear like thunderous squalls, surging throughout an area in tempestuous rages. These elementals have the ability to teleport as a bolt of lighting, smashing through buildings, markets and people without thought.

    <description>These dinosaur-like creatures resemble large crocodiles but with shorter snouts and longer necks. They have a ridge of blue plates running down their backs and a gaping maw containing rows of sharp teeth. Their initial proximity to magic imbued in them elemental power, which was then bred into the species.

Shock &amp; Awe. Tempest beasts are aware of their elemental powers and make ample use of their unique capabilities in order to slay their prey. With being dangerous while in water, tempest beasts usually lie in wait on shores or within shallow water. Once their target gets too close, they home in on their target.

Caring Mothers. Despite their ferocious behavior, tempest beast mothers care and guard for their young. They share part of their game with their children in order to nurture them. There is only one thing more dangerous than a tempest beast on the hunt; a tempest beast mother guarding her young.

    <description>An illustrious emperor, the founder of a powerful dynasty, commissioned this army of constructs from the wizards of his court. They were made not to serve him in life, but to guard him in death. Platoons of terracotta sculptures in the shape of armed warriors were buried with the emperor in his massive mausoleum, to defend him during his eternal rest.

Eternal Guardians. Hidden for millennia, these stone guardians were thought by scholars to be merely decorative statues — until someone tried to move the emperor's remains.

    <description>An insane and murderous spirit trapped within a porcelain body, the Evil Doll hates all living creatures, especially those of a good alignment. It hungers to deal death and must kill to satisfy that hunger.

Sly Deceiver. Often mistaken for the toy it once was, the Evil Doll utilizes this false appearance to gain the upper hand, and trust, of unsuspecting victims, before slaying them in order to satisfy its internal lust for murder.

Terrifying Foreshadow. It is said that one might hear the evil doll's lullaby, and childish giggles, in the night well before they see her, though by that time, it is already too late. There have been few who have survived an encounter with such a being, and even less that are left psychologically unscarred. The Evil Doll is absolutely terrifying!

A successful save means the target is immune to the Hooded Charming for the next 24 hours. If the attempted possession fails, the target can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) or (Perception) check. Only on a success does the target know or realize that The Hood attempted a possession.</text>
    </action>
    <description>The Hood is an unusual type of fiend that existence relies upon a close relationship with another host creature. Hoods are normally transported to The Material Plane by demonic lords during the planning stages of an abyssal invasion to cause chaos and havoc within the invasion zone. With so many Hoods being released and so many invasions never happening, many Hoods now roam freely of their own will.

Symbiotic Connection. The Hood's existence relies upon a host to survive. The will of The Hood is near absolute, usually resulting in the host's emotional status turning vile and murderous, resulting in the death of the host and The Hood moving to a new area.

Mindless Chant. Though The Hood's will is strong, any host capable of speech has the tendency of betraying The Hood with its uncontrollable chant. Once the host becomes hungry, a chant of "Feed the hood … Feed the hood" will be heard moments before the host strikes. Many a Hood has met its doom at the mindless betrayal of its host.

Hooded Color. Most Hood's don't have a preferred color. Most choose to adopt a color appealing to the intended host. Red is popular due to blood stains, resulting from the host's murderous sprees, not being immediately visible.

    <description>Tomb spiders are arachnids infused with negative energies that have the power to reanimate corpses as hosts for their offspring.

Complex Lifecycle. A tomb spider's life cycle is a bizarre process that depends entirely on dead bodies. Once a tomb spider has mated, it selects a suitable corpse and deposits its eggs inside the cadaver. The eggs are infused with negative energy, which leaks out into the corpse and reanimating it as an undead known as a web mummy. This zombified corpse defends the mother spider from harm. As the eggs mature, they sap the nutrients from the mummy. Eventually, the eggs will hatch and the broodswarm within devours the undead for its first meal. The web mummy and broodswarm stat blocks can be found in 'Monsters of the Guild' (please see the final page of this pdf).

Potent Venom. The poison possessed by tomb spiders and their brood swarm is dangerous, not only because of its ability to burn through a creature's vascular system, but also because it carries with it some of the negative energy that the tomb spider holds. As it invades a bitten creature, it alters their physiology so that healing magic and necrotic damage are reversed.

Graveyard Denizens. Tomb spiders live on the outskirts of civilization, in dark woods on the edge of burial grounds or in unexplored depths of ancient mausoleums. Their dependency on corpses means that they can never stray too far from other living creatures. Despite this, some aggressive tomb spiders that are capable of killing enough creatures, such as horses and unfortunate travelers, do exist further out into the wilderness.

Patient Assassins. Werespiders are stealthy assassins with cold and distant personalities. They are extremely patient and can wait unmoving for days in a small space to ambush their prey. In their humanoid and hybrid forms, werespiders prefer light and ranged weapons and use surprise to bring down enemies.

Scourge of the Underdark. Werespiders are most common in the Underdark. Duergar and svirfneblin who become werespiders will usually leave their cities and wander the tunnels of the Underdark, staying in their hybrid or beast form to keep away predators. Some even head to the surface where finding prey is easier. Drow who become cursed remain in civilization and are open about their lycanthropy, claiming the condition is a blessing from Lolth.
