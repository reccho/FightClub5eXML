      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Almsgivers, as one would expect, come in many different flavors; yet they all find themselves dedicating their lives to philanthropic ventures or making charitable donations to the needy through their talents, money or time - wherever they are found. Some almsgivers study to eventually become healers or priests, others join or use their families wealth to fund organizations which are able to cross borders. There is also a rare sub-class of these dedicated humanitarians who take up arms against those who ashamedly take advantage of the poor. It is a natural step up from charity worker to adventurer, as the poor, the needy and the hungry are never far from sight.
	Why did you take the life of an almsgiver and charity worker? Did you come from a religious background? Were you once rich yourself? Did your compassion for all creatures offer you no alternative, but to become part of an altruist organization which could reach across the borders of neighboring communities and kingdoms? Discuss with your DM to determine the reason for your charity work, or you can roll on the table below to determine how your altruism manifested itself.

	• Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Religion
	• Tool Proficiencies: Herbalism Kit
	• Equipment: Herbalism Kit, winter blanket, a notebook full of herbal remedies and favorite prayers, cooking pots, set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 5gp.

      <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
      <text>Almsgivers are naturally empathic towards those in need. They feel the pain of others intimately, so much so that they can go to great lengths to alleviate it. They very often have a gathering of like-minded comrades or cohorts who they readily turn to for help. They are also very well respected, or even loved in certain towns, groups or factions. In their never-ending desire to unburden the suffering of others, not every almsgiver remains on the side of the law though; using their knowledge, connections and friends to help steal from the most fortunate in society, to give to the poor. However, one thing is for certain, almsgivers have a higher sense of purpose than most, with many of them finding solace in religion.
