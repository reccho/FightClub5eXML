    <description>The leader of the seven adventurers is an eager paladin. Brock is bold and courageous but still rather young. He began adventuring when he was a teenager. Brock obeys the laws of the kingdom and is the epitome of a loyal companion.

Inquisitive Warrior. His greatest quality is his endless enthusiasm and curiosity. Brock wants to explore the world and learn about places he's never seen before. He prefers to lead from the front and does not back down from a challenge.

Humble Beginnings. The young man grew up on a farm, far away from the bustling city of Wyld. His family is closeknit and they're hoping he'll return soon. His simple upbringing helps to keep him grounded. He doesn't trust merchants and won't believe a word they say.

Chivalry is Still Alive. Brock will do anything to protect a damsel in distress. He is a romantic at heart and believes in true love.

    <description>The annoying bard was last in line as his party crept through the dungeon. He heard an odd sound behind him. The elf troubadour turned to see a floating wizard's hat push its way into the chamber and fly towards him.

Heads Up. Some wizards use enchanted hats to protect their property. Other mages might even wear the odd construct. The hats appear to be quite ordinary and usually surprise their victims.

Mission Accepted. Wizards enchant the hats to force their victims to do certain tasks. Some hats force the wearer to leave the dungeon, other hats make their victims attack their companions. Every hat has a unique mission.

Constructed Nature. The hat doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>Some enchanted dungeons have been taken over by powerful, spellcasting dragons. An arcane dragon will move into the former lair of a formidable mage and never leave. It is thoroughly evil and merciless. It doesn't trust good dragons, believing that real dragons are evil. There are many differently-colored arcane dragons, but they are usually blue or purple.

Magical Might. These dragons are skilled spellcasters with magic that can rival most wizards. They can also shapechange into humanoids or beasts and slip into local settlements.

Patient Predator. With incredibly long lifespans, these creatures are in no rush. At times, they diligently plot for years before making a move. Most arcane dragons also enlist powerful minions to serve them.

Hefty Hoard. Legends say that arcane dragons have larger hoards than any other kind of dragon. They protect their hoard by any means, including making deals with humanoids.
