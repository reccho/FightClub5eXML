Evil Minions of the Queen. The Queen of Darkness often uses these stealthy fey to hunt down her enemies.

At Home in the Dark. Arcane stalkers are skilled at moving in the dark.

      <text>If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the giant basilisk and the two of them can see each other, the giant basilisk can force the creature to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw if the basilisk isn't incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw as the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic. A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see the giant basilisk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the giant basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.</text>

    <description>The giant basilisk has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
The giant basilisk is the king of snakes. It is a massive green and gold monster, and a deadly killer. Some folks say the basilisk was hatched by a rooster from the egg of a toad or a snake. Legend also says this monstrosity can turn someone to stone.

Serpent Leader. Other snakes and snake-like creatures often work in unison with giant basilisks. Although they don't share a language, they share a common tongue.

Rooster Retreat. Even though these monstrosities strike fear in the hearts of many, they are scared of the call of the common rooster.

Castles and Keeps. On rare occasions, a giant basilisk makes a home in a castle or large settlement.

    <description>Hiding in the darkest places of the wilderness is a horrid, malevolent creature. The boggart usually inhabits marshes or fields. Its true form is a mystery as it often takes the form of its victim's deepest fear. Some say the boggart is really a black shadowy creature. However, if a boggart is killed it simply dissolves.

Hidden Homes. These monsters often hide in burrows, under bridges, in old trees, or under logs.

Darkest Fear. Having the ability to shapechange and the ability to detect thoughts makes this monster a challenging opponent. The boggart usually changes shape when a humanoid is nearby.

Domestic Setting. At times a boggart gets inside a dwelling and causes all kinds of havoc. Many a family has been chased from their home by this nasty fey.

    <description>Brownies are peaceful, friendly members of the good Seelie Court. This small creature looks very similar to a little elf. Honest to a fault, brownies will go out of their way to take responsibility for their actions.

Peculiar Pacifist. The brownie will usually stay out of combat unless they are defending themselves or others. Playing dead is always an option for this small fey. In this state, it isn't that easy to tell if the brownie is actually dead or not.

Naturally Nimble. Although brownies are not strong, they are quite agile.

Wilderness Home. Most brownies live in the wilderness areas of Feyland. Typical dwellings include hollow trees and burrows. They make excellent guides, as they know their territory like the backs of their small hands.

    <description>You hear the clash of swords and the sound of hooves echo through the woods. The armored centaur is the warrior version of the centaur. They are led by the Oak Lord, head of the Summer Court. This tough warrior fey can attack with its sword and its hooves. All centaurs are sworn enemies of their evil cousins, the huntaurs.

Centaur Soldier. Unlike other centaurs, the armored versions aren't wanderers. Most of these centaurs are part of the Seelie Court and form a significant part of the warrior ranks.

Useful Mounts. Armored centaurs are willing to be mounts for good-aligned creatures, including their elven allies.

Sword Masters. These fey are adept at sword fighting and can even use their melee weapons to block attacks.

    <description>The most unusual of the centaurs is the centaur mage. These fey have a number of spells at their disposal. Armored centaurs and centaur mages give the good fey a powerful force to fend off their dark foes. As with the armored centaurs, they are sworn enemies of the huntaurs.

Summer Court. Centaur mages belong to the Summer Court, a division of the Seelie Court. Although their usual leader is the Oak Lord, ultimately these centaurs serve Titania and Oberon. A number of female centaur mages have fallen in love with the fey king.

Arcane Focus. The centaur mage's staff is their arcane focus. If it is destroyed or taken away, they lose any ability to cast spells.

Even in Feyland their pale bodies and large eyes are noticeable. They are extremely stealthy and are used as spies by both of the fey courts.

Diplomatic Doppelganger. Changelings are patient and calm and make very good diplomats.

Cautious Creature. These creatures are rather sensitive and take their time getting to know others and trying new activities. However, changelings often wander far from their homes as they are curious about other races.

Prolific Performers. A large number of changelings end up as entertainers. Their many gifts lend themselves to the performing arts.

    <description>As you emerge into the clearing you notice a shimmering spectral elk and rider. The hooded figure holds a mighty lance pointing towards you. A doom rider has arrived to eliminate you. This dark fey is part of the Autumn Court, a division of the Unseelie Court. The rider and mount are inseparable.

Doom Bringer. When the Skeleton King decides he needs to kill someone, he sends a doom rider to take care of it. Doom riders usually make their homes in the Bone Castle with their leader. They know the geography of Feyland very well and will use the most direct route to hunt down their prey.

Undead Nature. The doom rider doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>While tracking the enemy, you suddenly begin to question your mission. You could be under the influence of the doubt trout. The doubt trout is a very unusual fey creature. They are usually found in rivers and lakes in Feyland. They glow bright orange and stand out in the clear blue and green bodies of water. A school of the glowing fish is quite a stunning sight.

Drain Confidence. In the presence of these fey, one is drained of confidence and doubt begins to take over. A strange tingling sensation can be felt all over the body.

Interior Lives. At times, powerful beings capture these creatures and place them in containers in their lairs. This puts any strangers at a significant disadvantage. Doubt trout can also double as indoor lanterns.

Once the dream terrain is activated, the dream dragon chooses what form it takes. The dream dragon also is able to use an action to have an element from the terrain strike out and attack one target, the target must succeed on DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 60 (11d10) bludgeoning damage. The hallucinatory terrain is only destroyed if the dream dragon is defeated.</text>

    <description>Without warning, a rainbow-colored dragon emerges from the depths of the forest. The dream dragon is one of the rarest of all dragons. Highly intelligent, it uses its unique breath weapon to ensnare victims.

Bewildering Terrain. The breath of the dream dragon creates a magical terrain where the winged monster will face down its opponents. If one member of the party is drawn inside, all the heroes are sent into the dream terrain. Disturbingly, the dragon has some control over the terrain and can use it to attack its enemies. The only way to escape is to defeat the evil wyrm in combat.

Hefty Hoarders. Dream dragons are known to collect a huge amount of treasure. They usually hide their hoard in a cavern at the center of their territory. Goblins and ogres are often enslaved to guard these hoards.

Although the target isn't under the dryad queen's control, it takes the dryad queen's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can. Each time the dryad queen or its allies do something harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours, or until the dryad queen dies, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or ends the effect as a bonus action. If a target's saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the dryad queen's Fey Charm for the next 24 hours.

Both were at court long ago and the evil queen grew jealous. However, this dryad has decided to make the best of the situation.

Leader of the Dryads. Other dryads look up to their queen as they know what she has been through. Their leader has fallen further than any of them, yet she holds her head high.

Unique Swords. All fey knights wield a unique weapon called the Sword of Light. This shinning sword can ward off dark creatures with its intense light.

    <description>Fey nobles form the elf leadership in Feyland. They are usually members of the good Seelie Court. These elves think highly of themselves and often exaggerate their influence. Most of the fey nobles make their home in the Tree Castle, the headquarters of the Seelie Court. Some have tree homes on the outskirts of Feyland. These nobles often have good relationships with the wild fey.

Fey Service. A number of fey knights and fey rangers can be found in the service of a fey noble. These minions serve the higher-ranking elf for many years.

    <description>The fey ranger is an elite elf warrior who fights against the dark fey. This skilled elf is especially adept at stealth. Using magic, this ranger can move quietly and quickly through the thickest of woods. Their agility and magic resistance also enable these fey to minimize the damage they take.

Forest Guardians. Striding through the deepest parts of the woods, these brave guardians fight against evil. Dark fey aren't afraid of much but these rangers cause them to watch their backs in the woods. The fey ranger works with other good creatures; such as unicorns, treants, and sprites, to guard the forests from the forces of evil.

Elite Warriors. The Seelie Court uses the fey rangers as part of their elite force of warriors. They are equally skilled with the sword and bow.

These beautiful fey are fully aware that Orchid wants to leave the Seelie Court and strike out on her own. The everflowers plan to remain loyal to their leader. Many of these gregarious fey find life at the Unseelie Court more exciting.

Popular Performances. The everflowers are known throughout the land and many creatures are fans of their performances. They never seem to tire and move with tremendous grace. Everflowers often leap into the air in the latter stages of their dances, suddenly revealing they can fly.

You have met the brooding, melancholy autumn faerie. These evil creatures are in the service of the Unseelie Court. Their leader is the head of the Autumn Court, the Skeleton King.

Wrathful Wreck. The sensitive autumn faerie is an emotional wreck. Their only pleasure in life is using violence to cause chaos.

Harvest Time. Autumn faeries have a strong connection to harvest time. They are more active at this time of year and can be seen near farmers' fields.

They are led day-to-day by the head of the Spring Court, the Lady of the Swans.

Flower Fashion. These tiny fey are usually dressed in garb from their surroundings. They often wear beautiful flowers in their hair and fashion outfits from leaves. Pastel colors are their favourite colors.

Icy Swords. Like their summer cousins, these fey are armed with two swords. The swords are made of ice and the winter faeries attack twice, once with the offhand.

The fey caterpillar isn't one of the friendliest creatures. It is known to make rude comments and ask difficult questions. These fey don't like visitors and will give them an especially difficult time.

Peculiar Pipe. The fey caterpillar's pipe enables them to send out magical rings. This pipe works for any creature, not just this fey.

Puzzling Poetry. Every now and then this creature spouts obscure poems and riddles. If newcomers can make sense of any of these, the fey caterpillar will be rather impressed.

    <description>The fey-touched are humanoids who lost their minds after ending up in Feyland. Most fey-touched used to be humans. They often enter the land of the fey by going through a magical portal.

Lost in Feyland. As the fey-touched spend more time in Feyland they forget their former lives. Most need assistance if they are to ever find their way home again.

Collective Confusion. Simply being in the presence of these lost souls affects other creatures. Many of the local fey avoid contact with these creatures.

    <description>Roaming the darkest woods is the forest hag. These monsters are birthed from a cursed womb. The Queen of Darkness or one of the other evil arch fey curses a child to become one with the decomposers of the forest.

Despoiler of the Forest. This hag wants the forest around her to become as rotten as she is. She lives on hallucinogenic mushrooms that continue to warp her mind.

Inner Rage. Deep inside the forest hag is a lost soul and that rage eats her alive. She enjoys tormenting others and bringing their downfall. Most of the inhabitants of the woods loathe her, but she is strong enough to survive on her own. Like some other hags, she can alter her appearance. This enables her to walk amongst other fey.

    <description>Giant bulbous eyes emerge from the swamp. You suddenly begin to forget how to speak and your spells don't work. This is the forget frog, one of the oddest creatures in Feyland. They are allies of the frog witch and the toadman.

Lost Thoughts. The gaze of the forget frog has a powerful effect. It affects spellcasters adversely and its victims are also unable to speak. Sometimes the victims of a forget frog are thought to be fey-touched.

Poisonous. These evil frogs are also very poisonous. They can even spit this poison from afar.

    <description>The frog witch lives in the swampy areas of Feyland. This evil fey has her eyes on ruling all of the lands of the fey. She is a very wise and cunning opponent who has already taken over many of the swamps. Those who dare to enter her territory speak of a strange witch riding a frog mount.

Leader of the Frogs. Her minions include numerous giant frogs and giant toads, as well as the Toadman. The Toadman is her chief henchman and a powerful foe in his own right.

    <description>Visitors to this mysterious land often encounter giant butterflies. The extraordinary patterns on their glistening wings are admired by all. These brilliantly-colored beasts begin their lives as fey caterpillars. After many years, the caterpillars spin cocoons and slowly transform into their butterfly form. Giant butterflies feed off the nectar from the large flowers.

Common Mounts. Many creatures attempt to gain a giant butterfly mount. However, these creatures are selective. They refuse to let any evil creature ride them. Some fey believe that these creatures will bring them good fortune.

Wind Power. These beasts beat their wings to knock down anyone or anything that attacks them or their rider.

    <description>A loud droning sound echoes through the woods and a large insect comes into view. The giant dragonfly is one of the many flying creatures in the land of the fey. However, these beasts are rarely encountered. They are extremely agile fliers and can dart between obstacles with ease.

Magnificent Mounts. Their exceptional flying ability makes them highly prized mounts. Unlike giant butterflies, they will let anyone ride them. Both the good Seelie Court and evil Unseelie Court use these creatures as mounts.

Dragonfly Diet. Giant dragonflies usually feed on other insects. They live off carrion when they can't find any other food.

    <description>The giant fox is one of the most common mounts for the fey. These omnivores hunt small animals, eat birds, eggs, insects, berries, fungi, and carrion. These beasts will let fey ride them in exchange for food.

The Pack. Giant foxes stick together and are usually found in a skulk. If they attack as a group, they can put up quite a fight.

Hidden Home. These beasts make their homes in secretive dens. They mate for life and have litters of up to six kits.

    <description>The inquisitive giant rabbit is found throughout the land of the fey. Most fey are slightly cautious in dealing with these beasts. Many creatures are apprehensive because the wererabbit is almost as common.

Appetites for Destruction. The few farming communities in Feyland are on guard for giant rabbits. These beasts can destroy fields full of crops in a matter of days.

Busy Burrows. Giant rabbits usually make their homes in large burrows with many other rabbits. They have sizeable litters of young and their communities grow rapidly.

Aggressive Attitudes. Giant swans are very aggressive and will not hesitate to defend themselves. They have a nasty bite.

Mounts. Some fey creatures use these giant beasts as mounts. They are often found in the service of the Lady of the Swans and her swan maidens.

    <description>The giant tortoise is one of the largest creatures in all of Feyland. These ancient beings are also rarely seen, except in the deepest of woods. At times these monsters will enter rivers or lakes to rest. They are able to breathe underwater for a short period of time.

Pack Animal. These massive beasts can be used to carry a huge load. Both fey courts have used these creatures in their ongoing war. Having a beast that can carry hundreds of pounds of supplies has appealed to the Seelie and Unseelie courts.

    <description>You might glimpse something small sitting on a flat rock. However, the lake gnome is a surprisingly powerful creature. They have enough magic to alter the consciousness of someone forever. Lake gnomes are deeply in touch with the very essence of nature and life itself.

Lake Homes. The lake gnomes get their name from their traditional environment. However, these magical gnomes can also be found in rivers and other wilderness areas.

Unknown Gnomes. Lake gnomes are smaller than any other gnomes. They also move quickly, making them difficult to see. These mysterious creatures can live up to 500 years.

Ancient Truths. The deep wisdom hidden in Feyland is available to these remarkable beings. They see a much bigger version of reality than many others.

    <description>Leading all of the goblins is a rather eccentric character. He is by far the most powerful goblin, but is ultimately in the service of the Queen of Darkness. His appearance is rather unusual. This humanoid leader prides himself on being dressed in extravagant outfits. The goblin king also strides around playing with three crystal orbs in his hands.

Court Trickster. He is the head trickster of the Unseelie Court. Even the rowdy gremlins admire his talents. The Queen of Darkness finds him amusing and insane. There is purpose to his madness though, he seeks more power for the lowly goblin race.

    <description>The sound of drums echoes through the mountains of Feyland. A goblin shaman has cast a spell to aid his people. Tribal Leadership. The goblin king surrounds himself with a number of these spellcasters. In the goblin hierarchy, the shamans are only surpassed by their king.

Dark Depths. The goblin shaman is at home in the darkest caverns of the mountains. It will extinguish any sources of light immediately.

Cruelest of them All. Goblins are known to revel in the misery of others. Their shamans are the cruelest of their kind and will torment anyone they get the upper hand on.

Crazy King. Although the goblin king trusts his shamans, the feeling isn't mutual. These spellcasters think the king is insane and plot to overthrow him.

    <description>Unlike its smaller cousins, the winged goblin is a bulky, muscled monster. However, like its cousins, it is still a cruel and selfish humanoid. This is a creature that enters the nightmares of those who encounter it. The winged goblin usually makes its home in caves in desolate mountain ranges. However, some of these evil humanoids have been known to live in the dark woods as well.

Awkward Flight. This goblin also has wings, although it is a very clumsy flier. Some folk say the winged goblins are a result of foul magic and they are still learning how to use their wings.

Cruel Captors. At times, winged goblins will take prisoners simply to play with them. They enjoy being in control and like to draw out their victims' suffering. If someone sees a winged goblin carrying off a victim, they know it will probably end badly.

    <description>This trickster can cause all sorts of trouble. Gremlins are in the service of the Queen of Darkness and her Unseelie Court. They are often found in large groups.

Terrible Tricksters. Gremlins are extremely violent fey that cause destruction all over Feyland. They are loathed by most, tolerated by a few.

Mass Effect. A single gremlin is bad enough, but they are even worse when found in groups. They work together at times and cause even more havoc.

Troublemaking Tinkers. Gremlins love tinkering with vehicles and other complex mechanisms. They have been known to sabotage wagons and sailing vessels.

Intoxicating. The harvest maiden uses all her charms to seduce her victims. Seemingly harmless, these fey are actually ruthless and highly ambitious.

Servant of the King. The harvest maidens are also loyal to the Queen of Darkness and seek to emulate her. They delight in intimidating less powerful fey.

Relentless Rage. At the core of the hater's being is a deep sadness. The rage and anger they manifest is really a shell that covers a vulnerable place.

Hidden Horrors. Haters enjoy hiding in large crowds and insulting artists, those in love, and writers. They will use their magic to sow discontent and foster rumors.

Misery Loves Company. Now and then, haters will join together in groups to steal works of art or critique artists.

    <description>The hatter is a crazy, gregarious character who wanders the woods. He enjoys toying with others and revels in confusion and chaos. This unusual fey makes odd personal remarks, recites poems, and asks complicated riddles.

Wild Madman. There is no rhyme or reason to his actions, except maybe in his poetry. The hatter lives in the moment and enjoys it to the fullest. He is one of the wild fey and isn't aligned with either of the courts.

Happy Host. The hatter enjoys hosting parties in the woods for his friends and newcomers to Feyland. In fact, he seems to always be hosting some kind of party.

Hat Attack. This strange fey wields no weapons but he can use his hats to attack. He has four kinds of magical hats that he can throw to create different effects. These hats magically appear in the hatter's hand. The hats can be removed but the magic effect continues. The hatter has two of each kind in his bag.

    <description>Among the most terrifying sights in Feyland is this monster galloping down a forest trail. The headless horsemen are minions of the Skeleton King. A number of these strange riders are in the service of the Fall Court, a division of the Unseelie Court. They are always found riding a flaming nightmare.

Joined at the Hip. The mount of the horseman will obey it and fight to the death to protect the rider. The rider cannot be knocked off and does not dismount. However the nightmare cannot use Ethereal Stride until the rider is slain.

Undead Nature. A headless horseman doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>The bald, bluish-grey versions of the centaurs are the huntaurs. These powerfully-built creatures are the evil cousins to their centaur neighbours. Unlike the centaurs, these fey seek out conflict. They don't like warm climates and live in the coolest, darkest areas of the woods.

The Queen's Army. Most huntaurs are part of the Unseelie Court and form a significant part of their warrior ranks. They are savage, brutal warriors who enjoy combat.

Unwilling Mounts. Like the centaur mage, these creatures refuse to be used as mounts. They will fight anyone who attempts to ride them.

    <description>Perhaps the cruelest members of the Unseelie Court are the three ice princesses. These arch fey report directly to the Snow Queen, their mother. The trio of arch fey worship the snow she walks on. They are vicious, cold-hearted, and find it hard to let go of grudges.

Palace Plot. The ice princesses know of the Snow Queen's ambition to take the Unseelie throne from the Queen of Darkness. They support their mother and seek to undermine her rival any way they can.

Icy Words. An icy mist pours forth when an ice princess speaks. Even worse, these dark fey have a powerful song that can freeze the listener.

    <description>The jabberwock is an out-of-control monster who wanders the farthest edges of Feyland. Making strange burbling noises, it crashes through the woods. If the jabberwock is near, everyone is fully aware of its presence. Fey creatures flee when this notorious dragon arrives on the scene.

Chaos Embodied. This wild dragon is the personification of chaotic evil. It embodies violence and rage.

Achilles Heel. Although it is a mighty foe, the jabberwock has an Achilles heel. It is vulnerable to magical swords, and with some luck it can be beheaded.

Burble and Flame. A mighty foe, the Jabberwock can blast flames from its eyes and confuses opponents with its strange sounds.

    <description>This beast is a sturdy war dog commonly used by goblins, gnomes, and halfling warriors. These beasts are a result of worgs and mastiffs breeding. They are usually outfitted with studded leather armor.

Loyal Companion. The jarog is stubbornly loyal and will sacrifice itself for its rider. However, this stubbornness results in conflicts, especially with goblins. Jarogs will also fight for each other and work well as a pack.

Brave Beast. This beast will never back down from a fight and has little fear of larger opponents. There are even stories of jarogs fighting off packs of worgs.

    <description>Oberon rules the Seelie Court with his partner, Titania. He is the king of nature, wild places, and animals. This charming, handsome fey is taller than most fey, but he has no wings.

Down to Earth. Unlike Titania, Oberon is very relatable and is revered by all good and neutral fey. He spends a great deal of time away from his throne with the common fey.

Court Rival. There is some drama in the Seelie Court, the Oak Lord is attempting to take the place of Oberon.

Constant Companions. Oberon is usually accompanied by the royal stag and his loyal owl. The king often uses the scrying spell to see through the eyes of his owl familiar.

Fey Deal. One can offer the log shadow treasure in the form of gold or precious gemstones. An alternative is to offer some kind of service to the monster.

Consequences. If the deal is accepted by the log shadow they will teleport the target to an empty log further into the woods. However, if the deal goes badly the target will be sent to a random empty log or they'll be attacked by the log shadow.

Old Roots. Log shadows are formed when evil spirits are trapped in the logs by the elder tree.

    <description>The evil werebadger is one of the lycanthropes unique to Feyland. These brave creatures can blend into small communities or live in hidden burrows. They usually attack with their claws and jaws and don't always pass on their curse.

Vicious Vermin. They are often referred to as the wererats of the woods. These lycanthropes are cunning and sly. They form loyal clans that work together to get what they need. Werebadgers are extremely hard-working and determined. Groups of these lycanthropes can be challenging opponents.

    <description>The werefox is a sly and charming lycanthrope. They are the most curious of their kind and will usually blend into small communities. Unlike the other lycanthropes in Feyland, they keep their true form secret. They feel most at home in the deepest part of the woods.

Charming Creatures. These lycanthropes will use their charms to get what they need. Werefoxes have dubious reputations in the land of the fey.

    <description>Wererabbits are the chief messengers for both fey courts. Rather timid at heart, these odd lycanthropes prefer to stand aside once conflict breaks out.

Slaves to Time. As they are constantly rushing about, they are obsessed with time. They often carry hourglasses and fret about delivering the next message on time. These creatures also have a handful of spells that can help them in their duties.

Always Anxious. Wererabbits are very neurotic and extremely timid. This high sensitivity causes them much distress.

The Master of the Hunt is the leader of this group of hunters in wild pursuit. Eight wild riders riding wild horses and wild hounds charge forward with the group. A loud roar and the sound of intense winds sound as the wild hunt passes by.

Leading the Charge. Their prey is chosen before they embark on the hunt. They are not part of the Seelie or Unseelie Court but do hunt for them at times.

    <description>Without warning, you hear heavy footsteps behind you. Out of the mist a giant appears. This is the mist giant, a dangerous foe in the dark wood. These evil giants stalk their prey and strike when it suits them. They are also adept at hiding in foul weather.

Stubborn Souls. Mist giants are known to be rather stubborn. They don't enjoy taking orders. The Mountain Lord has a challenging time keeping them in the fold.

Terrible Thoughts. Although mist giants can pummel most creatures into submission, they are also quite intelligent. They will take their time and gradually pick off the weakest members of a group.

    <description>Floating through thickest of fogs is a mist phantom. This monster is filled with evil energies. Healthy beasts flee and plants wilt. This large undead creature haunts the darkest corners of Feyland.

Phantom Presence. Simply being in the presence of these horrors is disturbing. Any creature that gets close to the mist phantom will regret it.

Undead Nature. A mist phantom doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>The mountain lord is the king of all giants. Unlike most giants, he is very wise and quite intelligent. This giant operates separately from the two fey courts.

Lofty Ambitions. The mountain lord is plotting to take over Feyland by pitting the Seelie and Unseelie courts against each other.

Towering Throne. Most giants live in a huge cave complex deep in the mountains of Feyland. A collection of rock giants, mist giants, hill giants, and ogres make up the inhabitants. The mountain lord makes his home in these caverns.

Ogre Minions. All the ogres, including the ogre king are allied with the giants in Feyland. Many ogres are used to do the dirty work for their larger cousins.

    <description>The night hound is an evil fey creature that looks like a stocky mastiff. This evil monster is usually in the service of more powerful fey. These hounds are extremely stealthy and often steal treasure or kidnap children for dark fey.

Reliable Retrievers. The night hound is known to be successful in hunting down items. There are many tales of an artifact going missing and a strange hound being reported in the area.

Kidnappers. Most disturbing, however, are the tales of these evil fey kidnapping children. Young fey are warned about these hounds at an early age.

Legendary Loners. Unlike most hounds and mastiffs, the night hound is a loner. They hate other hounds and mastiffs and will attack them on sight, including other night hounds.

    <description>The nymph is a dedicated protector of nature. They are very inquisitive and continue to explore unknown areas. These fey live very much in the moment and appreciate every new creature and location they discover. However, their curiosity has also gotten them into trouble.

One with Nature. The nymph is deeply connected to the environment around it. An attack on the wilderness is considered an attack on them. Nymphs often make their homes in rugged and isolated areas.

Dazzling Beauty. Incredibly attractive, these wild fey can blind a newcomer with their beauty. The inhabitants of Feyland know to avert their eyes from these fey.

This large arch fey is brave and bold and charges headfirst into conflicts. The Oak Lord is decisive and acts with total confidence.

Centaur Leader. He is the leader of the centaurs and commands a mighty force of warriors. This fey cavalry makes up the bulk of the Seelie Court's forces.

Courting Disaster. The Oak Lord has fallen in love with Titania. He knows his obsession with her could spell trouble for the Seelie Court. However, this arch fey continues to pursue the queen at every opportunity.

    <description>The ogre king is the leader of the ogres and lives in the mountainous part of Feyland. A large, dark cavern is his home. Numerous ogres, ogre magi, and minions make the cavern their home as well.

Minor King. Considering all the powerful royalty in Feyland, this ogre is not a major player. However, he can also be underestimated at times.

Giant Servants. The Mountain Lord and his giants often like to use the ogres to do their dirty work. Not the brightest creatures, the ogres can often be talked into dangerous tasks.

Door Shield. The ogre king wields a large wooden door as his shield.

Double Trouble. This monster is a fearsome combination of brute and spellcaster. They are extremely aggressive and will attack without hesitation.

Close to the King. These creatures are known to be close allies of the ogre king. They stay in close communication with their leader. However, ogre magi are much more intelligent and can manipulate the king. Some of these evil humanoids feel they can replace their leader.

    <description>Orchid is the beautiful teenage rebel of the Seelie Court. She is very energetic and can't sit still. This trait leads her into all kinds of mischief. At court Orchid is known as the Wild Child.

Seelie Rebel. She is a volatile and dangerous fey, unpredictable in her actions. The young fey is fed up with the life at court and wants to strike out on her own. She is even curious about her aunt, the Queen of Darkness. Orchid has made plans to visit the Unseelie Court. She has been charmed by the evil queen. This fey is in danger of being recruited by the enemy.

Wild Nature. Rather than be in court in the Tree Castle, she prefers to wander the wilds of Feyland. Orchid and her everflower dancers spend much of their time dancing in the woods.

    <description>The pond of reflection is a malevolent fey which tries to lure victims with their own vanity. This monster lies in wait for a creature with a large ego.

Suprising Strength. These fey are quite strong and can drown unsuspecting victims.

Don't Dwell. The inhabitants of Feyland know better than to look at their reflections too long. All the young are taught this lesson at a very early age. If slain, a pond of reflection becomes an inanimate pool of water.

    <description>The Prince of the Pipes is the leader of the satyrs. He appears as an extremely handsome satyr. Like others of his kind, he is guided by curiosity and hedonism. However, he has much more patience than his brethren.

Senior Satyr. The exploits of the prince are well known and other satyrs seek to emulate their leader.

Confident Charmer. The prince brags that he can charm anyone, it's just a question of time.

Magical Pipes. This fey plays pipes similar those used by other satyrs. However, his Pipes of Feyland are more powerful and have some unique effects.

    <description>The Prince of Twilight is an evil arch fey who makes use of illusions. He is malicious and envious of all those who have found peace in the everyday world. Some folk who encounter this creature aren't ever sure what is real ever again.

Terrible Trickster. The prince is the chief trickster in the Unseelie Court. His antics cause all sorts of problems in the Fortress of Shade and he is barely tolerated. His closest ally is the equally rebellious Riverwind. However, even the court teenager thinks the prince can be cruel.

Master of Illusions. This evil fey strikes fear into the inhabitants of Feyland. Once he arrives on the scene, chaos is soon to follow. The prince enjoys blending into peaceful communities and terrorizing the locals. He despises good fey and any newcomers.

    <description>The brightly-colored protea is avoided by the creatures of Feyland. This beautiful plant can cause many problems for those travelling nearby. If someone travels close enough, the plant opens up and bites.

Slow Death. This plant is large enough to swallow Medium or smaller creatures. Once inside, victims are vulnerable to any attacks on the protea. They will also start to be digested by the plant's acids.

Fire Flower. Proteas are immune to fire. They grow in areas that have been devastated by forest fires.

    <description>The purple dragon is a cunning, scheming dragon with many tricks up its sleeve. This monster casts spells, bellows a draconic shout, and can also attack with its jaws and claws. It delights in making complicated pacts with newcomers to Feyland.

Magical Menace. This monster is one of the few dragons that can use magic. Purple dragons often like to toy with their prey, using their subtle spells before moving in for the kill.

Dragon Shout. The magical shout of a purple dragon can be heard for a great distance. Trees bend and the shout usually knocks over any creatures in its path.

Stealthy Surprise. For a creature its size, the purple dragon is surprisingly stealthy and has been known to emerge out of the shadows in the darkest parts of the woods.

    <description>A shadow crosses the ground. You notice a dark shape with four wings is above you. The quadrak is a smaller dragon often used as a mount.

Fiery Opponent. Although this dragon is smaller than it cousins, it is still a dangerous opponent. It breathes fire and can attack with its jaws and claws. Quadraks enjoy bullying the weak, like their goblin allies.

Perfect Mount. The Unseelie Court are known to use these mounts for quick strikes against their enemies. They can manoeuvre into many areas that other kinds of mounts cannot. A group of goblin riders make up the bulk of this aerial cavalry.

    <description>Leading the evil Unseelie Court is the powerful Queen of Darkness. She is also the queen of magic and murder. Some know her as the Queen of Bats. This ruthless arch fey rules over the two divisions of the Unseelie Court: the Winter Court and the Autumn Court. She is a hateful, spiteful monster who seeks to destroy the Seelie Court.

Dark Sister. The queen is actually the sister of Titania, one of the leaders of the Seelie Court. Darkness overcame her and she lost her claim to the throne of the good fey.

Evil Minions. As the leader of the Unseelie Court, the queen has numerous minions at her disposal. Six hellhounds always accompany this evil fey. Other dark fey, undead, and evil elves fill her court.

Powerful Mount. At times the queen rides a nightmare, or a black unicorn.

The rainman can only grapple one Medium creature or up to two Small or Tiny creatures at one time with this ability. At the start of each of the rainman's turns, each grappled target takes 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage. As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the rainman can pull a creature or an object away from it by succeeding on a DC 13 Strength check.</text>

    <description>Hiding in the heaviest of rainfalls, is a dangerous monster. The rainman is a cruel and vicious hunter. This fey only takes form in the rain and can't survive out of water. It will hide in the rain and surprise its victims. Surprisingly strong, this fey will then attempt to drown the unsuspecting creature. They are one of the most hated creatures in all of Feyland.

Patient Stalker. Rainmen have been known to stalk their victims for hours. They will wait patiently for the right moment to strike.

Deadly Drowning. If it kills a creature, the rainman absorbs it and leaves a puddle of water behind. Once a rainman is slain, it disolves into the ground.

    <description>You glimpse what appears to be a stunning, vivid rhododendron. Suddenly a loud blast of sound hits you and you can't hear anything. This burst of sound is from a bizarre plant known as the rhododeadrum.

Sonic Surprise. The sound is overpowering, as if a thousand bees were in chorus. The sonic burst only affects one creature at a time.

Silent Gardens. Some evil fey intentionally place these plants near their lairs. These areas are known as 'silent gardens'. The vast area below the floating fortress of the Unseelie Court is covered in these plants.

    <description>Riverwind is the wild teenage archer of the Unseelie Court. Due to his moody nature and constant need to rebel, he is always at the center of some kind of drama. Even though he has been around for hundreds of years, he is the eternal teenager. He is still emotionally immature and impulsive.

Winds of Change. This arch fey can conjure winds around himself to great affect. Surrounded by the changing winds of Feyland, Riverwind feels at home.

Moody Blue. Riverwind is a brooding loner who enjoys his solitude. This lost soul is now questioning his place in the Unseelie Court and is making overtures towards the rival court.

    <description>The rock giant appears to be a walking pile of boulders. Rock giants live in the mountainous region of Feyland and serve the Mountain Lord. To their leader they barely rank above the lowly ogres. The king of the giants has little respect for these simple creatures. In rocky terrain they blend into their surroundings.

Rock Solid. Made of solid rock, these giants are capable of withstanding tremendous damage. They also have an unlimited supply of rocks to hurl at their enemies. To throw a rock, they simply pull one off of their stony body.

Dim-witted. Rock giants are unintelligent and can be easily fooled. The Mountain Lord only uses these giants for the simplest of tasks.

    <description>Many fey say the most beautiful sight in their land is seeing the royal stag racing between the trees. The royal stag is the leader of all giant elks. This creature is often seen as a shining light in dark times. The royal stag protects the woods and other good-aligned creatures. It often accompanies the Oak Lord or Oberon on walks through the dense forest. Centaurs and elves are closely allied with this huge fey.

Prize Trophy. Many evil fey have a strong desire to kill this beautiful creature and keep it as a trophy. Legend also says that the blood of the royal stag can provide immortality. This isn't entirely true, the magical blood will enable a slain creature to be reincarnated one day later. However, the creature's alignment is also changed to match the royal stag.

    <description>Walking through the woods you come upon a number of deformed, rotten trees. Suddenly they launch short sharp branches at everyone in the party. These unusual undead creatures are known as ruined trees.

Rotten to the Core. This undead creature is pure evil and seeks to destroy life. They are most dangerous when lining either side of a forest trail, or river. An adventuring party can find themselves attacked from both sides.

Dark Roots. Once a ruined tree's victim is dying on the ground, they send out their roots to decompose the victim. Then the undead monster absorbs the life form.

Stealthy Surprise. This stealthy fey tiptoes through the night looking for victims. He moves in almost complete silence in the darkness.

Kidnapper. The sandman can be hired as a kidnapper. Dark fey and other evil creatures have been known to enlist him.

    <description>Looking to the skies, one might see a flock of black birds. They could be harmless, or they could be eerie shadow birds. Most fey will flee the area. These creatures are more shadow than substance.

Spies in the Sky. Some dark fey, such as the Queen of Darkness, can actually see through the eyes of these birds. The Seelie Court is fully aware that these creatures are used as spies by the enemy.

Undead Nature. A shadow bird doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

If has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the shadowy tree, and it takes 17 (5d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of the shadowy tree's turns. The tree can only have one target swallowed at a time. If the shadowy tree dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the trunk using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.</text>

    <description>Without warning, the tree in front of you suddenly blackens and turns into a creepy, tangled monster. This evil plant lies in wait until suitable prey wanders near. The shadowy tree is made of a dark energy that protects it against fire.

Wrong Place, Wrong Time. If a creature gets too close to this evil tree, it could be the last thing they do. This horrid plant can swallow its victims.

Packs a Wallop. Not only can the shadowy tree bite and swallow victims, it can also slam its branches into them. The victims of this tree often litter the ground around it. Piles of broken skeletons lying at the base of a tree provide a clear warning.

The siren must take bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the siren is incapacitated. While charmed by the siren, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other sirens. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the siren, the target must move on its turn towards the siren by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the siren, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it. A target that successfully saves is immune to this siren's song for the next 24 hours.</text>

    <description>Sailors will sometimes hear a beautiful song as they near the rocky coast. This enchanting song is being sung by the siren. Its true form is part bird, part female humanoid creature. Hundreds of years ago, a jealous witch altered their beautiful form and banished these fey from the land.

Vengeful Vixens. Sirens are out for revenge and seek to lure those near the coast. Sailors have even been known to wreck their ships as they are drawn closer to rocky shores.

Forgotten Fey. Still angry about the curse that altered their form, sirens use their shapechange ability to return to land at times. Once on land, the siren attempts to use all its charms to lure more victims.

Undead Cavalry. Skeleton warriors use these powerful mounts to ride around Feyland. There are stories of anti-paladins, evil arch fey, hags, or even witches riding on these dark mounts.

Undead Nature. A skeletal spider doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

Shadowy Trickster. Even though this monster is deadly, he enjoys playing games with visitors to the dark part of the Feyland. He will dispose of them when he tires of the games.

Bone Castle. The skeleton king's ultimate goal is to lure creatures into his castle made of bones.

Like other sprites, they make their homes in trees, toadstools, flowers, glades, and treants. Aggressive and tough for their size, these fey creatures can be a handful.

Proud Protectors. Sprite knights are the first of the sprites to confront intruders in their territory. These tiny fey defend their homes with swords and poisoned arrows. Like other sprites, they can also turn invisible.

Judges of the Heart. All sprites are very perceptive and can sense a creature's alignment and emotions. The sprite knight is no exception and allies itself with other good creatures.

Coastal Homes. Inhabitants of the coastal communities in Feyland live in constant fear of this monster.

Vessels Vanquished. This massive dragon is a scourge to many a vessel. They can do a tremendous amount of damage to ships of any size.

    <description>The storyweaver is one of the most mysterious figures in all of Feyland. Nobody knows how old he is or where he comes from. He is not allied with the two feuding courts and is truly a wild fey.

Legendary Tales. The incredible history and stories of the fey are collected by this strange character.

Seer. More than any other creature, except maybe the Elder Tree, the storyweaver has a window into the future.

Important Lessons. If one listens to the tales of the storyweaver, they can always learn lessons that will help them in their lives. However, it is not a good idea to get on his bad side.

    <description>A large swan swims to the shore and then morphs into a beautiful humanoid. These fey are the handmaidens of the Lady of the Swans. As such they are part of the Spring Court, a division of the Seelie Court.

Peaceful Pilgrims. Swan maidens are as peaceful and calm as their arch fey leader. They will only use violence to protect themselves. These pretty fey spend their time caring for the beasts and plants. If they encounter hostile foes, the inhabitants of the wild will come to their aid.

Swan Mount. These blissful creatures usually ride on giant swans. They often use the swans to travel around rivers and lakes.

    <description>Sylphs are very beautiful winged creatures that dwell in aerial places. They enjoy wandering and aren't often encountered in their lairs. These lairs are small caves on the sides of mountains, or high atop the tallest trees. Sylphs are solitary and are rarely found in groups.

Greater Good. Sylphs will often aid other creatures of good alignment. They have been known to assist adventuring parties.

Flighty Fey. These fey can walk but prefer to remain airborne. Sylphs are closely allied with air elementals and can call on their aid.

    <description>Guarding the entrances to Feyland are beings known as thresholders. These agile sentinels lurk near gates, faerie rings, and other thresholds.

Multiple Personalities. Each thresholder is different and could be in the service of either of the fey courts. Some are completely independent and have their own motivations.

Judging Harshly. Regardless of who or what they serve, these guardians are harsh judges. They will question any newcomers about their business and decide whether they are worthy enough to visit. If the thresholder decides the strangers aren't worthy, it will order them to leave. Thresholders will attack anyone that disobeys their orders.

    <description>The toadman is the henchman of the Frog Witch. He lives in the swampy forests of Feyland and does whatever his mistress desires. A strange frog-like humanoid, he wears studded leather armor and a ragged cloak.

Swamp Dweller. At home in the swamp, the toadman can blend in and hide with ease. He spends most of his time at the Frog Witch's hut.

Amphibian Allies. The toadman forms strong bonds with giant frogs, which are often used as guardians. It also uses them as mounts. He is more popular with the denizens of the swamp than his cruel mistress. However, this fey is wise enough to know he gains many benefits as the henchman of the powerful witch.

    <description>The tree of dread is a dark version of the treant. It is an evil tree that lives in the deepest part of the woods.

Deep Sickness. The Tree of Dread is a tree that was dying of disease and was awakened by dark forces. Evil druids are usually part of the long process that awakens these monsters.

Evil Guardians. Trees of Dread protect their territory like their treant cousins. However, they use violence as their only means of solving conflict. They are extremely unpredictable and dangerous. When they gather in groups, they often overwhelm their opponents. A herd of these fey are a terrifying sight to behold.

    <description>The river troll is an absolutely massive type of troll. These huge trolls make their homes in lakes and rivers. They hunt for prey and will attempt to drown their victims. Unlike other trolls, these monsters refuse to serve anyone else.

At Home in the Water. Although they are huge in size, river trolls are actually quite good swimmers. They are also amphibious and use this trait to surprise their victims. River trolls can hide on the bottom of large rivers or lakes for hours.

Deadly Drownings. These horrid monsters are extremely strong and can usually drown their opponents. River trolls can also do extensive damage to objects and structures.

Fears Fire. Attacking the river troll with fire is the only way to stop them from regenerating.

    <description>The black unicorn is an example of how the dark fey are a twisted version of reality. This evil monster is the opposite of its celestial cousin. At home in enchanted forests, it stalks its prey. This fey's dark form and high level of awareness help it hunt in the shadows.

Toxic Horns. The black unicorn's white horn is a deadly tool of evil. Not only can the monster spear a victim, it does necrotic damage as well. Using dark magic, the black unicorn can also spray poison with the horn.

Evil Mounts. At times, powerful evil beings work alongside these monsters. There are stories of anti-paladins, evil arch fey, hags, or even witches riding on these dark steeds.

    <description>The green unicorn partners with other creatures to protect the woods. This unicorn moves almost unseen through the forest world. Legend says that certain druids are chosen by the gods and reincarnated as green unicorns. These creatures are also known to ally themselves with druids to fend off enemies. A circle of druids who ally with a green unicorn becomes a formidable foe. Chaotic neutral in nature, this unicorn is wary of good and evil creatures.

Deeply Connected. The green unicorn is deeply in touch with the forest. Other animals often ally with green unicorns to protect their territory. These fey know the woods better than any other creature.

Mounting a Challenge. Some neutral druids use these unicorns as mounts.

    <description>The red unicorn has been corrupted by demons. They live in enchanted forests and attack any good-hearted creatures that attempt to enter. At times, these monsters ally themselves with other evil creatures.

Fiery Horns. The red unicorn's black horn is a deadly tool of evil. Not only can the monster spear a victim, they do fire damage as well. Using dark magic, the horn can send out magical fire bolts at will. Evil spellcasters and alchemists attempt to gain red unicorn horns for use in spells and potions.

Hot-Tempered. These unicorns are violent and cruel beings. Unlike other unicorns, they are not stealthy and always make their presence known. They are not suitable as mounts as their bodies are dangerously hot.

    <description>The wilder, untamed cousin of the wizard is the witch. Witches can be any kind of humanoid and any gender. They often have familiars with them. The witch's alignment affects what kind of creature will serve them.

Two Paths. Witches can take one of two paths. There are only good and evil witches.

Spellbooks. As with wizards, witches keep all their spells in a spellbook. If the spellbook is destroyed, so is their ability to cast spells. However, witches can also continue to add spells to their repertoire if they have their spellbooks.

Bewitched Brooms. Most witches use magical brooms to fly around. They can travel double their speed when mounted on their brooms.

    <description>The witch king is one of the most powerful creatures in all of the land. This evil monster is the right-hand man of the Queen of Darkness. If the queen of the Unseelie Court has a mission, she calls on the witch king first. He is pure chaos and pure evil. Most creatures flee when this evil lord arrives on the scene. His badly scarred face is hidden beneath an intimidating helm.

Sky Castle. The witch king makes the Fortress of Shade his home, when he's not on errands for the queen. He lives in one of the highest towers of the floating castle.

Multiple Minions. This dark fey is able to call on the might of the Unseelie Court and has many minions. Undead monsters and a number of evil fey accompany this dark lord.

Mounting Darkness. The witch king usually rides a nightmare or a black unicorn. At times, he has even been known to take a dragon as a mount.
