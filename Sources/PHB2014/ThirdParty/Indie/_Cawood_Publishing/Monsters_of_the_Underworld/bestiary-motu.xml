    <description>Lurking in subterranean pools, rivers, and lakes is this deadly monstrosity. In the dark, murky underground water its not easy to see what lives below. Legendary tales warn adventurers to stay away from these underground bodies of water where the cave hydra might dwell.

Lone Lurker. It lives a solitary existence, waiting patiently for prey to wander by. This predator can survive a long time without feeding, but when prey arrives it boldly attacks. Despite their size, these monsters can move quickly on land or in the water.

Armed to the Teeth. The cave hydra uses its many tentacles to attack multiple targets. If possible, it will pull victims into its massive jaws and swallow them.

    <description>Wood splinters in all directions as the doors of a drow wilderness manor are destroyed. Rushing forward are muscled dwarves with battering rams. Dwarf crashers are at the front of many assaults by the dwarf army. Many other dwarves don't get along with these aggressive soldiers.

Explosive Entrance. Crashers are armed with battering rams and spears. The battering rams are used to smash into buildings or drive headlong into masses of enemy troops. Spears are strapped on the backs of these warriors.

Bearded Blockade. Not only can the crashers smash their way forward, they are also able to block opponents from moving. Getting past these dwarves is a very difficult task.

Dour Demeanor. These warriors are known to be very sober and have little sense of humor. Years of punishment has also left scars and many injuries on their stocky frames. Some compare the demeanor of dwarf crashers to their duergar cousins.

    <description>Being the most arrogant of an arrogant race says a lot. Drow nobles really do think they're the greatest thing under the sun. Very far under the sun.

Elf Leadership. These nobles join with the priestesses to make up the leadership of the drow. Most are female and part of the matriarchy that rules all the dark elves. They reside in elegant stone manors hollowed out from huge stalagmites or stalactites. Many drow are under their command and they have considerable influence.

House Elves. Drow nobles are the heads of noble houses made up of the most powerful families. They rule with a cruel hand and scheme to bring other houses into ruin.

Hellish Horses. Many of these nobles use nightmares as their mounts.

      <text>The fungi worm exhales dark spores in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constituion saving throw, or take 55 (10d10) poison damage and be poisoned for 1 hour. On a success the target takes half damage and is not poisoned. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target also falls unconscious while poisoned in this way. The target regains consciousness if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to wake it up.</text>

    <description>Evil has spread into the multiverse and takes form in many ways. The Undervoid is part of this evil, a toxic pool of energy deep in the Underworld. It is a massive being with huge tentacles rising out of the central pool.

Brilliant Mind. This aberration and its dark spores are highly intelligent. They seek to spread out and conquer the underground and surface worlds. Other pools of dark energy are also active throughout the multiverse.

Sowing Discontent. Evil spores are constantly being sent out by this strange aberration. Clouds of spores and many infected minions can be traced back to the Undervoid.

Prophetic End. Some seers have had visions of heroes traveling to the faraway home of this aberration and discovering its source in order to destroy it.

If the giant takes 30 or more damage on a single turn from a creature inside it, the giant must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 5 feet of the giant. If the giant dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.</text>

    <description>The deep gnome elders are the part of the svirfneblin leadership. Even the king seeks their advice at times. These wise svirfneblin are usually found clad in black and gray robes, clutching their handy quarterstaff.

Earth Knowledge. These elders have deep relationships with elementals from the Elemental Plane of Earth. They can even summon an elemental to assist them.

Quality Control. More than any other svirfneblin, the elders have an eye for quality gemstones. Younger deep gnomes always have elders examine their gemstones to determine their quality.

Caterpillar Mounts. Some deep gnome elders ride around on giant caterpillars or armored caterpillars.

    <description>Svirfneblin rangers patrol the borders of their territory. They are the first defense if one of their hidden enclaves is attacked. In some cases, these hardy gnomes are sent on missions deep into enemy territory. Svirfneblin rangers are some of the only deep gnomes who aren't afraid of the dark elves. They will courageously engage any drow they come into contact with.

Blending In. More than any other deep gnome, these warriors are able to blend into the surroundings. Drow have reported that the svirfneblin seem to appear out of thin air.

Crossbow Experts. Unlike other deep gnomes, the rangers are armed with light crossbows. The bolts are tipped with a strong poison. These gnomes learned how to poison their bolts after numerous encounters with the drow.

Old Gnomes Club. All svirfneblin rangers are male. However, a few female warriors have petitioned the king to have this tradition changed. Due to the patriarchal structure of their society, this petition has little chance to persuade the monarch.

    <description>Legends tell of a brave knighthood that makes forays into the Underworld to vanquish evil. These disciplined warriors are known as the Illuminai. Their holy light shines even in the darkest corners of this dangerous land.

Divine Vision. Since they spend so much time in the dark, these knights have been granted a divine boon of darkvision. Their deities are aware these brave souls must be able to find their way around the subterranean land.

Holy Horses. These knights often ride winged celestials known as night steeds (page 83). They are distant cousins of the pegasi and are able to see in the dark.

Shining Swords. Illuminai are armed with two unique weapons to deal with their evil opponents. Both their sword of light and bow of light are divine instruments.

    <description>While there aren't many lycanthropes in this strange land, there is a mighty werewolf lord. The werewolf lord lives in a hidden underground lair far from the eyes of surface-dwellers. He uses this stronghold to launch attacks and plot against the world above. Many years ago, this lycanthrope was actually a wealthy noble. However, he was bitten by a werewolf and fled underground.

Lunatic Lord. A special tower gives this monster a view of the moon on clear nights. At times, this has allowed access to unwanted visitors. Some creatures have found their way into the underground realm through this tower. However, those that encounter this lycanthrope are never seen again.

Subterranean Sounds. The eerie howl of the werewolf lord might be the last sound someone hears. It sends victims running for their lives. As creatures attempt to flee, this lycanthrope is known to hunt them down for sport.

We are Family. Some lycanthropes come to live in the werewolf lord's lair. Werewolves are the most common resident, but there are other lycanthropes as well. It is made very clear to any newcomers that the werewolf lord is in charge.

    <description>A cold, high voice laughs in the darkness. Small creatures flee the area and brush past your legs. Something sinister is out there. Emerging from the dark is a feminine form. This beautiful fey is an underworld dryad.

Friend of the Fungi. The underworld dryad is formed when a lost spirit is bound to a large mushroom by a powerful evil fey. If the mushroom is ever destroyed the spirit is free to pass on its journey to the next realm.

Gorgeous Guardians. Underworld dryads work with evil fey to protect fungi forests. Legends tell of these fey making use of their extraordinary beauty.

Mushroom Home. The mushroom home of the underworld dryad can be destroyed (AC 15, 35 hit points, immune to poison). If it is, the fey's form is destroyed and the mushroom disappears. However, these homes are well hidden deep inside fungi forests.
