    <description>Living in tiny homes and hollow trees in the woods are the smallest of fey. Although they're small in stature, atomies can be found in large numbers throughout Everwood. These creatures are the most populous group of wild fey in Feyland.

  Ancient Roots. Atomies have lived in Feyland since it came into existence. There is evidence of their presence for thousands of years. The ruins of old atomie villages are scattered across the land.

  Wild Fey. These fey don't belong to the Seelie or the Unseelie courts. Many atomies aren't pleased with either court and feel the wild fey are being ignored.

  All is not Well. The legendary Well of Dreams is sacred to atomies. It is a source of power that not many fey understand. Atomies are aware something has happened to the well and a scouting party has begun a journey to the Ivory Tower.

    <description>Growing throughout Everwood are giant, magical flowers. These plants are brightly colored and smell wonderful. Most fey believe spells were used to bring the flowers to life.

Talk Stalk. Awakened flowers are very talkative and they are easy to notice. However, conversations with these plants can drag on for hours. Sometimes they will also break out into song.

Potent Poison. The pollen from awakened flowers has the power to put creatures to sleep. It's not unusual to find beasts and fey sleeping nearby.

Alchemical Additions. Some alchemists will use these plants in their potions. Sleep potions and other concoctions can be created from awakened flowers.

    <description>Climbing over a log, newcomers to Feyland discover a small unconscious faerie. The adventurers take the creature back to their camp and look after her. A few hours later they discover they've been robbed and the faerie is gone.

Manipulative Maiden. The corrupted brownie queen is not what she appears to be. Using her good looks and charm, she takes advantage of whoever she can. She spends much of her time turning other brownies to the dark side.

Shady Lady. This creature likes to venture out at night under the cover of darkness. She will also turn invisible and sneak into strangers' camps.

Hidden Home. The corrupted brownie queen lives in a secret hollow tree in the central part of Everwood. She knows every inch of the forest and will use this to her advantage.

    <description>Everflowers used to be members of the Seelie Court as they are followers of the arch fey Orchid. However, when Orchid (page 115) joined the rival court the everflowers joined her.

On the Edge. Everflowers now live near the northern border of Feyland. They report what they find to the Unseelie Court. Much of the time the dancers put on performances in Everwood or Whims Town. However, these events are just a cover for their covert activities.

Popular Performers. Many other fey enjoy the everflowers' dances and there are hundreds of loyal fans. Most of the rumors about the dancers' questionable activities are ignored.

    <description>One of the guardians on the Feyland border is the edge walker. These creatures patrol the boundaries of Everwood where it meets the continent of Naern and the World of Myrr.

Border Guard. Edge walkers are followers of the good Seelie Court and usually report to fey rangersMOF or faun commanders (page 17). If any creatures cross into Feyland they warn them to act responsibly or return to their world.

Arboreal Ambush. The edge walker can blend into the forest very well. They've lived in the forest all their life and know every inch of the land. Intruders are often surprised by edge walkers before they know they've entered Feyland.

    <description>One of the most common creatures in Feyland is the faun. They are half-humanoid, half-goat and often get mistaken for satyrs. Fauns are much more responsible and not as wild as their satyr cousins.

Agile Fey. A whole troop of fauns racing through the woods is a sight to behold. These creatures are quick and nimble and can cover a great deal of territory in a short period of time.

Good Citizens. The horned faun is an honorable creature. They see the good in others and want to make Feyland a better place for everyone.

Seelie Soldiers. Fauns make up the bulk of the ground troops in the Seelie army. They are loyal to the king and queen and work well in large groups.

    <description>The General is the leader of an evil army of Stonefeet halfings from the continent of Naern. He has crossed over into Feyland to learn about the history of their arch enemy, the high elves.

Fiendish Halfling. Grim halfling scouts (page 19) have discovered the ancient ruins of the elves. The devil-worshipping general is interested in discovering what he can about his enemies.

War Footing. The high elf kingdom of Suhn has been surprised by the halflings' attacks on their territory. The General is planning to return to Naern shortly and continue the war.

Grim Guard. A dozen evil halfling monks serve as bodyguards for the General. They are known as the Stonefists. Two halfling wizards are also part of his entourage.

    <description>A quartet of halflings hide behind a large tree and watch a couple of mounted elves. The small scouts aim their bows and unleash four poisoned arrows towards the riders.

On the Borderlands. Leading the grim halflings' assault on the Kingdom of Suhn are the these halfling scouts. The Stonefeet have crossed into Feyland to learn more about their elf enemies.

Fiendish Plot. Devils who lured the General into an evil contract are tracking the halflings' movements. The small folk have no idea that the fiends are using them for their own purposes.

Jarog Rider. Most of these scouts ride jarogsMOF, a breed of aggressive war dog.

    <description>Deep inside Everwood, a beautiful light shines in the dark. The most powerful of all the unicorns in Feyland lives here. A golden lunacorn with a stunning rainbow horn helps guard the entrances to Feyland.

Force for Good. Lunacorns are in the service of the Seelie Court and fight all forms of evil. Dark fey usually retreat if they know these formidable unicorns are on their way.

Holding Court. Several lunacorns are based at the Great Tree, the home of the Seelie Court. They often accompany Queen Titania and serve as one of the many layers of protection surrounding her.

Stoic Sentinels. With the war underway, many lunacorns have been tasked with eliminating evil thresholders. The dark fey who guard a number of portals are being picked off one by one. Taking their places are lunacorns who decide who enters or leaves Feyland.

    <description>An adventuring party reaches a peaceful clearing deep in Everwood. They've tracked a turquoise dragon and have it in their sights. Suddenly the dragon disappears into thin air.

Shifty Character. These monsters are always on the move. Their ability to move in and out of Feyland enables them to outsmart many opponents.

Mind Games. Never dragons are highly intelligent and devise complicated strategies to steal treasure and gain power. They even study tactics they read about in ancient texts.

Never Lairs. Most never dragons live in expansive caves deep inside Everwood. Their sparkling treasure hoards are the only source of light in these cavernous lairs.

Nature Lover. These creatures are deeply connected to the forest and will do anything to protect it. They blend into the surroundings and seem to vanish into the wilds.

Free to Act. Nixies are wild fey and not a part of either the Seelie or Unseelie courts. They are worried about the war and will try to sabotage both courts' plans.

Love at First Sight. Some nixies fall in love with a creature that trespasses in their forest. The attractive fey will do anything to persuade the newcomer to stay with them forever.

    <description>A dark figure wanders through the ancient ruins of the elves. He waves his hand and rubble is cleared from the entrance to an old tomb. Speaking in a long-lost tongue he uses arcane magic to unlock the forgotten building.

Fey Necromancer. Phineas Gloom is the most powerful necromancer in all of Feyland. He has been sent by the Unseelie Court to disrupt the Seelie Court's activities in Everwood.

Ruined Soul. Eternally depressed, this necromancer is a pathetic creature. His pessimistic nature can get the better of him.

Unseemly Unseelie. Phineas is one of the Skeleton King's favorite minions from the Autumn Court. The gloomy spellcaster plans to use his time in Everwood to gather undead for the arch fey's army.

    <description>Living underneath Everwood is a horrifying monster. The Root of All Evil is one of the most powerful creatures in the land of the Fey. This plant can take on entire armies by itself.

Underground World. The monster has made a series of tunnels underneath the forest that lead to a massive cavern. This is its hidden, labyrinthine lair.

Abandonment Issues. The fey in Everwood make sure to stay away from the plant's territory. This part of the woods is considered cursed.

Survival Game. The Root of All Evil is omnivorous, living on anything it can find in Everwood: bears, deer, and elk, as well as many kinds of plants.

    <description>Scattered across Feyland are numerous ancient standing stones. Most of them can be found near the elf ruins in Everwood.

Ancient Guardian. These stones are actually elementals that were created when Feyland came to life thousands of years ago. They were fashioned to guard the world from intruders.

Alignment Matters. Standing stones used to be chaotic good and keep out evil creatures. They are able to magically scan creatures and read their alignment.

Stonewalled. However, since the Well of Dreams has been corrupted some stones have other alignments, even evil ones. This has caused all kinds of chaos as the stones have begun to attack many of the inhabitants of Everwood.

    <description>Most elf ancestors crossed over from Feyland into the continent of Naern thousands of years ago. However, some were left behind. Upon their deaths, a group of them cursed the elves who had left them behind. These are the callous twisted elven ghosts.

Eternal Anger. These creatures have never let go of the anger that surfaced so long ago. They hate all elves and will do anything to destroy them.

Halfling Allies. The halfling general has reached out to the elven ghosts and they are meeting to discuss further plans. He has led a group of the Stonefeet halflings deep into the Everwood to negotiate with the undead elves.

Undead Nature. A twisted elf ghost doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>The elite force of high elf rangers in Myrr and Naern are known as the Whisperers. They have crossed over into Feyland hunting for the Stonefeet halflings and their infamous leader, the General.

Silent Partners. These elves are known for their stealth. They seem to move through the land with surprising grace. Whisperers get their names from this ability to move quietly and quickly.

Resourceful Rangers. These rangers never give up and usually find a way to complete their covert missions. They are highly skilled and train for years before joining the ranks of the most famous rangers in the World of Myrr.

Unicorn Riders. Most Whisperers use unicorns as their mounts.

    <description>The Seelie Court uses cloud guards to protect this region. These mounted warriors are garrisoned in a couple of mountain keeps. They are famous for their bold nature and magical light swords.

Air Cavalry. Cloud guards usually patrol the mountain region on hippogriffs. Their faithful mounts are stabled in the cloud guards' keeps.

Highly Trained. From a young age, these fey are trained in melee and ranged combat. They are exceptional warriors and can even handle multiple opponents.

Centaur Rivals. Even though cloud guards often work with flying centaurs, there is a rivalry. Both groups are jockeying to be the lead force in the Seelie Court's war with the Unseelie Court.

    <description>The duchess has been corrupted and has joined the Academy as a scholar. She has no qualifications or expertise to be an academic, but that doesn't matter in the current climate. Her husband shares a home with her at the heart of the region. Their mighty castle dwarfs most other structures in the area.

Waging War. This cold, cruel fey has been tasked to lead the Academy's forces in the mountains. The duchess has evil giants, misty mountain hoppers, wind maidens, and other minions at her command.

Sleep Tight. Entering the dreams of other beings is her expertise. She will mine dreams to find ways to manipulate others. For years she has gathered information from her enemies.

Unhappily Ever After. The duchess' marriage to Duke Cloudmuddle is a disaster. He has just realized that she had him under a spell and he is beginning to get his bearings. She knows that her days of dealing with a fool are over.

Lost Boy. For years the loyal duke worshipped the duchess and didn't see her dark side. Over time he lost himself in one of her nightmares. Without telling him, the duchess used his hookah to drug him.

Handy Hookah. He has his precious hookah with him at all times. Now that he knows it was bewitched, he has put it back in working order.

Clear Eyes. The duke is finally beginning to see what has been right in front of his eyes. His wife is an evil manipulator and he has been a fool.

    <description>Fog pours out from atop a mountain. It doesn't seem to stop and a couple of faeries stop to watch. Inside the huge cloud of fog is a mysterious spellcaster named Father Fog.

Shady Character. He wanders the Sugarwind Mountains and uses his magic to break into castles and wilderness manors. The old fey robs other creatures by hiding in his large fog cloud.

Ruined Home. This spellcaster makes his home in an old ruined castle. The building is located on one of the many floating islands in the Sugarwind Mountains.

Like a Bird. Father Fog isn't a winged creature but he can still fly by using magic. It's a spectacular sight to see the wizened fey flying through the air with his dark cloak blowing in the wind.

    <description>Without warning a heavy boulder is tossed at a flying goblin. The floating island nearby has suddenly come to life. Several of these islands in the Sugarwind Mountains are actually elementals. It's almost impossible to tell which is a living creature and which is simply a floating landmass.

Living Landscape. These monsters are usually very still but can awaken at any moment. Like other parts of Feyland, this region is an unpredictable environment.

Hidden Hosts. Some fey build castles or other structures on these islands, not knowing they are living creatures. In some parts of the Sugarwind Mountains, entire villages have been constructed on these elementals.

Moving Along. At times, a floating island will simply float away into another region. Some of the elementals have floated right through Riftgates into other worlds.

    <description>Numerous arrows split the air and race towards a cloud giant. The massive monster is balanced perilously on a rope bridge as the projectiles hit its chest. Then the attackers, a group of flying centaurs, soar upwards and unleash a second barrage of arrows.

Airborne Cavalry. These winged fey make up the bulk of the air force for the Seelie Court. A number of them are stationed at the Great Tree, the home of the good fey.

Deadly Archers. Skilled at using bows, the flying centaurs can be a formidable force in large numbers. When they team up against an enemy, they are very difficult to handle.

Secluded Stables. Although they can be found throughout Feyland, these creatures are based in mountain stables. The Seelie Court has cloud guards protecting these remote outposts.

    <description>Lightning flashes through the air and thunder soon follows. Illuminated in the midst of the storm is a large flying snail. It blasts fire rays from its eye stalks and then spits slime at a couple of flying centaurs.

Great Gastropod. Even in Feyland, this creature draws a lot of attention. Their slime is prized by fey alchemists as it is a powerful acid. Some of the members of the Unseelie Court use it on their arrows.

Sky Life. Gale snails spend most of their time hunting for food in the skies. They usually eat birds and other smaller flying creatures.

Island Locals. The odd creatures grow up on the isolated flying islands and aren't usually found in other parts of Feyland. Alchemists from other parts of the world will explore the mountains looking for the valuable snails.

    <description>A party of adventurers flies through the mountains on an ancient gold dragon. They spot a lanky creature standing on a low cloud. The newcomers can't believe their eyes.

Walking on Air. Believe it or not mist walkers appear to be walking on air. When they're first taught to use their powers, they never thought they could feel so free.

Mind the Gap. With their ability to move through the air, these fey find the Sugarwind Mountains a perfect place to call home. Some live with other dark fey in small settlements, others live in hidden caves.

Blown Away. In addition to several spells, mist walkers also use a blow gun. Their darts are quite unusual and have a number of different effects.

New Recruits. They have recently joined the evil Academy faction of the Unseelie Court. A large number of them are under the command of the Duchess of Dreams.

Spring in Their Step. The misty mountain hoppers know the area like the back of their appendages. They can act as very useful guides in the dynamic environment.

Fey Fiddler. These fey also make music by rubbing their long legs together. The sound is almost identical to a fiddle and can charm those who hear it. As a troop of them move around they often compose songs.

    <description>A miniscule sailing ship flies through the clouds amongst the Sugarwind Mountains. On board are thirty tiny pirate faeries, troublemakers from the Unseelie Court.

Beautiful Buccaneers. Pirate faeries are very attractive scoundrels who seek to fill their lairs with treasure. They are notorious for their bold and brash attitudes.

Cunning Captain. Their captain is a male pirate faerie named Thad. He is well-liked by the hundreds of pirate faeries in Feyland.

Treasure Island. Hidden on a distant island is the clandestine lair of these pirates. Several flying ships are based here, far away from most fey. The treasure hoard in their castle is gigantic.

Rainbow's End. These dragons create rainbows when they awaken. Those who live in the mountains know that the beautiful arcs mean danger. Rainbows will always appear near the creatures' lairs.

Slippery Serpent. Even though they are quite large, these monsters are very agile. Rainbow serpents can turn quickly and avoid many attacks.

Magnificent Mounts. A few dark fey use rainbow serpents as mounts. The dragons will bond with other evil creatures and stay in their service for years.

    <description>Calm and polite, this scholar is known to be extremely charming. However, under the surface she is a seductive trickster. The Spring Scholar makes her home in the mountains when she's not at the Academy.

Academic Mouthpiece. Of the four lead scholars, the Spring Scholar is the most diplomatic. However, she is a ruthless individual who simply craves power.

Big Plans. The scholar is under orders to meet with the Duchess of Dreams and help coordinate the Academy's next move. However, she doesn't think much of the haughty duchess.

Mountain Home. The scholar has recently returned from the Academy and made many changes to her mountain castle. A large contingent of flying goblins has arrived to bolster the forces of the Unseelie Court.

    <description>Floating through the misty mountains of Feyland are gigantic whales. Their deafening thunder calls can be heard for miles around. Sky whales are wild fey and aren't members of the Seelie or Unseelie courts.

Cloud Creatures. These fey feel at home amongst towering mountains and low clouds. Sky whales are quite courageous and won't back down in any confrontation.

Mobile Mount. These enormous creatures serve as mounts for some fey. They'll even agree to be pack animals if the deal is right.

Interior Life. If a creature is swallowed by these behemoths, it isn't necessarily the end of the line. Once inside the belly of whale, creatures can still survive.

Pleasure Seeker. Known for their sweet smell, they are extremely gregarious. Sugar dragons usually have many allies in the region, including a number of dark fey.

Dragon Delights. They are quite playful and enjoy themselves to the fullest. However, they won't hesitate to use violence to get what they want. Their treasure hoards are usually filled with colorful gemstones and any items with unusual tastes or smells.

Soft Spoken. Sugar dragons have syrupy, gentle voices. There is something very unsettling about their patient, soft speech.

Winged Warrior. The evil Academy has sent these nasty fey to help gain air superiority in the Sugarwind Mountains. They have been tasked to eliminate any creature that doesn't fall in line.

Cleansing Quest. There are a number of wind maidens based in a wilderness manor controlled by the Academy. It is located on one of the many floating islands in the region.

Big Problems. Wind maidens are having challenges trying to convince the giants to join their cause. The Mountain Lord and his minions aren't enamored with the Academy.

    <description>Suddenly part of a floating island gives way and large pieces of rock plummet downwards. Up above several small creatures continue to eat their way through solid rock. Wobble gobbles cause a great deal of damage as they move through the world.

Big Mouth. These little monsters have an insatiable appetite and have altered the shape of the mountains. They can even destroy floating islands, disable rope bridges, and cause rockslides.

Home Wreckers. Shocked by the damage caused by these creatures, the Seelie Court has sent fey rangers to hunt them down. Many of the tiny fey have been eliminated but their numbers are huge.

Winged Wonders. Many fey believe elven cats and flutterbies (page 54) are the most splendid creatures in all of Feyland. The patterns on both creatures' wings are extraordinary.

Magnificent Mounts. There are some very small fey that will ride elven cats. Atomies and brownies and other faeries enjoy these trips. It's not uncommon to see the tiny fey riding the flying cats around the Great Tree.

Court Hawk. Faegar is pleased war has finally broken out and the fate of Feyland will be decided. He is very involved in the military planning with the Oak Lord.

Bold and the Beautiful. The handsome winged fey believes in taking swift action. He doesn't appreciate the patient approach of most of the Seelie Court's leadership. However, the Oak Lord sees eye-to-eye with him.

Love Interest. Faegar has fallen in love with Victoria Van Vamp (page 68). She barely acknowledges him, but he would do anything for her.

    <description>An adventuring party catches a glimpse of a large butterfly-like creature racing through the trees. They pursue the flutterby to see where it goes. It flies higher and higher and heads towards the largest tree they've ever seen.

Wondrous Wings. The beauty of the flutterby is breathtaking. Many fey are enthralled by the creature's spectacular wings.

Sky Riders. A number of the Seelie Court use the flutterbies as mounts. Golden knights are known to have many of the flying fey in their service. Flutterbies aren't just beautiful, they can also blast rays from their antennae.

    <description>Several winter faeries stalk a giant hummingbird. They expect the beast will be an easy target. Just then the bright, green creature sprays them with acidic nectar. The evil faeries scream and take to the sky.

Blurred Beast. Among the fastest creatures in the land is the stunning giant hummingbird. Most fey just see a blur as the beast races past. Some tiny fey will ride on the friendly beasts.

Generous Gardeners. Giant hummingbirds spend much of their time tending to the splendid gardens that surround the Great Tree. It's their favorite place in all of Feyland.

    <description>The purest of the fey are the glimmerlings. They are so powerful that their bodies are filled with radiant light. When they arrive on the scene, good fey are inspired and uplifted.

Tree Guard. Many of the glimmerlings remain at the Great Tree to protect the home of the Seelie Court. They usually patrol the interior areas of the beloved tree.

Night Shift. These extraordinary creatures don't sleep and watch over the Seelie headquarters through the night. Their glowing light illuminates the halls and staircases of the Great Tree.

Deep Connection. Glimmerlings are deeply connected to the healing trees (page 60) that grow around the region. Some fey believe the glowing beings were created by the astonishing plants.

    <description>The elite knights of Feyland are golden knights. They usually protect the highest-ranking members of the Seelie Court. It is easy to identify them by their astonishing golden armor.

Legendary Loyalty. These knights will sacrifice themselves to protect those around them. They are the epitome of bravery and loyalty.

Home Tree. Most of the knights are based at the Great Tree with the regular fey knightsMOF. However, some of these knights are sent around Feyland to help the court on other missions.

Flutterby Mounts. The majority of golden knights ride flutterbies as their mounts.

    <description>Seated beside the king and queen is a massive owl. She spends most of her time listening and watching the proceedings. Grandmother Owl is part of the leadership of the good fey court.

Ancient Wisdom. She is the embodiment of unconditional love. Her warmth invigorates every creature she meets. This astonishing being doesn't judge others, she even has time to listen to members of the Unseelie Court.

Nesting Place. Grandmother Owl is almost always in the throne room. Although she does head out late at night to fly around the region.

Early Bird. This fey was there when Feyland was born from the Well of Dreams. She remembers everything that has happened since. No other fey has the deep knowledge that she does.

    <description>Growing all around the Great Tree are these lovely plants. They are the children of the mother tree and will do anything to protect her. Their warm, golden light seems almost otherworldly.

Light the Way. These trees help illuminate the Seelie Court's home during the night. One of the most beautiful sights in all of Feyland are these glowing trees surrounding the central tree in the dark.

Healing the World. Incredibly, these trees have the ability to heal. Their radiant energy can mend wounds and help keep the community safe.

    <description>A graceful fey climbs one of the many staircases in the Great Tree. Her stunning white dress trails behind her as she leads a dozen golden knights up into the heart of the tree.

Pure Power. The lady is made of pure power, the same energy that is in the Well of Dreams. Being in her presence feels like being in the warmth of the sun.

Court Advisor. King Oberon and Queen Titania are known to lead the Seelie Court. However, the Lady of the Light has a strong influence on them. She is their mentor and trusted counsel.

Good Instincts. She doesn't question her instincts as she is fully aware of who and what she is. The lady is a close ally of Grandmother Owl. They see eye-to-eye on almost everything.

Capable Heroine. Lost maidens are not to be underestimated; they can look after themselves quite well. They are intelligent, skilled and rather brave. However, many of the female fey are jealous of all the attention the newcomers receive.

Long Journey. Returning to the Material Plane is not a simple undertaking. There are Riftgates and many kinds of portals that lead back. However, finding these can be an adventure in itself. Unless they are dealing with Jaeden, a lost maiden might also have to offer something in return for a pathway home.

    <description>This demi-human was born after Oswald Myrr had an affair with Queen Titania. Even though King Oberon and Queen Titania decided to remain together, they welcomed the feisty half-elf into their family. Scarlett grew up around the Seelie Court and Feyland is her home. She is a fiercely independent ranger.

Famous Father. Scarlett's father is the Wizard of Zogg, a man known across the multiverse. She knows of Oswald Myrr's mistakes and wants to help make the world a better place.

Quest for the Well. A number of wise fey in court believe that it is vital to locate the Well of Dreams. Scarlett has been chosen to lead this mission.

Adventuring Party. The Seelie Court have sent a trio of fey rangers and a spellcaster with the young woman. It is hoped the small band of heroes will locate the legendary well.

Elder Emissary. The Elder Tree has two emissaries it sends around Feyland, the Snake of Life and the Neverever Beast (page 102). Both creatures bring his message of peace and offer counsel for other fey.

Powerful Message. When the snake speaks, every- one listens to every word he says. The creature radiates power and is a force of nature. It will bring up any concerns from the Elder Tree.

    <description>A group of cowardly goblins are making their way towards the Great Tree. Without warning, a cloaked figure appears out of thin air. Before they have a chance to reach for their swords, the attacker unleashes a quarterstaff. Spinning around, its cloak fluttering in the breeze, the stranger drops the goblins to the ground.

Long Arm of the Court. Steppers allow the Seelie Court to reach into the most remote parts of Feyland. They are skilled enough to deal with almost anything.

Shock and Awe. These fey act quickly and decisively. Steppers teleport to their destination and get to work immediately. They are supremely confident and don't second guess themselves.

True Leaders. Steppers are based at the Great Tree and rank higher than many of the other fey in the court. They set an example for others and are highly respected by the king and queen.

    <description>Victoria is leading a double life. She appears to be a beautiful, charming member of the Seelie Court. In truth she is a cunning spy working for the Unseelie Court. She is not actually from Feyland and is related to the sinister Count Batty who lives in the Darklands.

Narcissistic Nightmare. The attractive fey has become obsessed with her beauty and has lost her way. Victoria carries a small mirror and constantly checks her appearance. She received a lot of attention when she was young and it has gone to her pretty head.

Court Favorites. Many fey in the Great Tree find the wild corgis to be delightful. Queen Titania has half a dozen of them in her quarters.

Mischievous Monsters. However, there is another side to these charming corgis. They are greedy and independent. Wild corgis get into all sorts of trouble in the Great Tree.

    <description>Hard at work in the Whims Town bakeries are skilled faeries. They never seem to stop baking and the kitchens are filled with them.

Salty Mouths. Baker faeries are known to be the most foul-mouthed faeries in Feyland. They've made up an entirely new vocabulary that most fey would rather never hear.

Popular Pastries. Their baking skills are the best in the land and their treats are highly sought after. Most baker faeries can make a lot of gold in Whims Town.

Eyes and Ears. In addition to baking delicious delights, these evil creatures also work for the Unseelie Court. Baker faeries spy on the inhabitants of the rowdy settlement and report to the dark court.

    <description>Bella Rose is convinced she's the most beautiful barmaid in all of Feyland. She is Shady Slim's (page 86) favored companion. Bella arrived in Feyland a year ago from the World of Myrr and decided to stay.

Femme Fatale. She often plays the victim and complains endlessly. In truth, the young half-elf is more than capable. She craves power and believes her relationship with Shady Slim will prove beneficial.

Terrible Temptress. Bella is greedy and incredibly vain. She wouldn't think twice about betraying Slim either. The half-elf is eager to visit the Fortress of Shade in the Darklands and meet more members of the evil court.

    <description>An explosion goes off and cherry juice covers the face of a badly injured customer. The last barmaid anyone should upset is Cherry Bomb. She doesn't put up with any kind of abuse from her customers.

Groovy Gal. Even though her reputation precedes her, she gets along with most of the inhabitants of Whims Town. The locals like the fact she speaks her mind and takes care of business.

Bombastic Fantastic. Shady Slim is in love with Cherry Bomb and constantly asks her to join his gang. He visits the Marshmellow Mushroom tavern on a daily basis.

Vacation Plans. The sassy barmaid met Count Batty (page 116) when he was in town recently. Cherry has made plans to travel to the Darklands and visit the charming fey.

    <description>One of the most famous individuals in all of Feyland is the Hatter. The strange character seems to have lost his mind and marches to his own drummer. He has been corrupted and has joined the Unseelie Court.

Mad World. Feyland has been turned upside down by the power unleashed from the Well of Dreams. The Hatter is reveling in the chaos and his new powers. Stunned at the sudden change, the Seelie Court is trying to figure out how to deal with this eccentric fellow.

Weaponized Wag. The dark court knows that unleashing the Hatter will result in pandemonium. He is on the loose, and nobody really knows what he'll do next.

Party People. The Hatter is holding wild tea parties all over the land of the Fey. He uses the parties to corrupt other fey and bolster the power of the Unseelie Court.

    <description>This outrageous creature is one of the lowest forms of life in Feyland. A nihilist who attempts to shock and offend. Most edgelords make their home in Whims Town, however some have travelled to the ordinary world.

Attention Seeker. Edgelords will do anything to be in the spotlight. They don't care about anyone else and will even use violence.

Inside Joke. None of the inhabitants of Whims Town take these fey seriously. They are considered unworthy of the attention they crave.

New Audience. A few edgelords have discovered Riftgates that can transport them to the Material Plane. They are eager to find creatures that are un- aware of their schemes.

He was one of the first creatures affected by the corruption of the Well of Dreams. Gene believes every fey should follow their most base desires. He's hard not to notice as he screams and bawls constantly.

Reptilian Smile. His sly, creepy smile makes most fey feel very uncomfortable. He won't admit it, but he considers himself to be superior to others.

Simple Minds. The genie views fey and humanoids as simpletons. He thinks that most of them are barely intelligent enough to make their way home each night.

Many Tastes. Gene will eat almost anything and fey often bring him strange meals. His diet includes peculiar fungi found in the Lush Wild.

Fast As You Can. Gingerbread men are extremely quick and agile tricksters. They cause mayhem wherever they go.

Fey Baking. These creatures are brought to life by baker faeries. However, the gingerbread men hate faeries because of this. They don't ever want to discuss how they were made.

    <description>The Puzzleman is an enigma wrapped in a riddle. He meanders around Whims Town, observing daily life. Most of the inhabitants of the busy settlement leave him alone.

Unique Fey. In a land of strange creatures, the Puzzleman is one of the most curious. Few of the fey in Whims Town know anything about him.

In Plain Sight. Using his remarkable ability to turn into objects, Puzzleman can hide almost anywhere. He likes to travel around town and watch all the action. To protect himself he can rearrange pieces of himself to dodge attacks. He can also slam pieces of his body into other creatures.

Piece of Mind. Most inhabitants say the real puzzle is what is going on in the fey's mind. What they don't understand is that his mind is completely empty. Puzzleman is fully present in the moment and has no agenda at all.

      <text>One humanoid that the self-doubt trout can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the trout; the trout then disappears, and the target is wracked by doubt for 1d4 minutes. The target makes all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks at disadvantage. The self-doubt trout can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead. The possession ends after that period of doubt or the trout is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the self-doubt trout reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to the trout's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.</text>
    </action>
    <description>The doubt trout is one of the oddest creatures in this realm. However, this undead monster is even more unusual. The self-doubt trout is created by a necromancer who finds a dead doubt trout.

Inside Job. The main goal of the self-doubt trout is to possess a creature and fill them with doubt. This occurs much like a ghost possessing a living being.

Blame Game. Some fey blame the elves for bringing these creatures to Feyland. They often refer to them as the elf doubt trout. This isn't true of course, it's because of necromancers like Phineas Gloom.

Undead Nature. A self-doubt trout doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>When a human dies in this strange land he can be raised as an undead creature by a necromancer. A number of these monsters wander Whims Town in the form of shadow men. At times it seems as if shadows are acting independently in the settlement, but it's actually these monsters moving about.

Unfinished Business. These undead confront visitors to Feyland and bring them all kinds of grief. They are jealous of anyone who is still alive and has the ability to return home. The foul monsters will harass any newcomers to Whims Town.

Undead Nature. A shadow man doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>Shady Slim is the most notorious gangster in Whims Town. For all intents and purposes, he is in charge of the settlement. He is calm, patient, and vicious. Slim is currently romantically involved with Bella Rose and his chief henchman is Cobweb Kelly.

Gangly Gangster. This tall fey stands out in a crowd, and that is saying a lot in Feyland. His odd hat can be seen from far away and his silhouette is rather unique.

Power Broker. Slim owns most of the taverns, inns, and shops in Whims Town. He will deal with any competition swiftly and in a brutal fashion.

Enchanted Manor. The foul gangster lives in a magical manor on the edge of town. Only he and his minions can gain access by an enchanted statue that stands on the grounds.

    <description>Sylvan spies usually work for the Seelie or Unseelie courts. Although some are in the service of wild fey like the Frog Witch (page 92) or the Mountain LordMOF. At times they gather information, other times they are simply assassins.

Arcane Rogue. Sylvan spies use a number of spells to fulfill their missions. They often use the disguise self spell when they go undercover.

Cunning Chameleons. These fey know Feyland well and can adapt to whatever region they find themselves in. They often have intricate backstories and some of their stories are even true.

Perpetual Pandemonium. Even if sylvan spies are in the service of one of the courts, they will sometimes act independently. A few of the spies are double agents, playing off both the Seelie and Unseelie factions.

    <description>One of the most creative creatures in all of Feyland is the Toymaker. His colorful workshop is located near the center of Whims Town. Many fey children grow up with his creations.

Gaming the System. The Toymaker is interested in spreading his toys around Feyland to gather information for the Unseelie Court. His constructs collect information on those who play with them.

Playing Around. He loves to experiment and is constantly building new toy constructs. Loud noises and strange smells emanate from his busy workshop.

    <description>A blurry creature races through Whims Town near the docks. Heads turn as the spritely fey moves like the wind. Zoomers are one of the messengers used by the inhabitants of Feyland.

Express Delivery. Zoomers are incredibly fast and most creatures simply see a blur when they pass them. Their lives are shorter than most fey and they plan to make the most of their time.

Independent Actors. These wild fey are free and don't belong to either court. They have no interest in the war that has broken out.

Moving On. Zoomers can live almost anywhere and are found throughout Feyland. Some live in trees, some in hollow logs, others will even hide in castles or manors.

    <description>Living in the Lush Wild is the horrid Frog Witch. She has recently been corrupted by the Well of Dreams. If those in Feyland thought she was a menace before, they haven't seen anything yet.

Big Ambitions. The patient Frog Witch used to be content ruling from her swamp in the Lush Wild. She has her eyes on a much larger prize now, believing she can use the war for her advantage and usurp the Unseelie Court. The cunning hag is now expanding her swamp and building an underwater town.

Leap Ahead. She has gained more power from the magical well and rivals the arch fey in her new form. The slimy villain has learned new spells and has enhanced her dangerous staff.

Swamp World. Not only does the notorious henchman known as the Toadman serve the witch, but many others have joined her cause. Giant frogs, giant toads, river trolls, strange fish, and many other creatures have rallied around her.

    <description>The swan maidens have also been corrupted by the Well of Dreams. These evil fey have joined the Unseelie Court. Although the Lady of the Swans remains with the Seelie Court, they have swapped sides.

Always Angry. Usually peaceful, these corrupted fey are now part of the war for Feyland. They are hostile and aggressive, nothing like their former selves.

Future is Female. These fey dislike male creatures of any kind and will attack them on sight.

Swan Mount. Corrupted swan maidens ride giant swans as their mounts.

    <description>Walking through the Lush Wild one must be prepared for the landscape to come to life. Hidden amongst the many giant mushrooms are darkshrooms. Some creatures wander into a large group of these plants and are never seen again.

Mighty Mushroom. These foul fungi will attack anything that gets close enough. They feed on those creatures that stray into the deepest part of the Lush Wild.

Waiting Game. Ambushing their victims can take time. However, the darkshrooms are patient and will wait motionless for hours.

    <description>The Frog Witch rides through the swamp on her giant frog mount. Her entourage stops to watch a frog dragon fly overhead. Then the strange winged monster dives into the murky waters of the Lazy River.

Water World. This bizarre dragon often swims through the Lush Wild hunting for food. It can dive down and spend hours below the surface eating fish and plants.

Social Distancing. Using their breath weapon from afar is a favorite tactic of the frog dragon. It will begin with this attack and then move in to use its jaws and tail.

Dragon's Lair. The frog dragon lives in a large dam-like structure it creates by using plants, mud, and anything else it can find.

    <description>The regular troops in the Frog Witch's newly created army are the frog knights. They guard the borders of the Lush Wild and patrol throughout the region.

Horrid Horde. These creatures will attempt to overwhelm opponents with much larger numbers. They don't usually travel in groups of less than half a dozen.

Construction Work. Recently a number of the frog knights have been enlisted by the witch to help create an underwater town. There has been some grumbling from the frogs who don't feel it should be their job.

Swamp Sprawl. As the Frog Witch builds her underwater town, she is using frog knights to move out the local populace. Many fey in the Lush Wild are upset with the witch and are ripe for a rebellion.

    <description>Travelling through Feyland are a number of brave adventurers. One of the most famous is Ginger Snap. She is enjoying her time in the whimsical realm and has adjusted rather quickly.

Gorgeous Guide. To make some gold, the warrior will guide visitors through the unpredictable landscape of the land of the Fey. She knows the lay of the land well, especially the Lush Wild.

Myrrly Visiting. She is planning to explore every part of Feyland and learn what she can. The inquisitive young woman plans to return home to the World of Myrr one day.

Sweet Ride. Ginger Snap has a loyal unicorn named Legend that she uses as a mount.

    <description>A patrol of frog knights makes its way through the Lush Wild. They're exhausted from their regular duties and working on the underwater town construction site. A gigantic creature suddenly rises out of the swamp and blasts its trumpet. The frogs are blown backwards by the Grootslang, flying onto some nearby giant lily pads.

The Elephant in the Swamp. The fey who live in the swamp don't even like to discuss this monster. They prefer not to mention it and stay far away. It's a well-known saying in Feyland, "Don't mention the elephant in the swamp".

Marsh Monster. Some fey believe that the Grootslang is an alien from another plane. There is a strong likelihood it came through a Riftgate.

Stone Sanctuary. The lair of the Grootslang is near an ancient circle of standing stones. No beasts live within miles of the monster's home.

    <description>This tiny flying creature can cause big problems in the Lush Wild. Luna ticks are found throughout the humid, swampy region. They are even found as far as Whims Town.

Bothersome Bug. These fey might be small but they pack a big punch. Luna ticks can even kill much larger creatures.

Blood Sucker. The horrible bugs drain blood from their victims. This can be a lethal attack for an unlucky visitor to the Lush Wild.

Patio Lanterns. Many fey trap luna ticks in containers and use them as a light source. Their golden light is the first warning sign that the pesky monsters are present.

    <description>A group of heroes cautiously makes its way down the Lazy River. Suddenly laughter echoes across the murky water. The last thing the adventurers ever see are large eyes piercing the surface of the river. 

Troublesome Terrain. Mockodiles are cruel, cunning creatures that like to surprise their victims. The Lush Wild gives them ample opportunity to do just that.

Horrid Hunter. Their powerful jaws can do a lot of damage and many creatures simply flee when the monsters arrive on the scene. The fey crocodiles are lethal killing machines.

Loquacious Lizard. Mockodiles enjoy teasing and toying with their victims. They use colorful language and will even recite poems or riddles.

    <description>One of the oldest creatures in Feyland is the Neverever Beast. Like the Snake of Life, it is closely allied with the Elder Tree. Some say it was created from the Well of Dreams when the world came to life.

Monstrous Messenger. Like the Snake of Life, the Neverever Beast acts on behalf of the Elder Tree and spreads its message of peace. The Neverever Beast is currently watching the activities of the Frog Witch.

Massive Statement. This sizeable creature is an intimidating presence and can take on either fey army singlehandedly. It prefers to act as a deterrent, but it will show its ferocious side if necessary.

    <description>One of the wild fey living in the Lush Wild is Pussywillow. She is a nasty piece of business and has no interest in having any intruders enter the swamp.

Witch Faction. Pussywillow is one of the Frog Witch's henchmen and will deal with any trespassers harshly. She lives in a giant pink mushroom near the witch's underwater town.

Quick Work. This fey is extremely aggressive and won't waste any time negotiating. Pussywillow's actions speak loudly, and she is an extremely confident individual.

    <description>Riverdancers live in and around the Lazy River. They are fey who spend much of their time dancing on water. Unlike most creatures they can actually walk on water.

Graceful Gang. The evil riverdancers appear to be quite lovely and elegant on the surface. In truth they are cruel killers.

Curtain Call. Many fey know that seeing the dance of the riverdancers might be the last thing they do. Other fey will avoid these thugs if they can.

Agents of the Court. Although they were wild fey, they've been corrupted by the Well of Dreams and joined the Unseelie Court. They act as spies and report back to Whims Town to contacts within the dark court.

    <description>This evil scholar has been sent to the Lush Wild to negotiate with the Frog Witch. The Academy and Unseelie Court want to bring the witch into the fold. They are willing to offer her almost anything she wants.

Fiery Fellow. This fey is an intense, hot-headed creature. He is extremely loyal and would do anything for the Academy and the Unseelie Court.

Temper Tantrums. The Scholar of Summer is renowned for his epic tantrums. Paint will peel from the walls of castles when he starts shouting and raving like a lunatic. More than any of the other scholars at the Academy he encourages his students to listen to their feelings and act on them.

Swamp Ruins. While this fey is in the Lush Wild, he and his minions are camping in a desolate ruin. None of them are pleased to be in the region but they'll do what they can for their cause.

    <description>To deal with the growing threat of the Frog Witch, the Seelie Court has dispatched scout faeries to the Lush Wild. These tiny fey are monitoring the witch's activities and report back to the Great Tree.

Surprising Strength. Scout faeries are often overlooked due to their size. However, this is a mistake; the small fey are more than capable. Unlike most fey they are rather serious and extremely focused.

Practical Magic. Agile and fast, these faeries are built to get in and out of enemy territory. They are also quite resourceful and can live almost anywhere.

Beast Buddies. Scout faeries get along with beasts and enjoy their company. These fey will enlist the help of many kinds of creatures from the wilderness.

    <description>Living in the swampy Lush Wild is a horrid group of undead. Humanoid creatures that got lost and died in this region are reanimated by necromancers like Phineas Gloom.

Muddy Waters. These swamp people live in the muddy, murky areas of the Lush Wild. Hundreds of them can be found throughout the swamp.

Dirty Work. Lurking in the gloomy terrain of this region, the swamp people will ambush their victims. As they're not living creatures, they can hide underwater or in the mud indefinitely.

Undead Nature. A swamp person doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

Martial Artists. Heavily built and skilled in hand-to-hand combat, these toads don't usually need weapons. Some locals have named them the Frog Monks.

Toadly Committed. Terrible toads are fanatically loyal to the Frog Witch and will fight to the death. A number of them serve as bodyguards for their fearless leader.

Open Skies. These creatures like to take over an area and then hunt for days. There aren't many threats to the whirlybirds, except for a rare dragon or two.

Avian Appetite. The whirlwind effect of these fey can actually change the landscape. It's not hard to find evidence of one of their attacks.

    <description>Bounders race around the Darklands as if they will never run out of energy. These strange horned monsters resemble giant dogs. They usually leave a trail of destruction behind them.

Hound Dogs. Constantly on the move, bounders use their powerful sense of smell to track down prey. They are good hunters and often find creatures that have strayed into the Darklands by accident.

Team Players. Although they are chaotic in nature, these monsters will take orders from creatures they fear. Bounders obey any of the high-ranking members of the Unseelie Court.

    <description>Earthquakes are not unheard of in the Darklands. The reason for this dangerous seismic activity is the movement of canyon crawlers. These strange giant worms burrow underneath the region and cause all sorts of problems. Some ghost towns have had sink holes swallow up entire buildings.

Hidden Realm. Below the surface of Feyland is a bizarre world filled with life. Canyon crawlers like to feast on the creatures that live there. 

Surface World. Although they spend much of their time underground, these monstrosities will also smash through earth and attack victims above ground.

    <description>Centaur mages were also corrupted by the Well of Dreams. Many of them have turned to the dark side and joined the Unseelie Court. A number of the spellcasters are now based in the Darklands.

Huntaur Victory. For years the huntaurs have fought the centaurs and they are pleased that these spellcasters have joined their ranks. The centaur cousins see this as a victory in their ongoing conflict. The huntaurs are training the centaur rebels and enjoy ordering them around.

Forest Campaign. Huntaur warlords (page 122) are currently preparing to send the centaur mages to Everwood. The dark court believe the mages will be useful in the woods and surprise the Seelie forces.

    <description>After toying with the idea of changing sides, Orchid has finally done it. The arch fey left the Seelie Court and joined the rival court when the Well of Dreams was corrupted. She was overcome by dark magic and made the dramatic change.

Ultimate Betrayal. Orchid left her past behind her for what she sees as a more exciting life. The young fey was bored at court in the Great Tree. She had always admired the Unseelie Court and is very pleased with her decision. Her loyal everflower dancers have made the switch as well.

Hard Feelings. The arch fey's former companions were stunned and can't believe she's turned to the dark side. The Seelie Court is determined to punish her for betraying them.

Counted Out. Recently Orchid has been charmed by the creepy Count Batty (page 116). She lives with the vampire in one of the towers in the Fortress of Shade.

    <description>As a brave paladin approaches the Fortress of Shade, he notices something odd. There is a humanoid creature climbing up one of the stone walls like a spider.

Charming Count. This is the callous Count Batty, a vampire who joined the Unseelie Court after arriving from the World of Myrr. In the eyes of some female fey, he is a charming character.

Fresh Flower. Recently the undead monster has ensnared the arch fey Orchid and helped her defect to the dark court. He plans to turn her into a vampire spawn and gather an undead army.

Undead Nature. The count doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>When the Fortress of Shade is airborne, dark wyverns become very important to the Unseelie Court. Many evil fey use the undead creatures to fly back and forth to the headquarters of the diabolical court.

Scary Stinger. Most wyverns have lethal stingers and the dark wyvern's is even more dangerous. Along with quadraksMOF and flying goblinsMOF they make up most the Unseelie Court's air forces.

Wicked Games. The sight of these black wyverns circling the orange skies of the Darklands is unsettling. These creatures aren't bothered by the lightning and dust storms. 

Undead Nature. The dark wyvern doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>A group of brave heroes are searching the Darklands for a lost companion. Then the ground begins to shake, and a massive creature can be seen on the horizon. Without warning, a giant pumpkin heads towards the rescuers.

Monstrous Experiment. The aberration is the result of a terrifying experiment by the Queen of Darkness. She wants to create an army of gigantic monsters.

Root of the Problem. This horror is one of the most powerful brutes of the dark court. It can squash almost anything with its powerful legs and can swallow creatures whole.

Shadowy Land. Giant pumpkins enjoy the dark, grim region and won't venture far from the Darklands. The queen has attempted to get them to attack other parts of Feyland.

    <description>An enormous scarecrow wanders across the Darklands under a full moon. Then it spies a group of centaur intruders. It opens up its grotesque mouth and screams. It's the last thing the centaurs ever hear.

Queen's Construct. The Queen of Darkness personally created these constructs. She has even enchanted the monsters with her terrifying scream.

Dark Guardians. Giant scarecrows are scattered around the spooky region. They serve as guardians for the Unseelie Court, warding off any intruders.

Constructed Nature. A giant scarecrow doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

Rotten Roots. The Harvest Lord usually sends the harvest maidensMOF into other parts of Feyland. His loyal consorts must complete their missions to return to the Castle of Bones.

Wyvern Rider. He usually rides a dark wyvern when he travels long distances.

    <description>Leading the contingents of huntaurs for the Unseelie Court are huntaur warlords. They are the largest, most fierce of the huntaurs in the evil court. These cousins of the centaurs are feared throughout Feyland.

Dark Warrior. Huntaur warlords spend much of their time training huntaur troops in the Darklands. They lead complicated, grueling war games.

Ground Forces. All the huntaurs in the Darklands can only access the Fortress of Shade when it lands on the ground. Unless they're already inside, the stronghold is unreachable when it's airborne.

    <description>An absurd clown is the strangest monster in the Darklands. Long Legs is an unusual fey and the colorful fellow stands out in the barren wasteland.

Dark Humor. This evil clown wanders the Darklands and toys with any creature he encounters. Long Legs loves to play cruel jokes and torture weaker creatures.

Court Jester. The Queen of Darkness enjoys his twisted sense of humor and treats the fey as if he is her court jester. Long Legs is often invited by the queen to entertain in the Fortress of Shade.

Hut Life. His home is a lopsided hut in an isolated canyon. It appears to be a regular-sized building, but it's very spacious inside.

    <description>The Darklands are home to the Unseelie Court and the Fortress of Shade. Pumpkin bats are plentiful in the skies of this desolate land. These unique creatures live in a region of Feyland where autumn never ends.

Surreal Sight. Flying through the air, this creature lights up everything around it. Some fey find the spectacle of dozens of these monsters rather beautiful.

Fiery Fey. The pumpkin bat's breath packs a punch. If a group of the creatures are attacking, the sky can appear to be on fire.

Interior Lighting. Some evil fey capture these creatures and hang them up as a light source. The Unseelie Court's Fortress of Shade is filled with pumpkin bats.

    <description>The Scholar of Autumn is a rather moody, melancholy individual. She is the most unpredictable of the four seasonal scholars from the Academy.

Melancholy Megalomaniac. Eternally sad, this brooding sage has a cloud of negativity hanging over her at all times. There is an actual gloomy, gray cloud hovering above her.

Sad State of Affairs. The scholar is never satisfied. She's always criticizing something and plotting to rise in the ranks of the Unseelie Court.

Mischievous Madame. The Scholar of Autumn would love to take over leadership of the Autumn Court herself. She constantly undermines the power- ful Skeleton King.

    <description>Strangelove is an evil illusionist who usually accompanies the Queen of Darkness. The one-eyed creature even scares the members of the Unseelie Court. He enjoys his solitude in the dungeons of the Fortress of Shade.

Dungeon Denizen. The catacombs beneath the immense fortress appear to go on for miles. Some fey believe the dungeons rival the size of the Frozen Labyrinth that surrounds the Ivory Tower. This is the hidden lair of Strangelove, the place where he conducts experiments.

Time and Space. Strangelove is obsessed with the nature of reality. He experiments daily, sometimes all night as well.

Myrr Fan. This spellcasting fey idolizes the human wizard Oswald Myrr. Strangelove has learned much about the famous mage's work and is particularly interested in using Riftgates to travel the multiverse.

Court Favorite. However, the Queen of Darkness thinks Trick and Treat is funny. She lets the monster torment her minions and laughs off any complaints.

Out of this World. The queen will even send Trick and Treat to the ordinary world. She laughs hysterically for hours when her minions retell the horrifying tales of the fey's journeys.

Homeland Insecurity. Trick and Treat also ventures into other parts of Feyland to scare and intimidate other fey. The Seelie Court has a bounty out on the horrible monster.

    <description>The most dangerous of all the witches and hags in Feyland is the Witch Queen. She is a close advisor of the Queen of Darkness and lives in the Fortress of Shade.

Dark Coven. This witch leads a coven of four that reside in the flying stronghold. Other fey aren't fond of hearing these witches cackling as they ride their broomsticks through the many canyons.

Witch Rival. The Witch Queen is not a fan of the Witch KingMOF She is jealous that the Queen of Darkness has appointed him as her chief henchman.

Two Worlds. Tiring of life in Feyland, the witch often travels to the ordinary world. Once there she gathers potion ingredients that she can't find back in the land of the Fey.

    <description>Hidden in the many libraries in the Ivory Tower are tiny worm-like fey. They live wherever books are found in large quantities. Bookworms are very hard to find and are often overlooked by the inhabitants of the crowded tower.

Hungry for Knowledge. These little creatures consume books and gain the knowledge and arcane power contained within. This is how they gained their ability to cast spells.

Sinister Spellcaster. The bookworm can cast spells three times a day. They love to use these spells to cause chaos in the tower.

Librarian Allies. Many of the librarians in the Academy are aware of the bookworms. Some try to rid the tower of the bothersome fey, but most actually help the tiny monsters.

    <description>While the chancellor is the highest-ranking scholar in the Academy, the Dean of Dreams deals with the day-to-day affairs. He is rather uptight and expects much from the other scholars.

Lost in Thought. The dean is supposed to be running the Academy but is often lost in his own thoughts. His high expectations for others don't line up with those for himself.

Reach for the Top. Ultimately the Dean of Dreams wants the chancellor's position. He doesn't care about the students in the Academy but tries to keep the scholars happy.

Academic Entourage. A couple of the Punk Scholars (page 144) and several of the Faultless (page 135) are usually at the Dean's side as he goes about his day. His chamber is located near the entrance to the Ivory Tower.

    <description>After some areas of the Ivory Tower had been abandoned for many years, the Unseelie Court reopened them. One of the first things to be discovered inside were strange dust monsters.

Unknown Origin. Nobody knows where, or how dust monsters came into being. Although some scholars theorize the creatures must come from the years of toxic dust that has built up in the tower.

Punk Plans. Now that the Punks are taking a leading role in the Unseelie Court, they don't mind these creatures wandering the halls of the Academy. The fact that the monsters might attack students or faculty doesn't seem to bother the new administration.

    <description>Students at the Academy are known as the Faultless. They have come to the Ivory Tower to learn from experienced scholars. However, the Academy has a new agenda that trumps any learning.

Entitled Expectations. The Faultless have grown up being told they can be whatever that want and have whatever they want. They expect to be pampered and protected like very young fey.

Fanatical Feelings. Scholars at the Academy teach the Faultless to be led by their feelings. Their natural instincts are not be trusted. As a result, these students are hypersensitive and extremely immature.

Power Play. The Faultless have been brainwashed to believe that everyone must agree with their beliefs. They are convinced they are always in the right and anyone who doesn't agree is worthless.

    <description>Protecting the Ivory Tower and patrolling the Frozen Labyrinth are frost minotaurs. These heavily armed monstrosities can deal with most intruders quite easily.

Icy Beginnings. Frost minotaurs were brought to Feyland by ice demons. Some fey say they've seen demons wandering the maze at night.

Single-Minded. These monstrosities are warriors who simply smash their opponents. They only know one way to deal with their problems.

Loyal Guard. The horned horrors are loyal to the Unseelie Court and will do whatever they're asked to. They are also used as bodyguards by some of the scholars in the tower.

    <description>A few of the students from the Ivory Tower decide to explore the surrounding wilderness. Suddenly a couple of giant snow creatures emerge from a snowy pass. The frightened students drop their books and race back towards the tower.

Campus Bullies. Giant yetis are mean, thuggish monsters that roam the area surrounding the Frozen Labyrinth. They like to bully any creatures they encounter.

Winter Court. The ugly louts live in spacious ice caves near the Ice Palace and are part of the Winter Court. They aren't fond of their arch fey leaders but obey out of fear.

Matter over Mind. While much of the Unseelie Court in this region is made up of scholars, the yetis provide the muscle. They're jealous of the wealthy, pretentious students who attend the Academy.

    <description>Seated in the highest chamber of the Ivory Tower is the Head Chancellor. He is the leader of the Academy, now heavily under the influence of Thelonius Punk (page 149). The chancellor exploits his position for his own gain and couldn't care less what the scholars and students do.

Big Fey on Campus. This fey is one of the largest creatures in the tower. The hallways and chambers are all constructed so creatures the size of the chancellor can move around easily.

Secret Plots. The Academy has been shaken recently. First Thelonius and his faction seized the Ivory Tower and academic institution within. Now sinister plots seem to lurk around every corner.

Evil Escorts. A quartet of frozen minotaurs guard the chancellor as he travels around the tower. He also has an adult white dragon named Emeritus that he uses to fly around Feyland.

    <description>The Ice Prince is one of the youngest members of the Winter Court. He lives in the elegant Ice Palace with his aunt, also known as the Snow Queen.

Labyrinthian Lurker. This spoiled prince loves to fly through the frozen maze that surrounds the Ivory Tower. He is often accompanied by ice wings (page 140) for his protection.

New Ally. The young fey royal recently found an ally in the Scholar of Winter (page 146). They are hatching a secret plot to overthrow Thelonius Punk and his rebel faction.

Palace Life. A lazy individual, the prince enjoys his luxurious life in the palace. Many nervous servants cater to his every need.

    <description>Patrolling the skies around the Ivory Tower are hideous bird-like creatures called ice wings. They are cruel and crafty.

Cold Customer. Ice wings are just as brutal as the frost minotaurs who also patrol the region. The winged fey enjoy snatching creatures from the labyrinth and dropping them in the nearby Lost Sea.

Rough Rivals. Down on the ground, the minotaurs aren't fond of the ice wings. Fights often break out when the two groups meet. A few frost minotaurs have even been thrown off the tower by ice wings.

Frozen Statues. When the flying fey aren't on patrol, they perch on the Ivory Tower. The designers of the soaring structure built it to match the ice wings' features.

    <description>As a student waits for the text they requested, a strange creature slithers across the stone floor of the main library. It reaches up effortlessly to the highest shelf with one of its long tentacles. The Keeper of the Tomes is the head librarian in the Ivory Tower.

Hidden Agenda. This fey was one of the first creatures corrupted by the Well of Dreams. She had grown tired of the Academy rules and was ready for a change.

Wicked Wordsmith. The keeper is able to twist words and confuse others quite easily. Most fey know better than to strike up a conversation with her.

Silent Sidekick. A library golem (page 142) usually accompanies this venerable librarian. She likes to have one around to do menial tasks, especially shelving books. It also serves as a formidable bodyguard.

    <description>The main library in the Ivory Tower seemed quiet as a Seelie spy entered. Without warning, a bookcase suddenly comes to life. The large magical construct with metal quills for hands advances on the intruder. Books are then launched off the shelves, pelting the fey spy.

On the Shelf. The library golem sits still and blends into the woodwork. The books on their shelves are magical and can't be removed. The titles featured are all horror stories.

Tome Home. However, books can be stored in the empty spaces on the construct's shelves. These books can be removed if the golem doesn't attack.

Hall Monitor. At times the library golems are positioned in the hallways of the tower. Problematic scholars, students or intruders will be dealt with quickly.

Constructed Nature. A library golem doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>The newest scholar at the Academy is Modo Dodo. This oddball has been chosen by Thelonius Punk to work at the Ivory Tower. Most scholars were shocked to learn the news as the bumbling fey isn't qualified at all.

Silly Scholar. Modo Dodo has no qualifications or experience as a scholar. Thelonius knows the ignorant creature will do what he is told. The Academy is now hiring unqualified scholars all the time. The Punks and their leader enjoy the chaos that has overrun the institution.

Timeless Tenure. This dim-witted fey is confident his position in the Academy is secure. Therefore, the scholar has no incentive to do a good job. He is only there to take advantage of the situation for himself.

Idol Worship. Modo Dodo is grateful to Thelonius for gifting him his position. The new scholar is enthusiastically preaching the beliefs of the Punks.

    <description>The Punks are a radical faction of the Unseelie Court. They are led by the infamous Thelonius Punk (page 149). These scholars are responsible for the takeover of the Academy by the Unseelie Court.

Secret Sect. The dark court was unaware of the faction until very recently. These scholars seized control of the Ivory Tower without the approval of the Queen of Darkness.

Punk Palace. All the Punks now live in the tower near the Well of Dreams. They are making plans to use the Ivory Tower as their headquarters to rule all of Feyland.

Revolutionary Ideas. These scholars are fanatically loyal to Thelonius and preach his teachings. The Faultless admire and worship the Punks.

    <description>The bravest individuals in the Academy are rogue scholars. They haven't been corrupted by the Well of Dreams and continue to teach. These fey don't preach an agenda, they are true scholars.

Strange Times. With the takeover by the Unseelie Court, things have taken a turn for the worse for these individuals. They have to be constantly on guard. A few of them have even been thrown off the tower.

Truth Tellers. Rogue scholars do what no other scholars do, they simply teach the truth. They don't bother with the twisted version of reality that most of the Academy teaches.

Extraordinary Measures. To protect themselves, these fey have armed themselves and enlisted some of the athletes. Most of the athletes at the Academy play a wild sport called Skyball. Skyballers (page 147) act as bodyguards for the rogue scholars.

    <description>The most dangerous of all the seasonal scholars is this cool, calculating fey. He has his own plans to take over the Academy and then overthrow the leadership of the Unseelie Court.

Cruel Fool. The Scholar of Winter is also the most heartless of all the scholars. Considering how nasty the others are, this is saying a great deal. Academy Politics. He is part of a plot to seize the

Ivory Tower. In all the chaos after the Well of Dreams was corrupted, the scholar has gathered a group of conspirators. This gang includes the Dean of Dreams and the Ice Prince.

Central Chamber. Located deep in the tower is an enchanted chamber with many protective spells. It is near the Well of Dreams and unknown to most of the inhabitants of the Ivory Tower. This is where the scholar lives, far away from most of the Academy.

    <description>One of the many disciplines at the Academy is athletics. A number of fey at the institution play a sport called Skyball. These flying creatures use scoops to pass iron balls and then shoot them into airborne nets.

Eternally Envious. The skyballers aren't very popular with the other students at the Academy. The Faultless are extremely jealous of the healthy, good-looking athletes.

Scary Scholars. For years the institution respected and celebrated these fey. However, the Ivory Tower has become a hostile environment for the skyballers to learn and train. Since the Academy was taken over by the Unseelie Court it's become a dangerous place for all students except the Faultless.

Spy Game. Spies from the Seelie Court have already begun to make overtures to the skyballers. The good court want them to join their side and move to the Great Tree.

    <description>For years a faction of the Unseelie Court known as the Punks waited in the shadows. However, that has all changed. Thelonius Punk followed Oswald Myrr in secret to the Well of Dreams. The well's power has now been released by this scheming fey.

Avoiding Discomfort. After taking over the Academy, Thelonius has begun to corrupt all of Feyland and spread false beliefs. The first belief is that discomfort must be avoided at all costs.

Trust Your Feelings. Thelonius pays attention to his feelings and is devoted to them. His second belief is that all other creatures must do the same. This immature individual is known to throw intense tantrums if he doesn't get his way.

Righteous War. Thirdly, Thelonius believes creatures are either on the side of truth or not. He wants a war to end the old ways and give power to those who deserve it.
