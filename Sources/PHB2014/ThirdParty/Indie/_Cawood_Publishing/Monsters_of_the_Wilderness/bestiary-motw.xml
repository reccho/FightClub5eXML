    <description>The first monsters that entered the world through Riftgates were the cerebrax. They are from another world ruled entirely by psionic creatures. Oswald's disruption of the fabric of time and space was quickly noticed by these creatures. They brought a strange curse with them and began to search for magic.

Magic Hunters. These aberrations hunt spellcasters and drain their powers. This process fuels the psionic monsters. Having searched the multiverse for magical power they were very pleased to have found Oswald's world.

Mind Control. Cerebrax are insane, foul beings. They want to eventually take over the entire multiverse. The aberrations know they can't compete with powerful spellcasters like Oswald, so lesser magic-users are their usual targets.

Neural Network. Cerebrax can communicate with others of their kind, even through portals like Riftgates. They share a hive mind where they can access each others' memories.

      <name>Master Transmuter</name>
      <text>Oswald can use an action to consume the reserve of transmutation magic stored within his transmuter's stone in a single burst. When he does so, he can choose on of the following effects. His transmuter's stone is destroyed and can't be remade until he finishes a long rest.

Major Transformation. He can transmute one nonmagical object-no larger than a 5-foot cube-into another nonmagical object of similar size and mass and of equal or lesser value. He must spend 10 minutes handling the object to transform it.

Panacea. He removes all curses, diseases, and poisons affecting a creature that he touches with the transmuter's stone. The creature also regains all its hit points.

Restore Life. He casts the raise dead spell on a creature he touches with the transmuter's stone, without expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in his spell book.

Restore Youth. He touches the transmuter's stone to a willing creature, and that creature's apparent age is reduced by 3d10 years, to a minimum of 13 years. This effect doesn't extend the creature's lifespan.</text>

      <name>Minor Alchemy</name>

For each 10 minutes he spends performing the procedure, he can transform up to 1 cubic foot of material.

    <description>Oswald Myrr is a legendary wizard and a new member of the Alliance of the Griffon. Some call him the Wizard of Zogg, after his homeland. Oswald currently lives in a secret woodland manor on the continent of Naern. The people of Zogg and Myrr believe the wizard died 500 years ago. However, he is still alive and on a path of redemption. Long ago he was banished from the Wizard Council for his hazardous experiments. After causing so much turmoil, the ancient mage has joined the Alliance to try to make things right. He usually rides a pegasus as his mount.

If this effect reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag's soul bag. The reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until removed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.</text>

    <description>Oswald's mother is a horrid, insane night hag. She fell in love with Edmund Myrr and was heartbroken when their marriage ended.

Mad Hag. When Mary lost her mind, she began to wander into other worlds. On her journey she headed further and further down a dark path.

Smother Mother. She could never leave her son alone as he grew. Mary became obsessed with the talented Oswald. This behavior drove her gifted son to leave and never return.

Lost Love. At the core of her madness is a broken heart. Her husband didn't just leave her, he didn't love her anymore. While Edmund quickly forgot about his wife, she could never get over him.

    <description>Edmund Myrr is Oswald's father, a broken and disillusioned wizard who turned to the dark side and became a lich.

Dark Path. Fed up with the restrictions of the Wizard Council, Edmund took drastic action. He met with necromancers from the Void and threw himself off Grim Rock. Then the evil spellcasters helped him return to the world as a Lich King. Over a short period of time, Edmund took his place as one of the seven undead Kings of the Void.

    <description>The only creature larger than krakens is the Waugan. This immense titan travels around the entire ocean. At times it can also be found swimming through huge sea caves. It is a solitary creature and has no allies except for an aquarian wizard named Kairos (page 12).

There's Always a Bigger Fish. This massive monster hunts constantly and needs a great deal of nourishment. It feeds on whales, killer whales, dolphins, seals, sea lions, and pretty much anything it wants.

Sizeable Impact. The Waugan is so powerful it can devastate an undersea castle or settlement in minutes. Some people say that it does more damage than an earthquake or tsunami. Entire sahuagin and merfolk colonies have been destroyed by this titan.

Secluded Sea Cave. Legends say that the Waugan inhabits a mammoth sea cave. The creature has looted many of the ships it has sunk and taken the bounty. Therefore, most scholars believe a sizeable treasure hoard must be stowed in its cave.

    <description>Kairos is a member of the Wizard Council who exiled Oswald Myrr. He is also a master of the School of Evocation. This aquarian has big ambitions and is constantly scheming from his lair in a sunken ship. A rival of King Nemos (page 22), he is well-connected in the merfolk community.

Thought Bubble. This highly intelligent aquarian can be his own worst enemy. His mind never seems to rest and he has got lost in his thoughts on more than a few occasions.

Scheming Seaman. Kairos is seeking to overthrow King Nemos with the help of sahuagin and aquarian rebels. He uses a unique conch shell to summon the Waugan.

    <description>Living under the sea are several unique races, and one of the least known are the aquarians. Some folks have heard about a famous gangster known as the Codfather. Most don't realize that he is an aquarian. This race of secretive fish people lives far from most other humanoid communities.

Fish Folk. The aquarians are ruled by a nasty queen named Atlantia (page 14). A few of these creatures live on land, the infamous Codfather being the most well-known of them.

Undersea City. At the center of the aquarian society is Nautilus, their capital city. It is composed of extensive sea caves and labyrinthian tunnels. Other sea creatures, including many schools of fish, seals, sharks, and octopi share the settlement.

Uneasy Alliance. The sahuagin used to be enemies of the aquarians but a recent treaty has changed all that. However, having an alliance with the devious sea devils is never easy. A missing aquarian scouting party has raised fears that the sahuagin cannot be trusted.

    <description>The cold, heartless leader of the aquarians is Atlantia. She rules with an iron fist and crushes any opposition by force. Her four tentacles are always busy grabbing objects and touching her surroundings. Coral statues of her likeness are found throughout Nautilus, the aquarians' biggest settlement.

Fish Queen. The queen lives in a massive sea cave at the center of Nautilus. As she is one of the largest aquarians, her home is very spacious. She loves shiny, precious objects and hides them away in a large treasure vault.

Two Schools of Thought. A number of aquarians have left the sea to live on land amongst humans and other humanoids. However, the queen and most of the aquarian leadership are set against this. They want aquarians to live in the sea and remain part of their community.

Elite Entourage. A group of elite aquarian soldiers protects the queen. She also has a trio of coroctopi (page 15) near her at all times. She has the support of most of her people, although this is based on fear.

    <description>A school of brightly colored fish swims past a coral reef. Unexpectedly, part of the reef moves. Hiding there is a strange creature known as the coroctopus. It is an octopus that has formed out of coral. Strange energies came through a Riftgate and created this unusual monster.

Rock Solid. The main reason this creature is so difficult to deal with is its hard body. The coroctopus' coral exterior provides ample protection against most attacks from predators.

Coral Camouflage. The ability to hide underwater makes the coroctopus a deadly enemy. It is not uncommon for one of these monsters to seem to vanish underwater. They are quite skilled at camouflaging themselves.

Fishermen's Friend. Local fishermen can actually benefit from the presence of this monster. It doesn't usually attack them and the coroctopus scares fish, crabs, and other creatures into the open.

    <description>These odd creatures can be seen from very far away. Coral eels are made from luminescent coral and radiate a bright white light. They seldom surprise their prey but they have a unique way of attacking.

Deep Blue Sea. Coral eels enjoy colder waters but can be found in any ocean region. These creatures are constantly hunting for food sources. They also breathe out large magical bubbles to trap prey. This unusual attack takes many creatures by surprise.

Bubble Trouble. These monstrosities are sometimes called bubble eels. Humanoids who live near their territory know to stay out of the water when they're around.

Gregarious Gangs. Coral eels often travel in groups of about ten. Although they can be found in the hundreds near the coast. They mainly eat cod, halibut, shrimp, salmon, and octopi. However, their magical bubbles enable them to hunt larger prey such as seals.

Eye-Opening. The Deep One crossed through an underwater Riftgate into the ordinary world. It has powerful magic and can affect other creatures miles away. This strange aberration schemes to take control by enthralling those in power.

Deep Magic. Even though it swims far from royal palaces and other seats of power, the Deep One uses magic to enter the minds of unsuspecting creatures. It will use its scrying and dream spells, as well as telepathy to influence others. At times, the monster will have its victims make an undersea journey to meet face-to-face.

Sand Crawlers. Although they are usually in the sea, demon crabs also venture onto beaches and other areas around the coast. There have been recent tales of raids on small fishing villages by these horrid creatures.

Evil Eye. The fiend's large eye can shoot out a bizarre green ray. This magical beam can cause a creature to be mutilated in strange ways. The unfortunate victims are often ostracized when they return to their communities.

    <description>The Fathomer is a sorcerer who was transformed into a fish man. A ray of mutilation from a demon crab changed his life. His entire body was permanently altered during the attack.

Hateful Homeland. The sorcerer's friends and family were horrified and they turned against him. Labeled a mutant, he was banished from his hometown. The broken, miserable creature fled to the sea.

New Beginning. The Fathomer's life span has been extended by the transformation and he could live for several hundred years. He now lives in a sunken ruin on a mysterious island.

Sea of Love. Recently the Fathomer has fallen in love with a mermaid. Although she is drawn to the tormented creature, she is scared of his unpredictable nature.

    <description>Swimming under the surface of the sea are enormous undead whales. Encountering one of the horrors can be one of the most terrifying moments for an adventurer.

Second Life. These whales have returned from the land of the dead with a vengeance. Ghost whales will target whalers and fisherfolk first. However, they will attack almost any ship and attempt to sink it.

Below the Surface. Ghost whales are one of the biggest creatures in the sea, usually about 100 feet long. Intelligent mammals like whales and dolphins can sense something is wrong with these grim creatures and avoid them.

Undead Nature. The ghost whale doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>A large fin pierces the blue of the sea. Lurking just out of sight is a powerful predator. However, this is no ordinary sea creature. This is the giant shark zombie, a lethal killing machine. Shark zombies resemble living sharks, but they also show the wounds that killed them.

Great Guardian. These undead horrors are used by sahuagin to guard important locations. The sharks are able to follow simple commands from the sea devils.

Powerful Predator. They are at least 30 feet long and have sizeable jaws. Giant shark zombies always take the shortest route to their prey. Groups of shark zombies often work together to swarm victims.

Sahuagin Servant. Some sahuagin also use these undead as mounts. Many mariners believe sahuagin necromancers are responsible for bringing the fearsome sharks back from the dead.

Undead Nature. A giant shark zombie doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>Far beneath the waves is a different world. A stunning, white city carved out of coral sits on the sea floor. At the center of this remote settlement is a magnificent castle. Sitting on its throne is the ruler of the merfolk, King Nemos.

Regal Royal. The king is a brave, honest merman and loved by his people. He is also a fierce, gruff warrior and few ever challenge his power. King Nemos doesn't deal with change well and wants the merfolk community to follow the ancient traditions.

Family Fishman. Sorrow grows in his heart as his wife was killed in a sahuagin raid. He now focuses on raising his seven daughters. All seven are precocious mermaid princesses who want their independence.

Undersea Palace. His large family, including the many princesses, all live in Coral Castle. A company of merfolk knights are based at the castle with a stable of dolphins and sea horses.

Precocious Princess. Mermaids are usually quite self-absorbed and egocentric. However, they are also usually very curious and are especially interested in those creatures that live on land.

Under the Sea. These beautiful merfolk usually live inside underwater castles or caves deep beneath the waves. They make jewelry and tools out of shells and bones.

Loyal Companions. Mermaids often have sea creatures as close companions. Dolphins, seals, crabs, and other beasts often befriend them.

    <description>One of the largest monsters in the sea is the legendary sea serpent. It makes any journey across the ocean a perilous voyage.

Powerful Swimmers. Sea serpents are strong swimmers and are surprisingly agile in the water. They seem to be more active in wild, intense storms. Their superior swimming ability lets them easily navigate these wild waves.

Ocean Hazard. Those adventurers brave enough to travel across wide stretches of ocean might have to face this nightmare. Some maps mark the locations where a sea serpent has been sighted.

Salty Mouth. A sea serpent's breath is so awful it will harm any nearby creatures. The odor is rumored to smell like a salty dead whale.

    <description>Sailors swear that some seals can turn into humans. This is close to the truth, selkies are actually fey creatures that can shapechange into seals.

Rocky Romance. Selkies have been known to fall in love with humans who find their seal skin. If someone possesses their skin, the selkie's magic doesn't work on them. The fey aren't the best judge of character and find it hard to escape unhealthy relationships. Children born from marriages with selkies have webbed toes and fingers.

Seven Year Hitch. Every seven years there is a chance a selkie can't return to its humanoid form and remains in seal form. These shapechangers are usually shunned by other fey creatures and forgotten about.

    <description>A ghost ship pulls alongside a galley under a full moon. Out of nowhere, an armed skeleton appears. It leaps onto the vessel with its weapon raised. More of the undead crew climb up from below deck with wooden planks to board the galley.

Brutal Buccaneer. Undead pirates are even worse than living pirates. Raiding ships and taking the bounty is all they know. They seem to continue to live their lives as if they'd never died.

Dark Tides. These monsters are pirates who were betrayed by their own evil crews. Angry and vengeful, they continue to plunder.

Ghost Ships. Most undead pirates sail on board ghost ships. Some guard treasure on remote islands. Others haunt ancient shipwrecks or abandoned docks.

Undead Nature. An undead pirate doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>Skeletal pirates kidnap the crew of a flagship. After the prisoners are taken to the deck of a pirate ship, a tall figure pushes past the strange crew. It is the notorious undead pirate captain.

Curious Captain. This clever, devious monster is a terrifying opponent. The hidden tentacles in his back only reveal themselves when he attacks.

Legendary Leader. His rowdy band of pirates are very loyal. The captain assembled the motley crew, and they will do anything for him. Every band of undead pirates has their own captain.

Undead Nature. An undead pirate doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

Feyland Foreigner. Wave riders crossed over from Feyland through underwater Riftgates. They have found the ordinary world is unprepared for creatures such as themselves and are beginning to take advantage.

Peculiar Pirate. These fey engage in piracy and also make life difficult for ordinary pirates. A group of wave riders can easily overwhelm a ship's crew. Sailors and pirates alike are trying to find a way to deal with this new threat.

    <description>There are a number of strange monsters in the ocean. The wicked tuna is one of the most bizarre. It hunts in groups and can be a menace to any seaside community.

Sizeable Sea Creature. Many fisherfolk and sailors are surprised at the size of the wicked tuna. This creature is almost the size of a small whale. Coastal communities have begun to fear them as much as sharks.

Wild Waves. Wicked tuna cause mayhem with fishing fleets. They sink boats, rip nets apart, and eat fisherfolk. Most people know to pull in their nets and head back to land if a wicked tuna arrives on the scene.

    <description>Wandering across the snowy landscape is a massive, menacing creature. It is so large it seems as if the land itself has come to life. The Ragnar is an unstoppable force that dominates a large territory. Most other creatures flee at the sight of this gigantic terror.

Ready to Rumble. The ground literally shakes when the Ragnar is in the vicinity. It can cause avalanches and leaves a trail of destruction in its wake. Even its huge footprints make a sizeable impact on the environment.

Brutal Behemoth. This creature is a pure predator and stands at the very top of the food chain. Even the mighty snow elves, also known as the vothdar, have trouble handling this titan. They will often escape to their airships if the Ragnar is in the area.

Roaming Around. This titan usually feeds on ozlogs. It's an incredible sight to see the enormous Ragnar chasing a herd of the beasts across an expansive glacier. Only Varga the Ice Witch knows that that this monster was created when dark magic came through a portal. These strange magical gates are known as Riftgates. The witch has a close bond with the fearsome creature.

    <description>Drumming echoes from deep inside an ice cave. Wrapped in furs, an old woman communes with dark spirits through her instrument. Varga the Ice Witch knows what part of the cave is solid enough to stand the waves of sound. A large white wolf is curled up nearby on a pile of furs.

Cold Crone. Those creatures that live in this frozen wasteland should pray they never cross Varga's path. Her twisted heart is as cold as the land itself. She is forever bound to the Ragnar, a massive titan that lives in the Arctic. The dark magic that brought the creature to life helps her to commune with it.

Magical Protection. Varga is a master of abjuration magic and the cold climate doesn't affect her. She is able to ward off many dangers, natural and unnatural. A recluse, Varga rarely ever sees other humans and feels at home in the wilderness.

Wolf Mount. She usually travels around the frozen land on her wolf named Ulfar. The wolf's pack and other beasts help protect Varga's cave.

    <description>Clinging to an icy wall is a bizarre creature. The disturbing crystal spider lives in areas that most other monsters cannot reach. It can even scale sheer ice cliffs with its strong legs. Swarms of young crystal spiders have also been seen with these monstrosities.

Snow Spider. Crystal spiders can hide in the snowy terrain and surprise their victims. It's quite the sight to see this massive spider make its presence known.

Patient Predator. Ambushing other creatures is what the crystal spider does best. They are very patient and will wait hours and hours for prey to wander by. Then the crystal spider spits a cold paralyzing liquid. Once the target is immobilized, the monster will drag the victim off to its lair.

Icy Inhabitants. The spider's crystal caves are usually hidden far away from other creatures. These lairs are littered with crystals, gemstones, bones, and furs. Finding these lairs is an adventure in itself.

    <description>A party of adventurers cautiously makes its way across a snowy crevasse. Without warning, a bluish-white dragon drops from the sky and breathes a blast of freezing cold air. Half of the heroes are literally frozen in their tracks.

Cool Intellect. Unlike its white dragon cousin, the ice dragon is rather intelligent. In fact, it is a wily and clever creature. These dragons know when they're outmatched and won't hesitate to fight again another day. An ice dragon will usually make its home in a large ice cavern. It makes sure to choose a strategic location it can defend.

Frozen in Their Tracks. Their powerful breath can freeze victims and make them easy targets. The ice dragon will use its breath weapon at a great distance and then move in to attack with its jaws and claws. However, the sight of the dragon is so terrifying that most creatures don't get close enough to feel its icy breath.

Snow Problem. Snow elf forces often hunt these dragons. The two foes don't feel they can share the Arctic peacefully. Ferocious air battles between the snow elves' airships and ice dragons are legendary. The elves are always working on new ways to protect their craft from these creatures.

    <description>A convoy of armored polar bears comes to a halt. The lead rider has signalled a warning to the group. This is Harald the Norvan King, the ruler of his northern tribe. He is a beast of a man, towering over most of his people.

Barbarian King. The king is a confident, free-thinker and doesn't get caught up in his emotions. Harald is armed with a magical hammer and is always protected by a large contingent of Norvan soldiers.

Inner Conflict. His ruling Snow Eagles clan are named for the giant eagles who live in the Arctic. The opposing clan are led by a younger group of men and are known as the Iron Bears. Both clans live in Norvald and have recently settled on the continent of Myrr. Their rivalry has come close to open warfare in the new land.

Formidable Fortress. Harald makes his home in a massive castle near the sea. He has a force of over 2000 soldiers, spellcasters, many ships, and hundreds of armored polar bears.

    <description>When a young member of the Norvan tribe begins to have visions, the community knows another shaman has been chosen. These individuals are called by nature to heal the world. They are profoundly present and can only speak the truth. There are only a handful of shamans in the frozen lands.

Wise Elder. These wise men and women don't ally themselves with any clan. They remain outside of everyday life and avoid politics in the settlements. Most of these seers don't marry and they enjoy their solitude.

Wilderness Homes. Shamans live away from the Norvan settlements in huts or caves, far from other people. They are close to the beasts in the area and can call on their help if they need it. Many of the healers have strong relationships with the giant eagles who live in the North.

Natural Cycle. They are extraordinary people, deeply in tune with nature and the inner lives of humans. Some shamans spend more time in their animal form than their human shape. Other elders say that shamans even know of future events that haven't manifested yet.

    <description>Living in the far north are a tribe of humans called the Norvans. They are people who value their personal freedom very highly. At the same time, they work together to survive in the harsh region. Their culture is rich in history and the Norvans have begun to expand their influence.

Tough Northerners. Their snowy and mountainous home continent of Norvald is not an easy place to live. Norvans are usually clothed in thick furs and regularly use armored polar bears to move around the challenging terrain.

Two Factions. Over time the Norvans have split into two clans: the older more patient Snow Eagles and the young impulsive Iron Bears. The Snow Eagles have held power for many years, but some of the younger faction have seized power on the continent of Myrr.

Southern Settlements. The tribe lives in several settlements on the continents of Norvald, Zogg, and Myrr. Most Norvans live in a few well-protected, large cities near the sea. Sailing the turbulent, dangerous oceans is a central part of their culture.

    <description>A sole fisherman has ventured out onto the sea ice. As he unpacks his gear, he feels the heavy ice move underneath him. Without warning, a massive creature smashes through the thick ice and rears up above the stunned man. This is the ice breaker, a terrifying monster that lives in the frozen waters of the Arctic.

On Thin Ice. Ice breakers love to lurk under the ice, hunting for prey. They can see in the dark waters and sense their prey by listening or feeling the ice move. These fierce killers frequently live near the coast where animals are more likely to wander onto the ice.

Hard-Headed. Their large heads are solid and can easily smash through solid ice. Many of their prey are surprised as the monster can attack without warn- ing. An ice breaker isn't very bright, but it is aware of its surroundings.

Local Fare. These monstrosities feed on any- thing they can find. They prefer to hunt seals, polar bears, nordaks, ozlogs, and other beasts. However, they will also dive deep down and feed on plants on the sea floor.

    <description>Enormous shadows can be seen moving through a foggy pass. Then several huge, dark mammoths begin to emerge from the mist. These undead mammoths are the result of dark magic that came through Riftgates. Necrotic energy that entered this region twists the souls of some mammoths when they die.

Hulking Horror. The vothdar will use these undead creatures as pack animals. Their necromancers, the blizzard wizards, can command the sizable creatures to do their bidding. However, the undead horrors can only take simple directions from the snow elves.

Herd Immunity. Undead mammoths usually stick together in groups. The region is a very dangerous place, and they will try to remain in their herd. Since they can see in the dark and don't have the requirements of living creatures, some herds can be seen on the move in the middle of the night.

Undead Nature. An undead mammoth doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>Traveling across the snowy wasteland is much easier while riding a nordak. These hardy beasts are sought after by many humanoids in the coldest climates. The beasts are well suited to the terrain and its extremely cold temperatures.

Sole Survivors. These creatures are at home in this stark landscape. Nordaks feed off small animals and native plants. They can be found in small groups or on their own. Unlike many beasts, they don't need the company of others of their species.

Chilled Out. Nordaks are very relaxed creatures and nothing seems to bother them. There are stories of avalanches crashing down around them as they calmly travel through the area. These northern creatures will even assist their riders in combat, as they are wise enough to work together.

Inner Warmth. When a nordak is cut open it can be used to keep a humanoid warm. During this process, a number of interesting items have been found in the stomachs of these beasts. The vothdar also make a warming potion from the creature's blood.

    <description>A herd of odd horned beasts thunder across a thick icy plain. The ground quakes as the mass of northern cattle are on the move. Ozlogs populate much of the Arctic region. Their life is usually brutal and short.

Ice Cattle. They are hunted by numerous predators and provide sustenance to others in this harsh land. These beasts provide a lot of meat for the snow elves who hunt them on nordaks and their smaller airships.

Inhospitable Herd. Ozlogs are bad-tempered beasts and will attack any intruders in their territory. The strongest ozlog is the leader and fights determine the hierarchy for the species. Two of the larger of the species will usually lock horns and attempt to subdue each other.

Home on the Range. Ozlogs live off plants in the tundra and must keep moving to find food. Their thick skin and hardy coats provide them good protection from the elements.

    <description>One of the great mysteries of the mortal realm is the Northern Lights. The source of this phenomenon are the people of the sky. These huge fey beings cross over from Feyland to lure creatures into other worlds.

Mesmerizing Lights. The evil fey can take the form of brightly colored lights and dance through the sky. Their mysterious and breath-taking forms are almost too beautiful to describe. In their true forms, these fey appear as giant-like creatures.

On the Threshold. People of the sky search for Riftgates and open them in order to bring creatures into Feyland and other domains. After Oswald Myrr created the Riftgates by accident, these highly intelligent fey quickly found a use for them.

The Far Away. Nobody has found their true home, believed to be deep inside Feyland. There is no doubt the cruel creatures are members of the Unseelie Court. Rumors persist that this malevolent court are using the people of the sky to further their agenda.

    <description>Some polar bears are more intelligent and wiser than others. These large beasts are chosen as mounts by the Norvans. Once chosen they are fitted with thick half-plate armor. The armored polar bear is a fierce opponent and the epitome of bravery. With metal fitted on their impressive claws the bears become even more lethal.

Loyal Mount. Once a rider and bear form a bond it can't be broken. Clever and sage, the armored polar bears are more companions than domesticated animals. In fact, the Norvans honor and respect these creatures in many ways.

Heavy Burden. Armored polar bears can carry huge loads. The Norvans load up the bears with gear for battle or transport goods from one settlement to another. Convoys of the bears can often be seen traveling across the snowy land.

Big Bad Bear King. An armored polar bear named Karhu Nan considers himself to be the ruler of his species. This evil creature plots to take control of the bears and rebel against their Norvan masters.

    <description>Where the shapeshifter came from, nobody really knows. Its true form is something very alien. The shapeshifter's goal is to eliminate all other life forms. If left unchecked, it could take over the entire world.

Odd Infiltrator. This aberration uses every trick to find a way into communities of other creatures. It will take the forms of other creatures that are most useful and begin its campaign. As it moves through the world it leaves a trail of corpses, usually hidden from view.

Serious Survivor. Identifying this monster is the initial challenge, the next is trying to eradicate it. The shapeshifter can survive almost anything. However, it does have a fear of fire and will avoid it if possible. This is the main reason is has traveled to the Arctic region.

Like the Plague. A shapeshifter has caused all kinds of havoc in the vothdar community. Many, many snow elves died before they got the shapeshifter out of their settlements. However, it survived and continues to spread its influence.

    <description>Living deep inside dark, snowy caverns are cousins of the ogre. These snogres have adapted to the Arctic and are more powerful than normal ogres. They have thick hide and arm themselves with deadly ice weapons.

Angry Aggressor. Snogres are incredibly aggressive and territorial. They will attack any creatures that get near their cave. Blessed with a good sense of smell, they are generally able to find intruders in their territory.

Slow Kill. They often string up their victims and toy with them for hours. After torturing their victims over an extended period, the snogre will kill and eat them. These giants are particularly fond of eating humanoids. Survivors who escape a snogre's cavern tell horrific tales.

Wild Kingdom. When these creatures can't find ozlogs or nordaks to eat, they explore the many caves in the Arctic. They will attempt to survive on snow hares and other smaller animals if they have to. Most snogres live and hunt alone.

    <description>Living on a far northerly continent is a race of evil snow elves. The vothdar are actually descended from high elves who began to worship devils. This was another consequence of Riftgates opening up. Thanks to the actions of Oswald Myrr, devils made their way to the continent of Naern. Eventually they corrupted a group of the high elves.

Infernal Allies. These elves were banished from the continent of Naern for devil-worshipping. They are cold-hearted creatures that have created a patriarchal society on the northern land of Voth. King Vuthar rules with an iron fist and his loyal blizzard wizards relay his orders to the rest of the snow elves. Ancient noble houses from their time in Naern still dominate the society. The powerful vothdar rule almost all of the snowy land. They have developed new technologies, including magically powered airships.

Snow Elves. These elves are well-adapted to living in the cold. When not traveling in airships, they usually use nordaks as mounts. Oswald Myrr named their frozen continent after their race.

New World Order. The vothdar have plans to conquer the entire world. Their scouts have already ventured onto the continents of Naern and Norvald. They plan to invade by using their massive airships to ferry soldiers over to neighboring lands. They despise other elves and will attack them on sight.

    <description>Blizzard wizards are the necromancers of the vothdar. These spellcasters are high-ranking members of the evil snow elf race. They are closely allied with the king and pilot all the vothdar's airships.

Elf Necromancers. These wizards craft the magical vithral armor that most of the vothdar wear. It is made from adamantine, a material found in large quantities in the Arctic. The armor is then altered by magic to make it lighter. They also make potions for sick elves from the blood of the nordak.

Sky Pilots. The vothdar's airships are powered by the magic wielded by these wizards. Blizzard wizards will cast wind spells to control the sails.

Rival Casters. There is an ongoing rivalry between the blizzard wizards and the vothlocks. The necromancers are part of the king's inner circle and have a higher rank than the warlocks. A few female vothdar are vothlocks, but only male vothdar can become wizards.

    <description>As a shimmering red pentagram glows, a red-skinned monster appears out of the thin air. A white-haired snow elf laughs manically nearby and claps their hands. This is the vothlock, a snow elf warlock.

Power Play. These warlocks covet any position where they can influence the king. Each of them serves a devil patron and the fiends want the vothdar to take over the world. Of course, the devils want the world for themselves and plan to eventually betray the snow elves.

Knowledge Seeker. The vothlocks are always attempting to learn more about the Arctic, the world, and the multiverse. They will pass along this information to their infernal patrons. At times they might also give this knowledge to the vothdar hierarchy. 

Gory Details. The vothlock take charge of any interrogations and run the vothdar prisons. They love nothing more than toying with prisoners, especially other races. The king won't think twice about having the vothlocks do his dirty work.

    <description>As an enormous airship flies through a blizzard, a cloaked vothdar barks out orders to his troops. This is Vuthar, the powerful king of the vothdar. An extremely tall and handsome snow elf, he stands out in a crowd. In his grasp is a legendary weapon known as the Greatsword of Hell. Legends say the weapon was gifted to him by a very influential arch-devil.

Evil Emperor. Vuthar is a nasty, wrathful male elf. He is only interested in power and his ego has no bounds. This king believes the vothdar are the master race and should rule the entire world. He isn't aware that the devils are simply using his people to further their agenda.

Pyramid Scheme. The king sits at the apex of vothdar society, with his blizzard wizards next in the hierarchy. Next are the military commanders and elite vothdar soldiers. A dozen vothdar consorts usually accompany the monarch, also serving as bodyguards.

Imminent Invasion. Vuthar plans to invade the neighbouring lands of Naern and Norvald soon. The vothdar believe they need to take the two smaller continents before starting any war with Myrr or Zogg. Soldiers are training for the war and the tools of war are being built at a rapid pace.

    <description>Perched high atop distant snowy peaks are the Yarr beaks. These evil birds hunt from their lofty homes, swooping down to attack their victims. Powerful wings enable the large creatures to fly in the difficult conditions of the Arctic. They are also tough to spot as they can easily hide in the frozen terrain.

Rapacious Raptor. The Yarr beak is always hungry and on the hunt. It sleeps more than half the day and needs to feed a lot during its waking hours. However, their eyes are bigger than their stomachs, so they'll attack almost anything.

Air Superiority. Their position high above the land gives them an advantage over most other creatures. Yarr beaks can see their prey from great distances and hunt in a wide area.

Adaptable Avian. The large birds will also hunt for fish in the lakes, rivers, and coastal areas. Yarr beaks boldly dive into the water after spotting fish, seals, and other creatures from high above.

    <description>Silence fills the air near a busy oasis. Animals listen more intently as they know a predator has moved into the area. Then without warning, an immense creature smashes out of the ground. The giant sand shark has surfaced to hunt anything and everything.

Sum of All Fears. Many that live in the desert tell tales of a monster too big to believe. However, the stories are true. The giant sand shark travels under the sand hunting for its next meal.

On the Move. It is almost always on the move. However, this titan does rest for periods, slumbering deep below the dunes. Some say its lair is a gigantic, subterranean cavern. An eccentric gnome wizard named Quora Yav (page 58) is said to visit the monstrosity.

Desert Diet. This carnivorous titan will feed on beasts, humanoids, and even other monsters. It has no interest in feeding on plants, so it's well-suited to the desert.

    <description>The least respected of the wizard council is Quora Yav. He is a master in the School of Illusion. This coward travelled to the desert through a Riftgate upon drawing the shortest straw on the council. He is furious he had to go to the barren wasteland. Quora lives in an ancient ruin near a small human settlement. He casts illusions around his lair to keep it hidden from view.

Unpopular Illusionist. This gnome is a spineless, selfish wizard who acts before he thinks. If Quora is ever in danger in the desert, he'll use his illusion magic to turn invisible and head for the closest Riftgate. Once there, he'll travel to his home city in Zogg and take refuge in his well-protected manor.

    <description>Roaming the desert sands are enormous creatures known as appaloruses. These colossal monstrosities are a sight to behold. Most of them make their homes near lush oases.

Scary Sight. Other creatures will flee the area when this odd monster arrives on the scene. It's a slow-moving creature but can be dangerous in close combat.

Dust Storms. Many of the humanoids in the desert blame these monsters for the severe dust storms. However, the appaloruses only breathe dust clouds and not enormous storms.

Plant Eater. The appalorus lives on a diet of cacti and other desert plants. The Jinnan (page 68) will hunt these creatures for food if they're desperate.

    <description>A buzzing sound fills the air above lonely desert dunes. The crescent moon illuminates a glistening procession of flying creatures. A raiding party of arthrops is heading towards a nearby oasis. The bizarre insect-like humanoids break formation as their leader touches a crystal in his throat. Moments later, shouts break out in nearby tents as the raid begins.

Hive Hierarchy. Arthrops have lived in the desert for thousands of years. They have a strict hierarchy and the queen is their supreme leader. The hive lives in an extensive system of hidden tunnels underground. Their queen is heavily protected by an elite group of guards.

Desert Warriors. These unusual creatures fashion their weapons out of items from the natural world. Remains of giant insects, plants, and anything stolen on raids are used by the resourceful humanoids. They know every inch of the desert world and use the terrain to their advantage.

New Voices. When the Riftgates opened, Oswald's curse took away their ability to speak. Arthrops used to speak in clicks and other natural sounds. Chaos tore apart their close society until healing crystals were found. Magical energy from the gems gave the arthrops a new voice and immunity against being charmed.

    <description>Bakkar is an experienced desert ranger. He is skilled in navigating the hazardous, unforgiving terrain. The elders say he has guided many adventurers across the harsh desert. His services cost many gold coins, but they're worth it.

Iron Will. They don't come tougher than the nomadic Bakkar. He once led a group of explorers across a desert with a separated shoulder, broken rib, and punctured lung. However, this man's mental strength surpasses his remarkable physical stamina.

Dune Rider. Bakkar usually rides a sand strider (page 69) he has named Skrattle.

    <description>A group of hunters travel across the desert through an area full of cacti. One of them notices that several of the plants have moved overnight. She dismounts her sand strider (page 69) and finds odd tracks on the ground. The cactus cursus is a killer plant that resembles a normal cactus.

Killer Cactus. These bizarre plants hunt for food across the desert. They are able to move and often hide amongst normal cacti. It's more likely these cacti will be found near oases and other areas with a water source.

Poisonous Plants. A nasty poison is inside the plant's needles. When needles are shot into a creature, the deadly poison enters their victim's bloodstream. One remedy for the poison is to make a potion from a real cactus.

Weakest Link. These plants will target small groups of creatures or pick off stragglers in a larger convoy. Sometimes the cause of death remains undetermined for a long time.

    <description>Slithering silently through the scorching sand is a horrible monster. The desert naga is a cunning, cruel monstrosity who persecutes other creatures. It uses necromancy and other dark magic to further its cause.

Blood Diamonds. This greedy snake-like creature is obsessed with gold, gemstones, and other glittery treasures. It will make deals to take possession of these priceless items, although it will rarely honor such an arrangement.

Close Stalker. Eager for treasure and corpses, the desert naga is usually found near a humanoid settlement. Ruins, hidden caves, and other desolate locations serve as convenient lairs.

Immortal Nature. A naga doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>A group of explorers climbs yet another sand dune. Once at the top, the party looks out at all the dunes stretching out to the horizon. Then a giant beetle crests the closest one, it flips onto its back and slides down.

Sand Species. These beasts are usually found in great numbers in the desert. Most of them live in burrows dug in the sand but some inhabit ruined temples and other old buildings.

Slip Sliding Around. Dune bugs can easily flip onto their backs and get back to their feet. To navigate dunes, the strange creatures flip onto their backs and slide down.

Insect Mount. Some Jinnan (page 68) use dune bugs as mounts. Every new moon there is a race down the highest dune with these beasts. The winner is showered with gold and other treasures.

    <description>A celebrated hero confidently flies over the desert on his hippogriff. The young man is enjoying the spectacular view when suddenly a massive red worm launches itself into the air. In a split second the dunewinder swallows the rider and his mount.

Sky Watcher. These huge worms usually tunnel under the sand. However, they also look up from their holes to see what prey is flying by. They have the surprising ability to stretch vertically into the sky and attack airborne creatures.

Underground Transit. The dunewinder's tunnels are quite large. Other monsters use these passages to travel under the desert sand. If they run into the monstrosity, they better hope it isn't hungry.

Crude Construction. Some of the worm's tunnels aren't very stable though. There is always a chance that one of these passages can collapse.

    <description>A voyage across the desert is filled with many obstacles. The trapdoor spider is one that most explorers will never see until it's too late.

Hidden Hideout. These monsters dig holes in the desert sand and lie in wait for any prey. It is very difficult to find the spiders once they have hidden.

Paralysis Problems. The poison injected into their victims can paralyze their prey. Once the target is immobilized the spider will attempt to eat it. Their nests are usually filled with the remains of these victims.

Noxious Nest. Giant trapdoor spiders make their nests in large underground lairs. These are not the same burrows as the holes they dig for hunting.

    <description>Hidden under the hot desert sand is a massive monster. Jaws of the Desert is feared by almost every creature under the sun. It tunnels into the sand and digs a sizeable hole. Then it sits with its massive mouth wide open, tongue ready and tendrils ready to strike. Some evil humanoids will take prisoners and throw them into the hole to appease the creature.

Big Appetite. Their jaws are enormous, and they can eat almost anything. Jaws of the Desert senses movement through the earth and is always ready to strike with its tendrils.

Deep Burrow. It lives in an extensive burrow. Underneath the monster are numerous tunnels, including one with a sizeable treasure hoard.

Underground Allies. An underground ecosystem is supported by this apex predator. Other small creatures live in the tunnels and feed off the remains of its victims.

    <description>The Jinnan live on the southern desert continent of Jinos in the World of Myrr. Like most other continents in Myrr, the danger of sea monsters has kept them from traveling to other parts of the world.

Strict Hierarchy. They have a highly organized society with the Sun King at the top. This person comes to power by taming the sun horse (page 71). He rules his people and commands a powerful force of warriors. Faithful worship of the sun is at the center of their culture.

Horrible Hive. Throughout their history, the Jinnan have fought against the evil arthrops. Most Jinnan attack the insectoids as soon as they lay their eyes on them. Both sides want control of the desert and aren't interested in negotiating.

Desert Mounts. Jinnan usually use sand striders (page 69) to travel around. However, the beasts are temperamental, and conflicts can occur with their riders.

    <description>This large Insect-like creature runs on the desert sand. They move quickly and are well-adapted to the harsh, dry climate. Even though there are many predators in this barren land, the speed and agility of these beasts helps them to survive.

Quick Stepper. Sand striders are sought after as mounts by the Jinnan, a group of humans that live in the desert. Explorers also use them to get around the unforgiving environment.

Independent Insect. Sand striders don't bond with their riders very well. Several of these monsters have killed humanoids that got on their bad side.

Deep Resources. This creature stores a surprising amount of water in its unusual frame. This enables sand striders to survive the extremely dry conditions.

    <description>Roaming the desert is a frightening monster known as Scorpla. It is an undead horror created by a Jinnan necromancer. The creature was originally kept in a compound, but it escaped.

Sinister Scorpion. Scorpla roams the desert and not much can stand in its way. Jinnan scouting parties have tangled with it and none have returned.

Desert Mirage. The most common way Scorpla attacks is by hiding in the hot sand. Then it ambushes any victims that wander by. It is a stunning sight when the massive creature emerges from the sand.

Dark Deeds. Most Jinnan aren't evil, but necromancers do exist on the fringes of their society. The grim spellcasters harness energies that passed through Riftgates to create disturbing mutants.

Undead Nature. Scorpla doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>Silence hangs over the scorched desert. Then without warning, a flash of light streaks across the hot sand. A fiery steed known as the sun horse races to its destination. Somehow able to survive the flames, a human is riding the wild mount.

Quest for Fire. The leader of the Jinnan people, the Sun King, is chosen when a young boy is able to ride the sun horse. Of course, a number of boys don't survive the ritual. The chosen one is born with the ability to survive the flames.

Like a Flash. Being able to blast across the desert in spectacular fashion intimidates most other creatures. Keeping up with this speedster is extremely difficult, if not impossible. Therefore, the sun horse has few rivals.

However, these are shapechangers and only appear to be meerkats. Weremeerkats are lycanthropes that inhabit the desolate land.

Diminutive Desert Dogs. The little monsters live in packs in the desert. They are very close and will fight to the death to defend the members of the colony. The lycanthropes make their homes in underground burrows with complex tunnel systems.

Stoic Sentinels. These lycanthropes are renowned for their extraordinary patience. They will wait for hours and hours, watching for the right moment to act.

Downsizing. A creature who is cursed with weremeerkat lycanthropy is in for a shock. At times, the transformations can be spontaneous.

    <description>The three-eyed Ryssarav is the most terrifying creature one could ever encounter in a swamp. This gargantuan monster stalks the foulest, gloomiest areas in the region. It is most often seen after the sun sets in the murky realm.

Bright Eyes. The first sign of the Ryssarav can appear quite harmless at night. Its three large eyes appear as lanterns bobbing in the darkness. However, these dangerous eyes can blind someone if they look at them too long.

Misty Mysteries. Since nobody actually survives a visit to the Ryssarav's swamp, its legend has grown. Some people say the monster emerges when mists cover the region. The villagers from nearby settlements avoid the area at all cost. However, an old halfling wizard has been sighted near the creature's lair.

    <description>This arrogant little wizard is a master in the School of Conjuration. Long ago, Merric fled from his wealthy family and took up residence in a small shack in the swamp. He continued his studies, sneaking back into lizardfolk caves to get what spell components he couldn't find himself.

Aristocrat Gone Wild. At first the wizard hated the living conditions in the swamp and wouldn't have wished it on his worst enemy. But over time Merric has grown to love the region. His henchman, a nasty orc warrior named Rogvar, is always at his side.

Odd Couple. Merric is a companion of the titan known as the Ryssarav. He seems to be the only one who can communicate with the legendary monster.

    <description>A concerned paladin counts all his party members as they emerge from a trek through the swamp. The adventurers realize one companion is missing. Then their bearded leader notices several spikes in the cleric's chain mail. Frowning, the older man declares that a bog hopper is at work.

Swamp Stalker. This odd fey creature spends its time hunting in swampy terrain. It is a carnivore and will feed on insects, beasts, humanoids, and any other available meat. They can attack with their horn, jaws, or by shooting poisonous spikes.

Dark Cover. Bog hoppers prefer to hunt in dimly lit areas or at night. These stealthy monsters like to lurk in the water or thick foliage and listen for the movements of any prey.

Wild Fey. Scholars believe that bog hoppers crossed into the world from Feyland. Most experts think the fey horrors came through a Riftgate or one of the other entrances to the fey world. The phrase "those crazy boggers" comes from dealings with these peculiar creatures.

    <description>A duchess walks through her opulent gardens after returning from a long voyage. Her companions haven't noticed a drastic change, a permanent sly smile has appeared on her face. She is the victim of a clone shroom, and a monster has taken her place.

Magic Mushroom. It is an evil, magical plant that creates a duplicate of a good-aligned humanoid. Exact copies of their former selves, the clones are as evil as the clever plant. The fiendish fungus then sends the duplicate back into the world to seed chaos.

Dark Shadows. These curious plants live in the shade in bogs, fens, and swamps. They appear to be identical to other giant mushrooms in the region.

    <description>Deep inside the darkest, most sinister swamp lives the Crocodile Queen. Luckily very few humanoids will ever come into contact with her. However, she will sneak into human settlements and take what she wants. Every few years she will steal a baby girl. A week later, the Crocodile Queen will give birth to a daughter and replace the stolen child. Once her daughter transforms into a hag at thirteen years-old, the queen will decide whether or not she'll raise her.

Swamp Hag. The Crocodile Queen is a wicked, ancient creature. Extremely arrogant, she is confident that nobody will challenge her for control of the expansive swamp.

Creepy Court. Her lair is an eerie cave located far off the beaten track. Giant undead crocodiles (page 83), giant crocodiles, evil druids, evil necromancers, and other creatures patrol her territory.

    <description>Swimming through the swamp is an extremely large creature. Although most of it is below the surface, its large, domed patterned shell is still visible. The demon turtle blends in especially well in murky swamps. Sometimes these fiends are mistaken for large mounds of earth.

Shell Shocked. Their distinctive shell patterns can warn of danger but are often covered by dirt. The shell is extremely strong and provides the monster with ample protection.

Toxic Turtle. Most demon turtles have been found in warm swamps, but they have been discovered in other regions as well. They are survivors and use violence to get what they want.

Swamp Snacks. Demon turtles feed on whatever they can find in the gloomy region. They usually take over an entire swamp and live at its center.

Something Familiar. Evil Kneasel used to be the trusted familiar of Oswald Myrr. He enjoyed his place in one of the legendary wizard's towers.

Appetite for Destruction. Evil is a reckless individual and doesn't worry about his safety. If his twisted mind thinks of something crazy, he'll try it.

Riftgate Rascal. After he escaped from Oswald's tower, the weasel headed for the closest Riftgate. Having no fear, Evil Kneasel raced through the portal and now travels around the World of Myrr.

    <description>Something enormous swims towards a hunter's boat. Feeling quite worried, the man starts rowing frantically in the opposite direction. He knows he just saw a giant undead crocodile.

Repulsive Reptile. Necromancers loyal to the Crocodile Queen create these hideous monsters. Many of the disgusting creatures encircle her territory.

Creepy Creature. Lizardfolk abhor these mutant reptiles and will attack them on sight. The reptilian humanoids feel these monsters are twisted versions of sacred beasts and must be destroyed.

Undead Nature. The undead crocodile doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>The Marsh Hulk was exiled to Hell many years ago by a powerful paladin. Eventually it discovered a Riftgate and returned to its home world. It is an ugly, loathsome fiend bent on revenge. Even the sight of the monster causes most creatures to flee.

Party Crasher. Perpetually angry and resentful, this fiend hates celebrations of any kind. It will creep into these joyous events and viciously attack all the participants.

Home Cooking. The tormented fiend still lives at home with its mother. They live in an underground cave near a gloomy swamp. The two fiends swim through the murky waters and search for prey.

    <description>Living on the remote continent of Tyranos are a race of strange reptilian humanoids. Even though salamans are smaller than some of the terrifying monsters in the wilderness, they have gained more and more power.

Smart Salamanders. These humanoids are clever, disciplined, and are able to use many tools. They live in stone and mud buildings in the steamy jungle. Part of these areas are underwater as the humanoids live on land and in the water. The lairs are filled with living quarters, dining chambers, storage rooms, and sacred spaces.

Lizardfolk Rivals. Salamans hate all lizardfolk and are involved in a seemingly endless war with them. Both races control large parts of the lost world of Tyranos. However, large reptilian creatures make the land a challenging place to live.

    <description>In the dark underground temples of the salaman, strange rituals are actively taking place. Leading these rites is their resourceful king.

Lead Lizard. This king usually works cooperatively with a council of salaman elders. However, he will decide to make his own decisions if it suits him.

War Council. The salaman king leads his troops in battle and they attack in an organized fashion. An endless war rages with the lizardfolk and the salaman are always on guard. Many assassins have been sent by their enemy to eliminate the slippery sovereign.

Sunken Temple. The salaman king lives in a large, sunken stone temple. Reptiles and many salaman guard their supreme leader.

Strange Ways. Salaman shaman surprise other salamans constantly with their unusual behaviors. The wise humanoids make the most unusual sounds and facial expressions. They always laugh at the wrong point when someone else is telling a story.

Jungle Alchemy. Many different poisons and unusual substances are used by these shamans. They always poison their weapons with toxins they find in the wilderness.

  The screech leech can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. It does so after it drains 15 hit points of blood from the target or the target dies. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the screech leech.</text>

    <description>Swimming in a swamp might not be the best idea. Especially when the screech leech is around. This blood-thirsty beast is always on the hunt in swamps, rivers, and lakes.

Born Sucker. These monsters feed on the blood of any creature they can find. Screech leeches can also send out a piercing cry to stun victims.

Armed to the Teeth. Gifted with razor sharp teeth, these beasts drain a large amount of blood in a short period of time. If one attaches itself to another creature the host is very aware of its presence. Finding one of these large leeches on one's body is a very unpleasant experience.

Shocking Sounds. Some monster hunters say that the screech leech's spooky call is worse than its bite. A few alchemists are reported to use these beasts to make healing potions.

    <description>Cattle are dead, the food stores have been robbed. Odd tracks lead into the nearby swamp. Everyone suspects the swamp creature is active in their area.

Rotten Roots. This evil creature brings all kinds of misery when it makes a home near a settlement. Once a young druid, it was cursed by dark energies from a Riftgate. Now it has become a monster, part human and part plant.

Stealthy Survivor. The swamp creature is trying to survive, trapped in a nightmare. It can assume its human shape and slip into almost any community. At times it changes into its plant form spontaneously. It loses more of its mind every day it is under the curse.

Lost Boy. Many scholars debate about the origins of this strange monster. Nobody realizes it was created because of a Riftgate. The young man's family is still hunting for their lost son.

    <description>Living in the most remote of forests is a powerful titan. It closely resembles a giant beast. However, this is no beast, but a terrifying monstrosity known as the Arborian.

Towering Titan. Most creatures that encounter the Arborian flee at the sight of it. It is so tall it dwarfs any giants. The creature can see above the canopy and is able to see survey the area for miles.

All Time High. The Arborian breathes out a strange, colorful cloud. It is filled with gas that causes euphoria. These strange fumes make victims act in abnormal ways.

Resting Place. The Arborian sleeps underneath an enormous, old tree deep in the woods. Beasts and forest dwellers make sure to stay far away from the titan. Rolen Xiloscient (page 94), a powerful elf mage, is the only creature on good terms with this terror.

      <text>As an action, he can choose one creature that he can see within 5 feet of him. If the target can see or hear him, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against DC 18 or be charmed by him until the end of his next turn. The charmed creature's speed drops to 0, and the creature is incapacitated and visibly dazed.
On subsequent turns, he can use his action to maintain this effect, extending its duration until the end of his next turn. However, the effect ends if he moves more than 5 feet away from the creature, if the creature can neither see nor hear him, or if the creature takes damage.
Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its initial saving throw against this effect, he can't use this feature on that creature again until he finishes a long rest.</text>

    <description>This opinionated, aggressive elf doesn't back down from anyone. He is a master of the School of Enchantment. Rolen spends much of his time experimenting with magic in his forest home.

Aloof Elf. The high elf isn't too interested in the opinions of others. He doesn't get along with many of the other members of the Wizard Council. Rolen doesn't even keep a home in Zogg anymore, preferring to live in the woods on the beautiful continent of Naern.

    <description>Adventurers head to their tents after a delicious meal. As they are beginning to lie down for the night, the ranger in their party hears an unusual raven's call. He shouts a warning to his companions, "something wicked is coming this way!"

Wild Witch. Baba Yaga is one of the most famous witches in the world. The cunning, clever old woman is hideously ugly. Some say she is related to hags as she enjoys dining on humanoids.

The Little Grandmother. Even though she is truly a horrifying monster, many folks seek her out. Baba Yaga's wisdom is legendary, and sages, scholars, and explorers seek her advice. However, there is a price to be paid for her assistance. The witch will ask for a favor in return, usually in the form of a dangerous quest.

    <description>A clump of trees is parted on the edge of the woods and a wooden hut with long chicken legs appears. It pauses for a moment and then races through the woods. This is Baba Yaga's hut, the mobile home of the infamous witch.

Dead and Breakfast. Some legends speak of people who found their way into the hut and never came out. Whether these unfortunates died, or if they're still inside is an open question.

Spacious Home. Baba Yaga's Hut is filled with numerous chambers, as well as her minions. It is much larger inside than it appears on the outside. There are sleeping quarters, sitting rooms, grand halls, gardens, servants' quarters, alchemical storage rooms, and more.

Mortar and Pestle. The witch also stores her magical mortar inside her hut. When Baba Yaga flies around in this smaller construct, she sweeps the air with a birch broom to cover up the tracks she leaves behind.

    <description>While walking through the woods a sense of uneasiness fills your gut. Then you notice shadows around you seem to be moving independently. The cleric in your adventuring party suspects that the black stag is near. Then the druid notices that something is wrong with the trees and plants.

Double Trouble. These evil fey usually spread fear and hate in the darkest part of Feyland. However, some have now passed through Riftgates into the ordinary world.

Sickening Shadows. When a black stag arrives, forests start to rot and turn an inky, black color. After they've decomposed, the cruel fey will search for new woods to corrupt and destroy.

Horrible Henchmen. At times evil druids and other nefarious characters fall into league with this fey. If it's in a good mood, the black stag will even let these villains use it as a mount.

    <description>Legend says fey energies passed through a Riftgate and blessed a baby. The child was imbued by these forces and born a fey. Briar Moon is destined to cleanse the wilderness of evil. She was feared by those in her village because of strange events surrounding her birth. Her home was then destroyed by cultists, and she was hidden away by forest creatures.

Wild Guardian. Briar Moon has fled into the wilderness to fulfill her destiny. She is deeply connected to nature and fearlessly fights evil of any kind.

Natural Warrior. Seeing herself as part of the natural world, Briar is at home in the wild. She uses her magic and her powerful sword against evil foes. The Sword of Power is legendary and many creatures would love to get their hands on it.

    <description>Climbing over a large fallen tree, a party of heroes moves cautiously through the forest. The paladin lifts the halfling rogue over the natural obstacle. Just then, a gnome druid sees something out of the corner of his eye. He thought he saw a creeping shadow, one of the last creatures one would ever want to lay their eyes on.

Stealthy Stalker. These callous undead monsters hunt down their prey in the shadowy regions of the woods. The creeping shadow will track its victims for hours, days, or weeks. It is very patient and will wait for just the right moment to strike.

Shady Character. This creature is usually created to hunt someone by a necromancer, witch, or hag. However, the creeping shadow is a coward and will flee any fight that isn't going its way.

Lost Souls. This undead horror is made from the souls of those who perished in the darkest areas of the forest. Some folks swear they hear many different voices coming from the monster.

Undead Nature. The creeping shadow doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>Tons of flying insects pour into a cluster of tents, chasing away the inhabitants. Appearing out of thin air in the clearing, a dimspriggan begins ripping people to shreds.

Grove Guardian. Most dimspriggans are found in ruins guarding a hoard of treasure. As the guardian of the treasure, they will kill anyone who enters their territory. They are wicked, mischievous fey who also enjoy spreading misery and destruction. Dimspriggans love chasing newcomers out of the woods, making sure the scared explorers will never return again.

Dark Cloud. The clouds of insects breathed out by dimspriggans make a great deal of noise. Deep, buzzing sounds continue to haunt any survivors long after an encounter with these fey.

    <description>Several brownies are picking glowing berries in the woods. One of them hears a branch break and alerts the others. Then they see it. A horned creature is slowing creeping through the dense foliage towards them. "It's the Faun of the Dead!" screams one of the little fey and they all faint.

Broken Heart. The faun had a fallout with his family and then its lover married someone else. An emotional wreck, it wandered into the most dangerous part of the woods. Zombies quickly killed it and a fey necromancer raised it to join the evil Unseelie Court.

New World. Stumbling around Feyland, the monster accidentally passed through a Riftgate into the ordinary world. It is even more confused now, lost in an alien landscape. Its beautiful, yet sad memories of Feyland still rest within its tortured soul.

Scary Faerie. The faun is on the war path and won't stop until it is destroyed. Most creatures in the forest will flee the moment they see it.

Undead Nature. The faun doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>The sound of large wings flapping cuts through the night air. Other creatures in the forest are alerted that a gloom owl is on the move. Small beasts scatter, looking for cover from the dangerous predator.

Aggressive Fey. Gloom owls are extremely aggressive and act in a hostile fashion to every creature except grim squirrels (page 103). The tiny fey warriors help the owls hunt for food and have been loyal to them for many years.

Air Cavalry. These creatures are allies of the evil squirrels and work together to create a formidable air force. The sight of dive-bombing owls with squirrel riders can scare much bigger creatures. Two or three of the squirrels usually ride each owl.

Tree House. Gloom Owls make their homes in large cavities of huge trees. Some of these homes are also filled with the remains of their victims and hidden treasures.

    <description>A group of fey warriors walks quietly through the moonlit woods. They watch a nearby elf village and signal two scouts to move into position. Grim squirrels are raiding the village in the middle of the night. Elves, humans, halflings, orcs, goblins, and many other humanoids hate these unpleasant little creatures.

Fearless Fey. Grim squirrels are often underestimated. The tiny fey are rather dangerous in large groups. Armed with swords and slings, the squirrels take on much larger foes.

Hidden Hideouts. These evil fey live in hollow trees and have their headquarters in a large burrow. They carefully store their food and treasure and have enough extra supplies to stay in their lair for a long time.

Flying Mounts. Noble and elite warriors ride gloom owls as their mounts. The bold owls enable these dark fey to conduct daring raids.

Otherworldly Creature. This monster is not from the ordinary world. The Mothman passed through one of Oswald Myrr's Riftgates and got lost.

Mind-Altering. There is no doubt the monster is dangerous, but the most horrifying effect is psychological. Somehow the Mothman is able to enter the minds of multiple creatures and torment them.

Homesick Horror. The Mothman longs to return home to its world. It has attempted to use Riftgates to get there. But the portals are rare, and the creature can't seem to find its way home. It has become frustrated and plans to enlist the aid of a spellcaster.

Off the Beaten Path. These fey often surprise travelers on remote forest trails. Phookas move through the trees and spy on their victims before they reveal themselves. However, the form they choose won't be anything like their true self.

Terrible Trickster. This creature enjoys playing elaborate jokes on humanoids. They will be patient and draw their victims into difficult situations.

Rocky Ride. One of the phooka's favorite trick is talking a humanoid into riding them in horse form. The fey takes the foolish victim on a wild, dangerous ride and then returns them back to the place they started from.

    <description>The most dangerous trickster in the woods is the Pumpkin King. He rules a gloomy, eerie forest far from most settlements. This fey is like an out-of-control teenager and causes chaos wherever he goes. In one hand he wields a great black scythe, in his other he holds a flaming pumpkin.

Forgotten Fey. The pumpkin king longs to return to Feyland and the Unseelie Court. He was banished long ago for challenging the power of the Queen of the Darkness.

Rotten Plans. Together with his minions, the king wants to spread darkness from his forest across the world. Until he can return home, he wants to create a never-ending dark wood.

Dark Castle. Several oddballs have joined the pumpkin king in a bizarre version of a royal court. Black stags, other evil fey, rogues, and foul spellcasters have allied with the pumpkin king. They live together in an abandoned castle far from any forest trails.

    <description>Numerous boulders are smashed to pieces as a gigantic creature smashes through the wilderness. Its five heads look in every direction. Several halfling scouts flee with looks of utter terror on their little faces. Charging over the hills after them is the massive five-headed monster. The Hakkon is the largest creature known to exist in the hills.

Seismic Shift. When the bulky Hakkon is on the move, the ground shakes. Many inhabitants in the hills believe these monstrosities are responsible for earthquakes. Even the beasts in the area will run for their lives when the titan arrives.

Clash of the Titans. This monster is rumored to be from a faraway land. Oswald Myrr found evidence that numerous titans have arrived from this mysterious realm. The wizard knows that it would be disastrous if more creatures like the Hakkon entered the world.

    <description>Jacob is a soft-spoken member of the Wizard Council. He is incredibly calm and doesn't speak much. The old wizard is a master of the School of Necromancy.

Undead Army. Jacob has ambitious plans. However, he is extremely patient. The necromancer has been creating an unseen army for over thirty years. It now contains wights, zombies, ogre zombies, skeletons, and numerous other undead abominations. He has also begun to communicate with the Hakkon and hopes it will join his army.

Hilltop Headquarters. Jacob lives in a hilltop wilderness compound. Inside is a beautiful manor, barracks for his undead soldiers, stables, a forge, and an armory. Hidden underground passages lead to tunnels that can access different areas in the hills. The entire place is built to withstand an attack by a large military force.

Wild Man. The Beastmaster usually appears as a strongly built man with a black beard and long black hair. He resides in a large home in the hills.

Wilderness Home. Many animals live at the Beastmaster's wooden lodge. Dogs, goats, sheep, and other beasts live with the solitary human. However, they are no ordinary beasts. Their time with the extraordinary shapechanger has raised their awareness and intellectual capacity.

Friends in Need. A few adventurers have sought refuge at the Beastmaster's lodge. These heroes reported that the shapechanger was a kind but aloof host.

    <description>Goats are one of the oldest domesticated animals in the world. Their milk, skin, meat, and fur have been used for many years to support humanoid communities. This goat is an exception, a horrifying fiend that prowls the hills.

Horned Horror. Like other goats, these monsters will eat absolutely anything and everything. Searching through the contents of their stomachs one can discover coins or even magic items.

Night Terror. The demon goat is most active at night. Hiding in the inky blackness it can surprise most prey because of its ability to see in the dark.

Alchemical Aids. Some witches, hags, cultists, and alchemists use the parts of a demon goat to create bizarre potions. Its milk is said to enable the drinker to speak Abyssal for a day. At times, evildoers will hire an unsuspecting party to kill a demon goat in order to use the fiend as an alchemical resource.

    <description>Several people have gone missing from an isolated village in the hills. The only clues are large rabbit-like footprints in the mud. An elder says she believes a grabbit is at work. The giant purple fey are a sight to behold, however many folks don't believe the stories about them.

Kidnapping Rabbits. These foul fey are infamous for kidnapping people from rural areas. They are often hired by witches, hags, necromancers, and other evildoers.

Disappearing Act. The grabbit is able to get around by using its ability to turn invisible. Many villagers question their vision when they see the giant purple rabbit suddenly appear in front of them.

Feared Fey. Other fey aren't fond of these cowardly scoundrels. The Seelie Court sends out fey rangers to hunt them down when they're spotted. At times, the trackers will follow grabbits into the ordinary world.

    <description>A storm crackles over large, rolling hills. Thunder booms and lightning paints the sky. Suddenly, one of the hills begins to move. A creature had been lying down on the crest and it slowly stands up. The grim giant uses the terrain of this region to hide its bulk.

Mister Crouch. These giants can crouch down on the top of hills for hours and hours. They are smarter than most their kind and are very aware of their surroundings.

Surprise Party. Grim giants will often ambush caravans of wagons or attack villages at night. They are more aggressive than most of their giant cousins.

Hungry Hunters. Able to hunt large prey, these giants are a threat to the entire region. However, if they can't find bigger prey, they will eat cattle, horses, and other beasts.

    <description>Years ago, an evil noble sold his soul to a devil. During his life he did monstrous things, including killing his wife. The night he died; a large black dog appeared outside his tomb. This is the hill hound, created by a devil from the twisted soul of the evil man. Distant howls and strange sightings haunt the area near the man's country estate.

Devilish Deeds. When the noble had gained assistance from the fiend, his soul was the eternal payment. Now in its undead form, the hound carries out the wishes of the nefarious devil.

Family Curse. What the noble didn't know was the deal included all of his family. He didn't read the fine print in the contract. Now all his family and future generations come back from the dead as hill hounds.

Moor Problems. These hounds are active on a particularly gloomy moor with imposing hills. Gray clouds seem to hang permanently over the place. The barren land is also dotted with patches of dangerous quicksand.

Undead Nature. A hill hound doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>The Hunter arrived in this world from a faraway land. It crossed through a Riftgate into the hills. A highly intelligent, resourceful monster; it has quickly left a trail of destruction in its wake. It is eager to find any way back home.

Six-Legged Freak. It has six legs and can stand up on its back two legs. The Hunter is also able to use its front two legs to manipulate objects. It is naturally a subterranean creature and lives in an extensive underground lair. At times it will keep victims tied up in the massive cavern. An intricate system of tunnels enables it to travel around the region.

Unwanted Disruptions. The Hunter is able to harness psionic power to disrupt ranged weapons and spells. Archers and spellcasters are very surprised when encountering this monster.

    <description>A party of adventurers flees for their lives, screaming as they run over the crest of a hill. Pursuing them are a pack of bizarre monsters blasting them with red rays from their eyes. Rampaging jackolopses have scared the living daylights out of the heroes.

Rampant Rabbit. The chaotic, killer rabbits can cause pandemonium when they arrive on the scene. Working with others of their kind, they are formidable opponents. Some evildoers have begun to use packs of jackolopses to protect their territories.

One-Eyed Menace. Jackolops can take over large parts of the hills. They are a threat to hunters and farmers alike. Their homes are large hidden burrows, although their sentries can give away the location.

Odd Origin. Some folks believe these monsters were banished from Feyland. Others believe they hail from another plane of existence. There are also rumors that jackolops were created by Oswald Myrr to guard his many properties.

    <description>One of the most unusual creatures to encounter in a lake or river is the kelpie. This dark horse appears harmless at first glance. However, the nasty fey will attempt to drown anyone who gets close. Its true form is a fey humanoid that appears quite human.

Soaked to the Bone. When in horse form it always appears wet. In addition, the humanoid form of the kelpie has smooth, wet, and cold skin. These are clues that point to the creature's true nature.

Bridled Rage. Some humanoids will attempt to ride these fey. This is a challenging task and can result in the rider being drowned. If a kelpie is successfully tamed, it only lasts for a brief period of time.

Water Horses. Horses born from the mating of kelpies and horses can breathe underwater.

    <description>A strange water dragon lives near lakes and rivers. The monster is known as a knucker and its home is called a knuckerhole. These round holes are filled with water, and nobody has ever discovered how deep they are.

Perpetual Pandemonium. The water dragons eat livestock, beasts, and humanoids. They don't usually live too far from humanoid settlements so they can have access to a constant supply of food.

Foggy Ideas. Knuckers are able to breathe out a large cloud of fog. This makes it very difficult to see anything and the monster can make its escape if necessary.

Unwanted Attention. Most of these dragons found near rural communities get a lot of attention. Townsfolk will organize and send out armed militia to deal with the threat. They often attempt to destroy the monster's knuckerhole.

    <description>Hidden on hills or in open fields are a strange type of fey. Odd sods resemble a clump of grass and dirt with two legs. They will often be found in large numbers, burying their feet in the ground and appearing to be ordinary wild grass.

Natural Wisdom. Odd sods aren't very bright, but they are wiser than you'd imagine. They are rather perceptive and use their instincts to survive.

Strange Sounds. This creature makes sounds like frogs, crickets, and other small beasts. If those creatures wander too close, they become a tasty meal.

Hidden from View. Odd sods will also feed on beasts from the surrounding area. They will eat cattle, rabbits, badgers, and rodents. Some farming communities have been decimated by these monsters. The cause of such attacks can go undiscovered for months, or even years.

    <description>As the sun shines down, a group of travelers rests on the shore of a peaceful lake. Suddenly a piercing scream fills the air. One of their companions disappears under the water, struggling for their life. A sinker has grabbed another innocent victim. 

Bottom Feeder. These disgusting fey live on the bottom of lakes and constantly hunt for new sources of food. They walk around, watching creatures swimming above them. Then they'll reach up with their long arms and grab their prey.

Surprise Attack. Hiding in the lake, sinkers are able to surprise the majority of their victims. They will often blend in with underwater plants such as reeds and other grasses.

Out of Sight. Sinkers make their lairs in many different places. Some sinkers live in sunken boats, others live in caves dug into the side of riverbanks.

    <description>Hiding in a small, abandoned village seemed like a good idea. However, something is obviously wrong. Strange groaning sounds can be heard throughout the rural settlement. Then the adventuring party begins to see humanoid shapes moving in the moonlight. A swarm of zombies has attacked the village.

Wave after Wave. The walking dead will raid wilderness settlements, causing absolute chaos. At times, several swarms of zombies will work together.

Resourceful Raiders. Zombies can attack by slamming body parts into their opponents. However, the undead monsters will also pick up objects to use as improvised weapons. Some will even use limbs from other zombies or other humanoids.

Mission Control. Most swarms are mindless and just wander aimlessly. There are also swarms under the control of necromancers or other foul beings.

Undead Nature. A swarm of zombies doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>This trickster fey lives in remote parts of the hills. They are small fey and have been mistaken for brownies or gnomes before.

Nocturnal Nightmares. Trow are nocturnal and aren't usually seen during the day. They are also quite introverted and don't like to socialize. However, many are able to infiltrate humanoid communities and spread fake news. The tricksters have even spread false rumors that it is dangerous to see trow or even to speak about them.

Music Lovers. All trow enjoy music, especially performances with string music. Now and then, they will kidnap talented bards and keep them for personal entertainment. Some of these musicians are never seen again. Other bards return to their communities, unable to remember what happened to them.

Mound on the Moors. Most trow make their homes in earthen mounds in the hills. Other creatures that live nearby, such as badgers and foxes, can't stand the little troublemakers. They detest the noises and odors that come from the trow lairs.

    <description>A posse of small humanoids riding sturdy boar rides over a nearby hill. They chase a group of frightened goblins. Halfling cowboys often ride these war boars as mounts.

Tough-Skinned. These beasts are tough and can be ridden over long distances. They are also surprisingly quick on their feet. Their halfling riders choose the toughest, strongest boars they can find. To give them more protection, their riders fit them with studded leather armor.

Rough Riders. A number of farms and ranches have war boar patrols and others end up in elite cavalry units. They were originally wild beasts and some don't enjoy the civilized life. There are stories of war boars going wild and rampaging through farms and ranches.

Favored Food. War boars usually feed on nuts, berries, seeds, roots, bark, leaves, earthworms, frogs, rodents, lizards, and snakes. However, they will take on larger prey.

    <description>Fire and smoke pour from a mountaintop. Villagers flee as they fear the gigantic volcano. However, this time it is even worse than an eruption. A titan known as Volcan has awoken.

Formidable Foe. This monstrosity is a walking volcano and destruction is the only thing it knows. The titan hurls fireballs, smashes with fiery fists, and breathes out poisonous gases.

Reign of Fire. The only being that seems to calm the inferno is the dwarf Aimar (page 132). If it wasn't for the wizened wizard, this monster might just destroy the world. It is an almost unstoppable force once it arrives on the scene.

Lava Homeland. Volcan enjoys its home in the volcanic region of the world. It bathes in lava and rests on the sides of mountains. Fire elementals, salamanders, and mephits are often found nearby.

    <description>Living in a cabin high up the mountains is a wise old dwarf wizard. Aimar the Seer watches the world from above. The ancient dwarf is a master of the School of Divination.

View from the Top. His great view matches his extraordinary vision. He seems able to know of events happening all around the world. Aimar travels regularly from his small cottage in Zogg to his mountaintop home on Ma Zaan by using a Riftgate.

Ancient Knowledge. Sage and kind, this dwarf is often sought after for advice. Good-aligned beings will even travel from other continents to visit the seer. The mountain Aimar lives on is extremely difficult to traverse. A long winding path is the only route to the top and numerous monsters inhabit the area.

    <description>Some folks wonder what's worse than a cyclops. The gregarious two-headed biclops is the answer. The strange giants are extremely rare and lair in mountain ranges near humanoid settlements. Some scholars believe these giants are a result of cyclopes breeding with ettins.

Double Vision. Biclopes are much more capable than their one-eyed cousins. They are brighter and usually find a large, well-protected cave to live in. Wanting to gather as many minions as possible, these creatures seek areas filled with other monsters and humanoids.

Social Network. Unlike some giants, biclops are rather social and enjoy the company of other creatures. They often have hill giants, ogres, and orcs in their large social circle. The two-headed giants have great senses of humor and are popular with most giants.

Cozy Caverns. Biclopes' caves are lined with large furs to keep the giants warm. Large sacks filled with food and treasures are usually hidden nearby.

    <description>A grappling hook attaches onto the stone ledge above. Several dwarf scouts continue their ascent up a rock face. All of a sudden, a bizarre, winged creature crawled out of a cave and heads towards them. The surprising cliffhanger can ruin someone's day.

Mountain Menace. Clinging to the sheer face of mountains, cliffhangers look for any prey they can find. These fey feed on birds, rodents, goats, and other creatures.

Rock Climber. Adept at moving around exceptionally steep terrain, cliffhangers can live anywhere in the mountains. Some expert climbers have even begun to study their techniques. Of course, the climbers will be in trouble if they get too close.

New Land. Cliffhangers are originally from Feyland. Over time they have adapted to their new home. They speak Terran now and have forgotten how to speak Sylvan.

    <description>Finding a way through the mountains can be challenging. This undead monster makes the journey even more difficult. It lies in wait for prey, indistinguishable from an ordinary mountain path.

Terrible Trap. Mountain passes and picturesque trails through meadows are just some of their favorite haunts. However, deadly paths are most active on cloudy days or at night.

Perilous Path. This monster surprises its victims and wraps itself around their bodies. Then the undead horror will squeeze its prey to death. Afterwards it will drag the victim into a cave and devour it.

Undead Nature. The deadly path doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

Shocking Surprise. Most creatures can't believe their eyes when they discover one of these unique fey. If a fire dancer stands still in a fire, it can blend in with the flames.

Foul Fey. These fey creatures love to play tricks on those who venture into the mountains. Some of their nasty games end in disaster.

Harsh Hearth. On rare occasions, fire dancers can also be found indoors. As they enjoy hot flames, they have been known to live in fireplaces.

    <description>The most secretive member of the Alliance of the Griffon is its leader. The Griffon is a powerful celestial who lives in a cloud castle high above the everyday world. Most creatures never see this being or his fantastical abode.

Good versus Evil. There are about a dozen members in the mysterious faction. They fight evil throughout the multiverse.

Divine Intervention. Dealing with the forces of darkness is a constant struggle for this celestial and his followers. He sends the heroes on quests suited to their talents.

Cloud Castle. A Riftgate is located at the center of his cloud fortress. The Griffon and his allies use the portal to travel around the multiverse.

    <description>A bright flash of green light can be seen up in the mountains. All the villagers down below know a grim roc is in the area. This undead monster is one of the most dangerous creatures in the world. Its enormous shadow and glowing green eyes strike fear into the hearts of those who dwell in the mountains.

Winged Horror. When the Riftgates were opened, several dead rocs arose as these monsters. Malevolent necrotic energies reanimated the creatures. The massive evil bird can destroy a city on its own. It simply annihilates everything in its path.

Distant Peaks. Grim rocs live high up in the mountains and can take over large portions of the world. Only the bravest adventurers will go on quests to deal with this menace.

Undead Nature. The grim roc doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>Looking down from his pegasus, a paladin sees a bizarre sight. Racing through rivers of lava on a mountainside is a large dog-like monster. The bulky yellow and black creature seems unaffected by the searing hot temperatures.

Peak Experiences. Living in a volcano is a harsh life. However, for an elemental from a fiery world it feels just right. It is unlikely that this elemental will be found far from a volcano.

Lava their Owners. A number of lava dogs have become companions for fire giants. They are highly sought after by giants to guard their lairs.

Hot-Tempered. Although some are trained by fire giants, these monsters are generally in a bad mood. It doesn't take much to get a lava dog enraged.

    <description>One monster that came through the Riftgates still haunts their thresholds. Rift wraiths prey on creatures on either side of the portals. They are formed from the tormented souls of creatures that didn't survive the trip through a Riftgate. These undead appear in mountainous regions more than any other part of the wilderness.

Cursed Threshold. The area around the Riftgates is usually shrouded in dim light and shadows move in strange ways. Plants don't grow near the portals, and many believe it's because of the presence of rift wraiths.

Vampiric Vultures. These horrors can sense living creatures and feed off their energy. Rift wraiths drain the life out of their victims.

Undead Nature. A rift wraith doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>Stoneshapers are rare fey that can alter their forms in many ways. In their true form, they appear as a tall, gray humanoid. Living deep in the mountains, they are rarely ever seen.

Enemy Mine. Stoneshapers don't approve of anyone or anything digging into the earth and treating it as a resource. They will do whatever they can to disrupt and destroy any mining or construction operations. Some mines have hired guards to try to deal with stoneshapers.

Down to Earth. These fey can shapechange into a rock or a stony humanoid. Stoneshapers are very good at traversing the mountain region. They can even burrow through solid rock.

    <description>Tales are told of a giant cat who appears during mountain storms. Living far away from most other creatures is the mysterious thunder paw. This monstrosity is from another land and crossed over through one of Oswald Myrr's Riftgates.

Ferocious Feline. The thunder paw is heavily built and won't back down from any opponent. They are wild, unpredictable monsters that enjoy their freedom.

Silent Stalker. These monstrosities are able to move quickly and quietly, especially adept at hiding in the mountains. With the ability to see in the dark, they can go almost anywhere. The stealthy creatures are known to ambush unsuspecting travellers on mountain paths.

Cat Cave. Thunder paws live in hidden caves. They use furs to line their lair and sleep most of the day.
