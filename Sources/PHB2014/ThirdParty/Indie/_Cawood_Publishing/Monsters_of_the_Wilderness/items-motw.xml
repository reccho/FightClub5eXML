    <range>40/120</range>
    <text>Ammo: sling bullet

This item resembles an ordinary pumpkin, which you can activate with a magic word. Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 40/120 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage and 7 (2d6) fire damage.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Proficiency: simple, sling
