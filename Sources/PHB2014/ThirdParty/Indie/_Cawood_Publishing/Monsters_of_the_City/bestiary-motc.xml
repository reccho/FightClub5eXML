    <description>The Castle District is heavily influenced by a devil known as Pride. She appears as a spiderlike fiend who prowls around in an immense castle. Held in her grasp are large needles that she can use to knit or attack. She is a spoiled princess with an enormous ego. Completely blind to her faults, this proud devil is supremely confident and bold.

Precious Princess. The fiendish princess feels she deserves to be pampered and worshipped. Pride is notorious for hosting wild, bawdy parties in her sprawling castle. She desperately needs to be the center of attention. Many minions serve the obnoxious monster; including other fiends, nobles, anti-paladins, consorts, and many kinds of spiders.

Arrogant Aristocrat. Pride feels she is the smartest, most beautiful being in the multiverse. Her many admirers in the district help perpetuate this fantasy. Invitations to her balls are treasured by many within the nobility.

Successful Spinster. Most of the upper-class have their clothes made by Pride. The vestments have beautiful web-like designs, but come with strings attached.

    <description>Acting as a counterbalance to the fiendish Pride, is the celestial known as Humility. This divine creature appears as an old, dishevelled man clad in robes and wielding a wooden staff. Even though he lives a simple life, he prefers to reside in the Castle District. This is where he feels he can make the biggest difference. Humility wants to influence leaders and other high-ranking citizens.

In This Together. He is a divine being and knows that everyone and every thing have more similarities than differences. This celestial doesn't treat anyone, or any thing differently. Humility gives the same respect to the king as he does to a peasant.

Simple Life. Although he lives in the wealthy Castle District, Humility usually sleeps on a bench in one of the gorgeous gardens. Most of the nobles ignore him as they go about their busy lives. Little do they know a divine being is living right under their noses.

Down To Earth. Legends say that Humility once had wings but he gave them up to live a more ordinary life. This celestial enjoys meeting the citizens of the city and can count on hundreds of them if he needs to. If he sees someone in need, he will take action in a subtle manner.

    <description>Riding astride a black, fiery steed is a fearsome dark knight. Anxious peasants avert their eyes, knowing to look an anti-paladin in the eye might be the last thing they do. In fact, few creatures will dare to go near these warriors. They use violence to further their cause and are capable of almost anything.

Unholy Knight. The terrible foe is the opposite of the divine paladin. Anti-paladins are unholy warriors often aligned with devils and other lawful evil creatures. Some of these warriors command legions of undead monsters.

Above the Fray. These proud knights usually live in large manors or castles. They live away from the common folk and consider themselves superior to ordinary citizens. Many of these warriors have small armies and some even rule kingdoms of their own.

Sinister Steed. All anti-paladins have a loyal mount at their disposal. Many of these sinister knights ride nightmares or warhorses. A few have been known to ride dragons.

    <description>As laughter echoes through the king's castle, everyone knows the jester is present. Those in court are rolling on the floor laughing as the hilarious clown performs. Even the king and his close advisors are enjoying the jester's show.

Proud Clown. Jesters are usually found at court doing their best to entertain. They are supremely confident in their ability and take pride in what they do. They perform comedic shows and tell jokes about the inhabitants of the city. Although not everyone are fans of their act. Many jesters are loved by the court but others are loathed.

Fun-loving Fool. These performance artists enjoy being the center of attention. They feed off the energy from an audience and need external validation. Hiring their services can be expensive, but the jester will also perform in poorer parts of the city. Sometimes they entertain simply for fun and applause.

Skilled Scoundrel. Jesters are extremely talented rogues and can be recruited by those of good or evil alignment. One infamous jester stole a crown from a princess while performing at her castle.

Dwarf Diplomat. Only the proudest, calmest dwarves are recruited to be diplomats. Most dwarves speak their mind and aren't interested in being diplomatic. This means it is often a challenging hunt for such a recruit. Many dwarves wanting the position as an ambassador have to fight the urge to say what they feel.

Homesick Hero. Although they enjoy their duties, most of these homesick diplomats long for home. They also prefer to have their embassies built with a dungeon level and enjoy getting out of the city as often as possible.

    <description>A beautiful elf strolls through an elegant manor and meets the nobility. The proud elf ambassador knows how to work her charms in social and political circles. She moves gracefully and seems to be at ease in any environment. Some of these amiable elves are eager to use their position to advance their political ambitions.

Friendly Fey. The elf ambassador is friendlier than most of her race. Yet she is a tough negotiator and is always on the lookout for her kindred. Most elf ambassadors are very experienced and extremely resourceful.

Proud Spokesperson. Honoured to represent their people, these elves are on their best behavior. They are usually well supported by the elf kingdom and have all the gold they need. A large entourage of soldiers and other elves accompanies most elf ambassadors. Their embassies are elegant wood structures with elvish design features.

Magnificent Mounts. These ambassadors often ride splendid riding horses or giant elk.

    <description>Sitting on the throne is a withered male figure clad in long robes, wearing a shining crown. This is the frightening fallen king, an unpredictable undead monster. Pride ate away at this monarch until he lost his humanity. What is left is a shell of his former regal self, a shadowy echo of the past. 

Rotten Ruler. These leaders were killed under tragic circumstances and linger in the mortal realm. Their twisted spirits are so stubborn that they attempt to continue their former lifestyle. They still have power, even ruling some cities or kingdoms with their undead court.

Haunted Home. Residing in their former homes, fallen kings live an altered version of their old lives. Darkness has fallen on these dwellings, an evil unnatural darkness.

Miserable Minions. The fallen king has many soldiers and other minions serving him. Evil knights and undead are often found in the company of these strange sovereigns. Even dark mages and wicked priests might be members of their shadowy court.

Undead Nature. A fallen king doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>Guarding entrances to the city or gates to the Castle District itself are gatekeepers. These overweight, grumpy old men would rather nobody ever bothered them. They have very specific ideas of the kind of people they will allow inside. The cantankerous oafs are notorious for keeping out rebels and artists. Gatekeepers are usually accompanied by armed guards. Tolls charged depend on what they think of each individual.

Cold Welcome. Gatekeepers are lost in their heads and their proud hearts have grown cold. Still, one way around their icy attitudes is to give them gold. Their so-called principles vanish when gold pieces are concerned.

Taking a Toll. Holding onto their old ideas has worn out these folks. They are tired and have little patience. Some of these men have gained a small loyal following. In the eyes of their rabid followers, the gatekeeper can do no wrong.

Stout Sentinels. The old men usually spend much of their time sitting around and aren't in great shape. If they ever attempt to chase someone, they are forced to give up and try to catch their breath.

    <description>Most folks are afraid of the denizens of the undead world. However, the friendly ghost only has good intentions. This creature is destined to remain in the mortal realm and assist others. They are often found in old castles or spacious manors.

Good Ghost. These ghosts were good-aligned creatures when they died. They know they have more work to do and go about it in a humble fashion. Although they are usually found in the Castle District, they can be encountered in other parts of the city.

Protective Nature. Friendly ghosts will always protect any non-evil creatures close to them. They will even seek out those individuals who are in danger. This can complicate matters as those being protected don't always know the ghost's motives.

Undead Nature. A friendly ghost doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>The sound of beating wings alerts the castle guards to look skyward. A majestic creature, part eagle and part lion, flies up to the highest tower. A knight dismounts and then he and the humble creature bow to each other. This is the armored griffon, a powerful monstrosity that can race through the skies. They are fitted with breastplate armor and are ideally suited for combat.

Great Guardian. The bravery of the armored griffon is known throughout the kingdom. Legends tell of a griffon standing its ground against the terrifying chimera. Some cities have elite troops mounted on these creatures, forming a formidable aerial cavalry.

Pack Animal. These beasts are able to carry large amounts of equipment or goods. This is one of the many reasons that the griffons are popular with knights. Some warriors bond so closely to their flying mounts they will give their lives to protect their faithful steeds.

Loyal Mount. Armored griffons often serve as mounts to knights, paladins, and even kings and queens. Like regular griffons, these creatures enjoy feeding on horses and livestock.

    <description>A small hand is raised in a throng of people waiting outside a castle. The halfling ambassador is attempting to get an audience with the king. Other ambassadors and their retainers block the small humanoid from getting the monarch's attention. The frustrated halfling jostles with those in the crowd until the gates of the castle close.

Big Shoes to Fill. It's often hard for this diminutive diplomat to get his hairy foot in the door. He doesn't usually travel with a large entourage and often gets ignored. These small ambassadors have to persevere to get anyone's attention.

Brave Diplomat. The humble halfling diplomat is resourceful and doesn't back down. He is proud of his people and wants their interests represented.

Quick Thinker. The ambassador is quite witty and thinks well on his little feet. He is a skilled storyteller and has hundreds of tales and jokes for any occasion. Sometimes he will finish a story with a flourish by slipping on his trusty magical ring and disappearing.

    <description>One of the most polarizing figures in the city is the ogre baron. Popular with a few unethical nobles and many of the working class, this clown is loathed by the wise and educated. He has taken more and more power after running a chain of successful inns. Yet he is actually a fraud who has bullied his way to fame and fortune.

Arrogant Oaf. The proud ogre baron believes he is rather intelligent. Nothing could be further from the truth. He can barely read and gets by using his charms and intimidation. His attention is often swayed by female creatures, as he is a sucker for a pretty face. Many of his inns are staffed by beautiful young women.

Noble Friends. This ogre came to power with the help of an influential group of nobles. They ignore the ogre's cruelty, rude behavior, and xenophobia because they know the monster will further their economic and social agendas.

Angry Army. This ogre has a very committed group of angry, outraged followers. His supporters include a number of deluded priests, greedy merchants, and fiendish nobles. These deluded followers would probably support the ogre even if he killed an innocent person in broad daylight.

    <description>Tasked with the protection of the royal family is a group of elite knights. Royal knights are tough, highly trained warriors. They will often lead other knights and soldiers.

Elite Knight. These warriors are deadly swordmasters and are also adept with using ranged weapons. They are so proficient with their swords that they cannot be disarmed. Many royal knights also surprise opponents with their ability to attack with their shields.

Humble Protector. Loyal to the end, these knights will put their lives on the line. They will sacrifice themselves for others without a moment's hesitation. Of course, they will save those of noble birth before any peasants.

Royal Mounts. Royal knights ride many kinds of mounts; riding horses, warhorses, giant elk, hippogriffs, griffons, nightmares, and pegasi.

    <description>There aren't many more annoying creatures than the royal pain. This obnoxious, whiny prince is loathed by most ordinary citizens and many of those in court. The royal pain is awfully arrogant and cares only about himself. He is often found living in a large castle or elegant manor. Many servants are there to serve him, providing him with whatever he needs.

Pampered Prince. These proud princes are used to getting everything they want. If they don't get their way they usually whine and complain for hours. Yet they have a romantic side too and often end up in long-term relationships. Their naive partners generally worship the ground they walk on and join the ranks of their many servants.

Enormous Ego. The royal pain's extraordinary immaturity and egocentrism have no bounds. Heavily inflated egos give them a bizarre, skewed view of the world. They are convinced they are highly-talented individuals who deserve special treatment.

Means to an End. As long as the royal pain gets what he wants, he is briefly satisfied. He truly believes the world is there to serve him.

    <description>Some cities have a cunning evil politician running the government. The sleepless governor is a cold, calculating individual focused on power, fame, and fortune. She either rules the city on her own, or does the bidding of a monarch. An intimidating, magical longsword always sits in her scabbard.

Arrogant Administrator. The nasty governor believes she's always right and is overcome with pride. She acts decisively, doing whatever it takes to get what she wants. Although she is an intimidating presence, her large ego is quite fragile. The sleepless governor spends much of her time bossing around other bureaucrats, knights, and soldiers.

Emotionally Absent. This administrator has no connection to her heart. She is solely interested in her duty as part of the bureaucracy. Her lack of emotional connection allows her to act without regard for others.

Worried Workaholic. An unhealthy lifestyle has taken a toll on her. The governor has great difficulty maintaining close relationships and usually lives alone. Her health also deteriorates rapidly as she ages.

    <description>Under the cover of night, a massive ooze slides inside a manor and engulfs the occupants. When the elite guards enter the building in the morning, is has been scrubbed clean. None of the inhabitants survived the night. Gluttony is an enormous demon that devours as much as it can.

Beast Feast. This hideous creature will feast on food, livestock, and even humanoids. It continuously consumes organic matter as it moves through the world. Although it's not that intelligent, the demon is rather wise.

Fiendish Friends. Unbelievably, some evil nobles will invite Gluttony to their banquets. They make a bargain with the demon, feeding it in return for favors. If anyone complains about the presence of the hideous monster, they will be escorted out of the feast or added to the menu.

Urban Sprawl. Gluttony can lay waste to entire urban settlements. Buildings and other structures remain in place, but it consumes all living creatures.

This symbolizes the healthy balance this celestial is intent on bringing into the world. She is dressed simply and doesn't immediately stand out in a crowd. However, if someone gets close to her, they soon realize they are in the presence of a powerful being.

Peaceful Place. Although the world is a challenging place, Temperance preaches about forgiveness. She urges self-restraint and points out the good in every creature. This wise being knows that everyone and everything can play a part in the natural balance of the multiverse.

Sacred Vessels. Temperance can use her magical vessels to protect herself or any allies. Using her magic, she can send out a powerful jet of water from the containers. She can also bang the water jugs together to send out a loud, holy sound. 

Maternal Moderation. Temperance encourages everyone to moderate their appetites and desires. For her this is a simple message to be more present, as truly conscious creatures will take better care of themselves.

    <description>Glistening plates and cutlery line the long table. A few people begin to enjoy the sumptuous feast when things take an awful turn. Suddenly all the utensils and plates come to life and attack the guests. Knives and forks fly through the air like daggers and several plates smash into the bewildered crowd. Uneaten food is thrown all over the dining room. The construct has turned the tables and begins to attack the guests.

Dinner for the Sinner. This construct was created by a mage who wanted to punish those who indulge in gluttony. Some evildoers use the construct as a trap, sometimes as the centerpiece of a sinister surprise party.

Smashing Success. Once an animated feast is activated, it makes a considerable amount of noise. This construct can devastate an entire manor if left to its own devices.

Constructed Nature. An animated feast doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>Several bystanders dive out of the way as a dark coach races through the street. They look up and see the coach is pulled by a black steed and the driver is a strange-looking man. The cursed coachman then raises his whip and attacks an onlooker.

Pulling the Strings. This horrid monster was created after a tragic crash killed him and his family. He rides through the city at night, causing panic in the streets. The cursed coachman can order the nightmare that pulls the coach to follow his commands.

Caught in Trap. If a non-evil creature gets inside the coach they might never get out. The spooky-looking vehicle has trapped many individuals before. Some evildoers have used the coach to kidnap unsuspecting victims. A number of these unfortunates eventually find out they have traveled a great distance. Sometimes the victims aren't on the same plane of existence any more.

Ride Hailing. This undead creature can be commanded to drive evil-aligned creatures from one location to another. Unfortunately, this business is hurting the businesses of living coach drivers. 

Undead Nature. A cursed coachman doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>One of the most stunning sights in the city is the daydream. The spectacular, gleaming white horse inspires the populace and brings hope whenever it is seen. Its mission is to bring balance into the world by aiding the side of good.

Holy Horse. These steeds will only let good-aligned creatures ride them. They are especially fond of good wizards, good clerics, and paladins. Daydreams are sworn enemies of the fiery mounts known as nightmares.

Loyal Listener. Once the bond is formed between the daydream and its rider, it can be called when needed. This call will be heard over any distance, as long as the daydream is on the same plane of existence. It will arrive within a minute.

A Light in the Dark. They radiate a shining white light, making their presence known immediately. This means a daydream's rider won't surprise anyone.

    <description>A duck flaps its wings and then wades into a still pond. Upon closer examination this is no ordinary duck. Its feathers have the faces of playing cards imprinted on them. This is the duck of many things, one of the strangest constructs ever created. It is also the most sought after, fetching a huge price on the open market.

Curious Construct. These constructs often wander the grounds of their wealthy owners. They seek out ponds and fountains to swim in. It's as if some deep part of them wants to live the life of a real duck.

Stacked Deck. The feather cards have magical effects if they are plucked. Some of the effects are beneficial, some unusual, and some harmful. After all the duck's feather cards are removed it is destroyed in a violent explosion.

Constructed Nature. The duck of many things doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>In its darkest hour a pure heart can sometimes receive a divine visitation. Faerie godmothers are powerful fey who will aid heroes when they need it the most. They appear as older women and wear simple, yet elegant clothes. A sign that they are extraordinary is the large white owl that accompanies them. This is the fey's loyal familiar, often used to send messages.

Deep Wisdom. The faerie godmother is one of the wisest creatures in the multiverse and her powers are extensive. Faerie tales often note their kindness and generosity. Some folks say their love is unconditional and deeper than a mortal could possibly comprehend.

Good Balance. Ultimately the faerie godmother is concerned with inspiring individuals. She arrives in times of need and is deeply connected to the pulse of the multiverse. This aid has its limits though, as the ancient fey wants individuals to walk on their own path.

Fey Friend. The original home of the faerie godmother is the mysterious Feyland. She travels back and forth to this foreign land through hidden portals. These gateways include mirrors, ponds, magical gates, and hidden trees.

    <description>At times well-trained guards are needed to protect the city. Ordinary guards have their hands full against tough foes. Elite guards can offer much better protection, especially when evil humanoid tribes are on the rampage.

Pricy Protection. Many of these warriors are employed as soldiers or hired by wealthy nobles. They often protect wealthy settlements, manors, keeps, coaches, and castles. A number of elite guards are also hired as bodyguards.

Well-Trained. These guards have had extensive weapons training. Sometimes they act as officers and command groups of regular guards. They have strong constitutions and are used to being on duty for long hours.

    <description>One of the most popular individuals in the Wealthy District is the horse master. Many nobles employ the services of this equine specialist. What the nobles don't know is that this expert is also able to transform into a horse. A handsome and charming man, he gets along well with most of the inhabitants of the district.

Equine Expert. The horse master knows more about horses than anyone. All beasts are drawn to his authenticity and horses see him as part of their herd. He is able to tame any steed within a few minutes.

Secret Shape. Nobody is aware that the horse master can actually take the form of a horse. He takes full advantage of this and lives two lives. However, this individual cannot hide the fact he eats like a horse.

Home on the Range. After some time in the city, the horse master feels the need to get out into the country. Once there, he loves to turn into his beast shape and run free. As he can travel long distances as a horse, he is an experienced traveller. On his travels he has met many druids and rangers and has an extensive network of friends.

    <description>A sizeable hawk flies low over a quiet part of the city. As the sunlight reflects on its exquisite wings, it banks and heads towards a lush garden. The hawk lands in a stand of trees and suddenly changes shape into a beautiful woman in a long brown dress. Her dress matches the stunning pattern of the bird's wings.

Natural Balance. The lady hawk wants to bring harmony and balance to the city. She fights against evil and works to protect nature. She is an ally of good-aligned druids and all forms of birds. Lady hawks are often in conflict with governments who want to expand settlements into unspoiled wilderness.

Helpful Heroine. Most of these women live two separate lives. One life as a helpful, humble servant and one as a hero fighting the forces of darkness. However, a few lady hawks live quietly as generous nobles.

Picky Eater. This shapechanger eats small portions and is very particular with regards to the kind of food she eats. Many folks quickly notice that she eats like a bird.

    <description>A group of young nobles are enjoying an innocent puppet show when a blood-curdling scream cuts through the air. One of the puppets has just breathed fire on a nearby guard. As the guard burns, the crowd scatters and shouts echo in every direction. This is the work of the evil puppetmaster, one of the cruelest of the fey.

Command Performance. He controls two fiendish puppets that can wreck havoc. One puppet looks like a little devil and the other appears to be a tiny demon. However, these are no mere toys and can ruin any event. The puppets have minds of their own and will even fight each other at times.

Surprise Parties. Wealthy nobles hire the puppetmaster to perform at parties, balls, galas, and other events. They don't know that they're inviting a monster inside their homes.

Master of Misfortune. The puppetmaster has many objectives, chief of which is stealing treasure. He has also been known to assassinate individuals, for the right price. His contacts enable him to gain access to many prestigious locations.

    <description>A tall, handsome noble enters his master bedroom and closes the door. He takes off his patterned robes and strides forth. Suddenly his appearance changes and a tiger-like humanoid appears in the mirror opposite him. This is the incredibly powerful rakshasa lord.

Hidden Horror. This fiend can easily rule an entire city as a high-ranking noble, live the life of a high priest, or take on the role as an influential merchant. They could even rule a kingdom with many powerful henchmen under their command. At times other rakshasas will even serve this treacherous fiend.

Second Life. As with other rakshasas, this creature returns to Hell when it is killed. Once reborn, the rakshasa lord will seek out its killer. If the lord is killed in Hell, they are destroyed forever.

Amazing Appetites. These fiends have enormous appetites and usually hire the best cooks in the city. One clue that they might not be humanoid is the massive amount of food they eat. It is one of the main vices of this clever fiend, but not the only one.

    <description>A group of wealthy nobles sits down for a lavish dinner. The dinner guests are not aware that their host is actually a monster. He appears to be a wealthy old wizard, but in truth he is a repulsive undead creature. The rich lich lives two lives and is preoccupied with fame and fortune. They often conceal their true identity by magical means. Sometimes they will wear a mask and other vestments to hide their undead form.

Wealthy Wizard. The wealthy monster hosts parties and takes advantage of those obsessed with gluttony. This gives him an opportunity to recruit new minions or influence the political realm.

Dark Secret. These liches live in wealthy areas amongst the upper class. They are active members of their community; however, nobody knows their true identity.

Mysterious Manors. Behind the walls of the manors or castles belonging to these monsters hide numerous horrors. Undead minions and secret chambers can be found in the strange buildings.

Undead Nature. A lich doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>Everyone in the city knows the most useful messenger is this tiny fey. Windy hoppers usually deliver messages for nobles and royalty. However, anyone with enough gold can hire these flighty fey.

Air Mail. One of the reasons they are a popular choice to send messages is their flying ability. They can access many different areas in the city and avoid a lot of obstacles. Windy hoppers also have time to dance through the air with other windy hoppers on their routes.

Express Delivery. Their deliveries are quick and their success rate is quite high. Therefore, these fey have a good reputation with all the citizens of the city. However, some of the winged messengers have taken advantage of their position and sold information to nefarious individuals.

Big Appetite. Windy hoppers are known to have huge appetites. When they're really hungry, they'll even trade their services for food.

Cruel Commander. He is a horrid, monstrous being who uses violence to get what he wants. This fiend brings wrath down on anyone or anything that doesn't bend to his will.

Wave of Hate. The violent general crushes his opposition with dark magic or his lethal rod. He encourages his many followers to act without mercy. This demon only seeks power and nothing else. He doesn't negotiate and continues to expand his influence.

Dark Steed. Wrath is often seen riding on an especially large nightmare. His minions trail behind their master, and the mounted entourage is known as the Abyssal March.

    <description>Hidden in the back of a library an elderly figure studies an ancient tome. His long white beard is illuminated in the warm candlelight as a young man arrives with a question. The older of the two stands up, smoking his pipe, and then proceeds to scream at his student. Just then, a massive toad on a nearby bookshelf begins to croak. The cynical sage of old age grabs his slimy familiar and storms out of the chamber.

Wrathful Scholar. Once a renowned scholar, this man has turned to the dark side. He has lost patience with his research and students and torments the youngsters endlessly. He is filled with hate and his anger is palpable.

Misguided Mage. Originally the sage was a talented wizard. As he began to spend long hours alone doing research, he underwent a transformation. The mage slowly became a hateful, obsessive scholar.

Dark Hall. The sage lives and works in a hidden library in the Temple District. A number of students and magical constructs also make the dusty old building their home.

Controlled Chaos. Evil beings will hire these fiendish creatures for assassinations. The death wings use their flying ability to stalk their prey. They will fly high above the city tracking their target, for hours if necessary. When the time is right, they swoop in for the kill.

Wrathful Fiend. The death wing attacks with ferocity and intensity. It is a flying killing machine and acts without mercy. When it targets someone for assassination the attack is usually quick and lethal.

Shadowy Stalker. At home in the shadows, these fiends are especially active at night. A number of their assassinations have occurred under the cover of darkness.

    <description>Dracorians are a race of dragon people created by the Queen of Dragons. They are draconic humanoids that can morph into large dragons. These creatures are hateful winged monsters that want to create a world ruled by dragons. Their wings do attract a lot of attention in the city, these creatures could care less.

Two Faced. Dracorians rarely appear as dragons inside the city, instead moving about in their humanoid form. At times they will pose as gargoyles and survey the city below. In the wilderness, they transform into dragons and seek out others of their kind.

Path of Wrath. Cruel and heartless, dracorians are tremendously aggressive and take no prisoners. They will work with other evil factions, but their goal is to rule all other races.

Dragon Temple. Most dracorians inhabit a large temple complex. Its numerous dungeons house the winged monsters and their worshipping areas.

    <description>The dracorian race is made up different kinds of winged shapechangers. The dracorian mage is one of the most powerful. They command most dracorians that live in cities. These wise humanoids wield strange black staffs with the head of a dragon on top.

Winged Wizards. Armed with a number of spells, these humanoids are dangerous opponents. They will target any enemy spellcasters as soon as a battle ensues.

Maintaining Order. Marshalling the dracorians is easy as they are a disciplined race. The mages are known to lead from the front in battle, often using their shield spells.

Draconic Tome. A legendary draconic tome is guarded by these mages in the largest of their temples. This book is said to contain the sacred commandments of the Queen of Dragons herself.

    <description>In very large cities powerful evil priests lead some of the temples. These high priests of hate have tremendous influence in the sprawling settlements. They spew horrid, cruel teachings of xenophobia and other evil beliefs. Incredibly, these priests are able to travel to other planes of existence. They are even able to visit their deity on its home plane.

Unholy Hierarchy. Many other priests, clerics, and acolytes follow the high priest. Evil knights and anti-paladins are also members of the priests' temples. In some cases, these priests and their followers can rule an entire city or kingdom.

Populist Priest. Some of the poorest of the city are enthralled by these evil priests' message. A number of these outraged citizens are aligned with the misguided beliefs.

Towering Temple. The headquarters for the priests is usually a large, expansive temple. Not many creatures ever get access to this heavily guarded complex. An immense dungeon area is used to house prisoners for horrific ceremonies.

    <description>A shadow flies in front of you. Several feet away a lantern is smashed and all of a sudden, darkness falls. More shadows land and you think you glimpse a group of young men. Lost souls are a gang of undead who were created by a vampire lord. They will use violence to get what they want. These monsters live in a ruined temple on the edge of the Temple District. Because they can fly, the lost souls are able to access the remaining upper floors of this lair.

Forever Young. Lost souls have retained their youth because of the vampirism running through their veins. They loathe older humanoids and will hunt them down. Young and restless, these troublemakers are often out at night seeking a good time. Lost souls are always attempting to add new victims to their gang.

Lost Mother. A night hag has become like a mother to these wrathful undead. She travels in and out of the district, going to other planes at times. The lost souls are loyal to her and bring her new victims to toy with.

Undead Nature. A lost soul doesn't require air.

    <description>Some monks don't reach enlightenment in their training and get lost on a dark path. These martial warriors are impulsive and extremely deadly in combat. Their eyes are strangely red and they usually wear black robes. Mad monks must shave their heads in regular rituals.

Furious Faction. Although somewhat unpredict- able, they are always part of large evil factions. Mad monks serve and honor the factions' strict hierarchy. An ancient monastery in the Temple District serves as headquarters for the organization.

Controlled Chaos. Mad monks attack with a blind wrath, like wild beasts. They never retreat and will sacrifice themselves without a second thought. Seeing them in action is like watching a fire dance.

Hell Raisers. In combat the mad monk uses fiery weapons created by devils. Some of them make pilgrimages to Hell itself. This has become known as the Infernal Path.

    <description>Mystics are deeply connected to the multiverse. Many folks believe these humanoids have mastered their minds. This is incorrect, they have actually surrendered to their souls. They do have a new relationship to their minds however, simply observing their thoughts. 

Interior Life. Mystics aren't consumed by their thoughts and emotions. They stay in the moment and take whatever action they feel is required. Mystics understand that thoughts and emotions are merely passing through their consciousness.

Psionic Master. Their psionic powers include the ability to create a psychic sword with their mind. They can also send out forceful bolts of thought to target their enemies. In addition, their minds form a psionic shield around them called mind armor.

Patient Perfection. The mystic learns that their personal journey could last a long time, possibly beyond mortal constructs. They trust in something greater than themselves and continue steadily on their path.

    <description>A crowd has gathered to berate and taunt a man cornered in an alley. They scream about the hateful things he has done and throw garbage at him. These are the outraged, evil citizens who have lost all perspective.

Righteous Brothers and Sisters. The outraged believe they are in the right and nobody can question their point-of-view. These whiny, creepy creatures don't understand that the world doesn't exist to serve them.

Broken Boundaries. They are extremely immature and egocentric. These lost individuals have poor boundaries and don't take responsibility for their own actions. Lost child-like versions of their true selves, they wander through life causing more and more chaos.

Becoming the Monster. What the outraged don't realize, is that they are becoming what they hate. In many cases they behave worse than those they have targeted. In fact, they become trapped in their own inner battle unable to let go of anger.

    <description>Standing guard outside a gray stone temple are two men in long red robes. Each man wields an intimidating black halberd. They stand still as statues and are always on the lookout for intruders.

Ghoulish Guards. The nasty sentinels are trained to kill and take no prisoners. Red robes are filled with wrath and physically seethe with anger. They are highly sought after by evil priests and other evildoers to protect temples.

Savage Sentinels. Red robes are known to dispose of their opponents in gruesome fashion. Many of their victims end up being displayed outside temples.

Hate Machine. A number of red robes are in the service of the High Priest of Hate. They protect his temple and travel alongside him as personal bodyguards. Many of them will ride warhorses or nightmares.

    <description>Golden light shines down on a simple chamber as a baby is born. The pure radiant energy covers the newborn. This is the origin of the saint. A child blessed by the divine who then devotes their life for the good of others.

Heaven on Earth. These individuals are aware that the divine is in everything. Saints respect life in all its forms and find bliss in every moment. They are the closest one can get to being a celestial without being one.

Pure Patience. Saints embody patience and they are as still as water on a calm lake. Just being near them aids those of good alignment. In tune with the world, saints can hear as well as many beasts.

Divine Duty. These heroes will go out of their way to help those in need. A few saints have been known to be faithful patrons to good-aligned adventurers. They have no interest in fame or fortune and will donate all their gold to one of the many temples in the district.

    <description>Greed appears as a well-dressed aristocrat with a maniacal grin. He seems out of place in the market. A couple of black hell hounds are always at his heels. This is the first hint that Greed isn't all he seems to be. In his firm grip is an exquisite red cane. What most don't know is the cane hides a deadly sword inside.

Fanatical Fiend. This well-dressed gentleman is in fact a terrifying devil. He is a disciplined individual who heads an extensive trading empire. Hundreds of merchants work for this terrifying tyrant.

Insatiable Desire. Greed cannot help himself. He needs more and more gold, building larger and larger vaults in his dungeons. Anxious someone might steal his treasures; he is obsessed with acquiring even more. He would cheat a peasant out of their last gold piece. Most of the deals he makes aren't worth the parchment they're written on.

Dark Tower. This devil resides in the tallest tower in the city. Many evil merchants also live in this soaring structure. Numerous fiends and soldiers protect Greed in his spacious chambers at the summit.

On the Move. Most charlatans don't stay in one place for too long. They prefer to move on to a new settlement before anyone catches onto to their illegal activities.

    <description>Working deep into the night are fey known as the death scribes. They appear much like a zombie, with permanent dark shadows under their eyes. In most cases, horror is the only genre that appeals to these writers. They are prolific, but only create horrifying, toxic works.

Toxic Tongue. These fey are known for their verbal attacks against others. Their poisonous, twisted tongue always hangs from their mouth like a slobbering dog. This fey says it is respectful and genuine, but nothing could be further from the truth.

Focused on Fame. The death scribe will do anything for fame. It will steal other writers' works without a moment's hesitation. Death scribes have no conscience and will do whatever it takes to advance their career.

Corrupt Guilds. Unprincipled writing guilds desperate for cheap scribes will hire these creatures. Many of the writers in these guilds will befriend the death scribe. They are charmed by the egocentric monster and are blind to its toxic nature.

    <description>A handsome young prince is having his hair cut when he notices something. His barber has horns coming out of his head and a tail has just appeared from under long robes. The nervous noble lets the creature finish his haircut and quickly leaves the shop. This is the demon barber, a dangerous and unpredictable fiend.

Hair Raising. Locals in the Market District are impressed by the demon's skills and his shop is quite busy. A few nobles frequent the establishment and brag about their unique haircuts to all their friends. However, everyone is well aware that dealing with this fiend is very risky. The monster has a deadly razor in his clutches at all times.

Cutting Words. A customer can suffer a horrible fate if they choose to converse with this demon. It will chatter endlessly and likely give the patron an intense headache. One famous demon barber will even break out into song.

    <description>Certain individuals are gifted with great insight into the world around them. The fortune teller is one of the wisest people in the city. They have the ability to see into the future. By looking at the night sky, reading tea leaves, examining palms, staring into crystal balls, or simply being present; these people know what is to come. They have often had challenging lives and know the depths of their own souls. This has awakened a deep, pure wisdom and connection to unseen patterns in the multiverse. These exceptional souls can be found hidden away from the main market.

Ancient Wisdom. They are not on the side of good or evil. Fortune tellers see themselves simply as observers. These seers believe in balance and stay clear of moral questions. Although they won't assist evil creatures under any circumstances.

Altered States. Fortune tellers are used to entering other realities, lucid dreaming at times. Yet they spend most of their time living a very ordinary life.

Unconditional Charity. Sometimes, fortune tellers will help out those people who can't afford their services. They will assist ordinary citizens by giving them a glimpse into their future.

    <description>Leading many of the guilds in the city are some questionable characters. The most notorious of the guildmasters is the Guildmaster of Greed. He often heads influential guilds in large settlements. These include merchant guilds, fighters' guilds, mariner guilds, and many others.

Stubborn Stance. This citizen is as bold and brash as his elegant clothing. He isn't intimidated by anyone and will stubbornly go about his business. A menacing raven familiar usually sits on the guildmaster's shoulder. 

Money for Nothing. Guildmasters are obsessed with hoarding as much treasure as possible. They also want to do the least amount of work to get rich. Their henchmen are always busy doing their dirty work. Guild Members. Members of the guild are kept in line by intimidation or by magical means. Most of these individuals exploit the hierarchal structure of their organization.

    <description>An adoring crowd cheers as a long-haired young man climbs on stage. He begins to read a passage from a book and acts out the story. This is the hollow man, an artist with an ego so big it corrupts his art.

Egocentric Circle. This odd character actually believes the world does revolve around him. His circle of friends includes other egotistical men and women. They assume everyone else is also out for themselves.

False Front. Incredibly, the hollow men present themselves to the public as caring members of the community. In truth they actually see themselves as superior to ordinary citizens. They are greedy narcissists, lost in their own minds.

Fervent Following. Sometimes the lowest form of art is the most popular. This is blatantly obvious with regards to the hollow men. They have passionately loyal fans who see these egomaniacs as exceptional artists.

    <description>Eager to get rich, the master alchemist works all through the night creating new potions to sell. He will make dangerous and deadly mixtures for anyone who has enough gold. Master alchemists know that all the elements in the multiverse are related. They use this knowledge to make themselves rich.

Magical Substances. These spellcasters are always on the lookout for new substances to use in their creations. They will pay a lot of gold for these ingredients. Therefore, master alchemists are always hunting for adventuring parties to send on quests.

Mysterious Properties. At times, these alchemists deal with substances that they can't control. Massive explosions and bizarre mutations are just a couple of the results of their experiments. To help them in their work they have a creepy homunculus familiar.

Shady Shops. Hidden from the authorities, these alchemists work away in their secret shops and hideouts. Most of these menacing merchants know their businesses would be shut down if they were discovered.

    <description>This evil monster is a baker who died filled with rage. The pieman is out for revenge and nothing is going to stop it.

Killer in the Kitchen. This crazed baker spends much of its time in hot kitchens. Being an undead creature, it doesn't usually get along well with the other staff. Eventually its temper gets the better of it. This causes all sort of issues as the creature runs amok.

Baked Goods. The pieman bakes deadly blades into his pies. These lethal pies are then hurled at its victims. Afterwards, the pieman will enjoy the fruits of his labor.

Sweet Revenge. Wanting revenge on any customers, this undead monster will attack anyone enjoying themselves. It usually strikes by throwing its pies before closing in and attacking with a large iron fork.

Undead Nature. The pieman doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>Watching the market from high above are a group of strange fey. They have incredibly long arms and legs and conduct their surveillance from a lofty height. Stalker walkers are hired by merchants to watch their market stalls or stores. Greed motivates these monsters; they will do anything for gold or a delicious meal.

Sizeable Sentinels. They are very tall and can ob- serve much of what is going on in the streets. If they need to, they can suddenly reach down with their long arms and deal with pickpockets and other criminals.

View from the Top. Stalker walkers will patrol markets and crane their long necks to observe the action. The slums are often so chaotic many creatures won't even look up and notice the odd monsters.

Lost Fey. These fey were tricked into leaving Fey- land and would love to return home. They don't enjoy being ordered around and having to rely on others to survive in this strange land.

    <description>This is a heartless monster who preaches that physical desire is all important. Lust influences the Docks District in many ways. This demon holds sway over a number of individuals who wield tremendous power in this part of the city. Even some kings and queens have come under the influence of this fiend. At the same time, Lust is also on the streets tempting ordinary citizens.

Intense Wanting. The hot-tempered fiend preys on those who have lost their way. This demon tempts them to follow their most carnal desires. Once Lust uses her charms, most individuals can't resist temptation.

Symbiotic Seduction. This monster isn't interested if relationships have a healthy balance. Lust is violent and will push her agenda any way she can. She wants all creatures to follow their chaotic, primitive urges. The demon is a sworn enemy of the celestial known as Chastity.

Awful Addictions. Some of those who come into contact with Lust end up as addicts. The addictive nature of desire can destroy lives, relationships, and families. Many of these addicts end up wandering the Docks District for the rest of their lives.

    <description>Emerging from the fog is a beautiful winged woman in a white dress. She steps barefoot on the wet wooden planks of the pier. Chastity lives a lonely existence in this part of the city. Her pure presence stands in stark contrast to much of life in the Docks District.

Heartfelt Holiness. Chastity knows the challenge she faces and bravely continues her work. She also knows in her heart that she is following the right path. To her, love between two individuals brings with it a healthy maturity.

Beautiful Balance. She promotes a perfect balance of desire, reason, and willpower. Mastering passion can lead to enlightenment and finding a long-lasting relationship. Some clerics, priests, and paladins assist the celestial on her mission.

Respectful Reverence. Chastity encourages healthy relationships in which individuals honor each other by seeking a pure connection. She consistently preaches patience and respect.

    <description>A famous pirate lives in the Docks District. Many exciting tales are told throughout the kingdom about Captain Graybeard. Some folks believe his past is simply too wild to be true. However, they are sorely mistaken. This notorious pirate has led a life like none other. Although his beard hides his true age, he isn't an old man.

Heroic Past. Captain Graybeard was once a celebrated sea captain in the Royal Navy. He was a favorite of the queen and his enemies gave him their utmost respect. Nevertheless, after defeating a fleet of enemy ships, the captain fled with the bounty. His ship sailed far away and the captain began a new life as a pirate.

Successful Scoundrel. After deserting from the navy, the captain has become a legend. He and his bold pirate band plunder all manner of ships. These buccaneers are well-trained and well-equipped by their clever leader. Captain Graybeard is a fierce and cunning opponent who inspires his followers.

Band of Brothers. A number of fighters and rogues make up his rowdy band of pirates. The captain and several of his crew live in an old manor in the Docks District. A hidden tunnel allows the pirates to travel to their ship without having to be seen on the street.

    <description>A large fish-like creature moves slowly through the fish market. He is an aquarian, a race of very unusual fish-like humanoids. Four tentacles also stretch out from this large, rotund monster. Many thugs and admirers are constantly at his side. The charming Codfather controls the fish markets with his extensive network of minions. Part of the fishing fleet is also owned by him.

Might Is Right. This monster is extremely strong and uses his thick tentacles to reach out and grab any opponents. He finds many ways to intimidate those in his territory. The Codfather is a legend in this part of the city. In fact, he sees himself as the "King of the Docks." At the same time, he looks down on all other races. This strange monster sees aquarians as the superior race.

Pier Pressure. Most businesses in the Docks District know they must pay tribute to the Codfather. A few bags of gold are paid to the gangster's minions each month. His main henchman, Fishmongrel takes charge of this regular chore.

Lustful Libido. Everyone in the city knows the Codfather can't resist a pretty face. If he has an obvious weakness it is his pursuit of romantic companions. The aquarian has been seen with barmaids, bards, visiting princesses, and even mermaids.

    <description>Fishmongrel is the chief henchman of the Codfather. He is an aquarian, a race of very unusual fish-like humanoids. Unlike his master, this creature lacks any charm. This monster is a cold-blooded killer.

Horrible Henchman. Fishmongrel does all of the Codfather's dirty work. People are almost as scared of him as they are of his boss. He hunts the fish markets and piers with a long trident and net. This odd fishman also seeks out companions for his master. Fishmongrel loathes this part of his daily duties. 

Fish out of Water. This creature has never felt comfortable out of his natural environment. He doesn't like living on the land or any of the local inhabitants. Fishmongrel longs to return to the aquarian homeland.

Nautical Network. Thugs, pirates, and other nefarious characters work for Fishmongrel. They follow orders obediently and don't ask questions. Some disobedient henchmen have been known to disappear and wash up on shore a few days later.

The charmed creature regards the devil as a love interest. Although the target isn't under the devil's control, it takes the devil's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can. Each time the devil or its allies do something harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the devil dies, is on a different plane of existence from the target, or ends the effect as a bonus action. If a target's saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the devil's Devilish Charm for the next 24 hours. The devil can have no more than two humanoids and up to four beasts charmed at a time.</text>

    <description>Meeting strangers in the Docks District is always a risky business. The handsome devil is one monster that everyone should avoid. He plays the part of a charming gentleman to acquire fame and fortune. They are not that easily identifiable, even their horns are sometimes hidden under their neatly trimmed hair.

Rocky Romance. Most handsome devils are involved in a romantic entanglement with someone. These relationships are often chaotic and the devil takes full advantage of the situation. He is incredibly vain and this can cause even more drama. This devil believes he is the most handsome creature alive.

Well Connected. Not only do these devils seek fame and fortune, they are smart enough to know how to get what they want. Handsome devils will quickly build up a network of contacts in a city. Sometimes handsome devils will gain great power and reach noble status. These monsters will even start cults to gain a loyal following. They are also known to consort with succubi and incubi.

    <description>The tavern erupts in applause as a gorgeous dancer walks on the stage. Mesmerella is a popular entertainer in the Docks District. She dances gracefully and the crowd watches her every move. A red snake companion slips off the stage unseen and slithers under the tables.

Hypnotic Dance. Her performances are magical and hypnotize the crowd. Members of the audience don't usually know what's happening and their minds go blank. Soon the entire crowd is enthralled by the dancer and their guard goes down.

Men at Work. While the dancer performs, members of her gang get to work. They move through the crowd robbing people, taking what they want. A number of rogues and fighters are usually in league with Mesmerella.

Perceptive Performer. This fey is highly perceptive and not only understands the effect her physical beauty has on others, but seems to read minds. She is rather cunning and insightful.

    <description>Combatting the presence of lust in the Docks District are puritans. These people are against pleasure of any sort and follow a strict religious text. They believe they have the divine duty to enforce their beliefs on others. Puritans don't care what others think or feel, they are engaged in a cultural war.

Law above All. The puritans are obsessed with old traditional laws. To them the laws are divine and trump any other values. These people are not satisfied with the tolerance of certain practices by the authorities. Puritans only embrace intimacy within a sacred union of human male and female.

Divine Fight. Puritans feel they are in a fight of good against evil and are convinced they are on the side of good. They are not usually open to discuss alternative viewpoints. However, there are some puritans who will debate the issues.

Moral Majority. The puritans are sworn enemies of many criminal organizations and anyone who strays from the path of righteousness. Many priests and clerics are part of their movement.

VARIANT: MILITANT PURITANS. Some puritans, known as militant puritans, are lawful evil. These puritans are especially eager to spread their teachings to the peasant class. They will even promise help to feed, clothe, and house the poor. However, this assistance comes with a price. The peasants are forced to follow the divine text of the puritans.
Militant puritans will not hesitate to use violence to further their cause. These puritans also support corrupt leaders if the movement achieves its goals. They will even wage civil war to overthrow monarchies or governments.

    <description>As a handsome gentleman strides through a crowd, an older woman turns to watch him. Then she notices horns poking out from his top hat and his hooves. He calls the woman over and she soon joins him. City satyrs have magnetic personalities and lustful hearts.

Pleasure Seeker. The city satyr seeks out pleasure just as his woodland cousins do. He can often be found in inns, taverns, and even lavish galas. These fey are as curious as their cousins and want to learn about everyone and everything. They enjoy every ounce of mead and every drop of wine. Hardly an event goes by that these fey aren't a part of.

Charming Creature. City satyrs have reputations in the city and their charismatic personalities help them survive. Many inhabitants are aware that coming into contact with the fey might alter the course of their evening, or even their life. However, the satyrs still succeed in drawing many admirers into their circle.

Chaotic Nature. At heart these creatures are emotionally immature and chaos seems to follow them around. They often enjoy themselves too much and don't know how to look after themselves properly. A number of the satyrs run afoul of the law and end up in trouble with the authorities.

    <description>A tall, slender half-elf steps off an old sailing ship and looks around the docks. Sirius Moonlight has returned from his many travels. This warrior is a renowned adventurer and hero in the district. His catchphrase, "Let's get serious!" is known by all the locals. Two shining longswords hang at his hips.

The White Duke. A former duke from a faraway elf kingdom, he now lives in the city. This mysterious half-elf is also known for his grace. He is an accomplished dancer, which explains his skill with a sword.

Modern Love. This dreamy soul is a loner and completely focused on his life as an adventurer. He is a follower of the celestial Chastity and doesn't get involved in romantic relationships. The half-elf enjoys his solitude, rarely socializing with others.

Arch Enemies. Sirius is a sworn enemy of the Codfather and many other criminals in the city. He makes his home in an invisible sailing ship at the docks.

    <description>Living on the piers at the docks is a dangerous ooze from the ocean. Slither kelp slides out of the sea and hunts for food on land. It's easy for the ooze to hide on the beach, on and around piers, in the fog, or amongst foul mounds of garbage. Like other oozes, these creatures prefer the dark. They are mindless predators that seek out living organisms to feed on.

From the Deep. These bizarre creatures are from the deepest part of the sea. They will return every once in awhile to their home and move easily in the water.

Drag Back into the Ocean. The slither kelp usually drags victims back into the ocean. Once there, the kelp and other sea creatures will eat their prey. The remains of victims will wash up back in the Docks District days or weeks later.

Ooze Nature. An ooze doesn't require sleep.

    <description>One of the most challenging kind of rogues to deal with is the sprite thief. Unlike the good-aligned sprites, these fey rascals can be a handful. They are known to cause all kinds of trouble in the Docks District. Tavern owners often have to go to extraordinary lengths to get rid of these fey from their establishments. A trickster arch fey has given these fey the power to resist some magic. This boon had made these tiny creatures even more difficult to deal with.

Aggressive Fey. Sprite thieves are bold and don't shy away from conflict. However, they are quick to turn invisible and fly away if they need to. They won't think twice about bullying small and tiny creatures.

Greedy Hearts. Their twisted hearts desire gold and jewels above all else. They make hidden hideouts in the roofs of warehouses and other out-of-the-way locations.

Guild Member. Sprite thieves will often join the Thieves' Guild and have good reputations with this sort of faction. Their skills can be very useful to criminal organizations, especially when working as part of a team.

    <description>A young dark-haired woman glides through the ballroom wearing a long red dress. Many suitors are eager to meet the mysterious beauty. Little do they know; she is the temptress, the most dangerous of all femme fatales. She is only after power, fame, and fortune. This evil woman will use every trick to lure suitors. She will gladly use illusions and other magic to weave her own selfish narrative.

Sly Seduction. She often tempts individuals into serving her. The temptress is very patient and will play the long game. Sometimes she will infiltrate someone's life or inner circle for months or years. This villain has no interest any other person's welfare and will even kill to get what she wants.

Social Butterfly. This woman is always aware of the social hierarchy in the city and uses it to her advantage. Highly successful temptresses can even find themselves in the royal court if they play their cards right. Entire cities and kingdoms have fallen due to the actions of this lethal psychopath.

    <description>You see a gang of thugs gathering on an old pier. Their leader is barking at his men, inciting them to attack their rivals. This is the thug boss, a nasty piece of business. He has a rusty old hook instead of one hand and a flail in the other.

Terrible Tough. The bosses are the toughest of the thugs in the city. They use intimidation to get what they want. Newcomers to the area soon learn that the thug boss must be obeyed.

Horrible Hierarchy. Often the thug boss is part of a larger organization. It's not unusual for a gang of thugs to work underneath a thug boss, while he works for a much more powerful leader. These leaders include the Codfather, vampires, and bandit leaders.

    <description>You notice a strange shape moving in the dark. It appears two oddly-shaped humanoids are moving towards you. As you get a better look, you see that it is one hideous creature. It appears to be a short, squat man attached to a large, thin man. The shorter man's body is riddled with needles, while the taller man wields a bloody glaive.

Terrible Twins. These undead twins are a terrifying combination. The short creature can actually shoot the needles out of its body. Meanwhile the tall creature can be deadly with its glaive. The monster was created when two evil men died a gruesome death. A crazed necromancer gave them a second twisted life. At times the twins don't get along and end up in a nasty fight.

Henchmen for Hire. Twins and Needles is feared throughout the city and lives in the Docks District under the piers. From time-to-time one of the evil factions will hire this horrifying monster.

Undead Nature. It doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    While in mist form, the vampire can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water.

    <description>The legendary vampire lord is one of the most powerful denizens of the city. This evil monster can even rule an entire city or kingdom. It will often have other vampires under its command as well as an army of vampire spawn and other undead. Like other vampires, it preys on the living. However, unlike other vampires it is able to fly in vampire form. Vampire lords also have unusual mounts like nightmares, wyverns, or even evil dragons.

Double Life. The vampire lord really lives two lives, it's a charming noble during the day and a hideous monster at night. This undead monster is often part of the elite in a large city. Sometimes it is a close advisor to the king or queen. There are tales of vampire lords remaining undetected for years and years, all the time living amongst the aristocracy. The vampire lord's manor or castle is often filled with trophies from its victims. These arrogant creatures often boast about their treasures to other nobles but don't reveal how they acquired them.

Legendary Lord. Only the bravest of heroes would face this dangerous foe. It creates multiple resting places by moving dirt from its grave. Some vampire lords have survived for hundreds of years. 

Undead Nature. A vampire doesn't require air.

    <description>Wandering through the Slum District is a hateful fiend known as Envy. Cursed with a faceless form, she is addicted to acquiring new identities. Envy wishes she could live her life like the nobles. However, her destiny lies here with the downtrodden. She has attempted to leave but always ends up back in the slums.

Seething Anger. So much anger is in this demon that she radiates a sick energy. Other creatures often feel ill and unwell in her presence. Nobody feels like themselves when they're near this monster.

Sad Heart. Her heart was broken long ago and hate poured in. This demon fell in love with a celestial and her romantic advances were spurned. She wasn't brave enough to feel the hurt and has turned cold against the world.

Blind Following. Most folks don't see the anger that fills every ounce of this monster. Quite probably because Envy has a following every bit as angry and envious as she is. Her minions adore her and make excuses for her toxic nature.

Foul Mouth. The vile words that pour from her mouth are often fouler than from the crudest sailor. Hate seems to continually ooze out of this fiend into the world.

    <description>Kindness wanders the slums and attempts to ease the suffering of ordinary people. He appears as a healthy young man with long brown hair and a brown beard. Wearing simple clothes, he blends into any crowd in the district. As he travels through the slums, he radiates a gentle energy. Kindness can travel to other worlds but spends the majority of his time on the Material Plane.

Atonement. This powerful being walks the earth simply to help others. He feels deep empathy for all living things. This wise celestial knows that everyone is connected, in reality there is no separation.

Open Heart. Kindness won't think twice about providing food and drink for anyone who needs it. He'll simply magically create it and continue on his path.

Formless. The celestial can change shape into any kind of humanoid. He often does this to go unnoticed and watches how people treat him differently depending on what form he takes.

Alcoholic Adversary. Like other oozes, they are attracted by the warmth of living creatures. Therefore, they are especially fond of taverns, inns, and other places where many humanoids gather. It will attack with its pseudopods to weaken and intoxicate its victims. Finally, the ooze will ingest their bodies.

Night Life. Ale oozes are most active at night. Tavern staff often have to check under tables, on the ceilings, in the kitchen, and in storerooms to make sure they are safe.

Ooze Nature. An ale ooze doesn't require sleep.

    <description>Wizards study magic for their entire lifetime. They begin as anxious apprentices and learn from clever masters. The young wizards are wide-eyed and often get themselves in over their heads.

Clumsy Character. Apprentices are new to spellcasting and their spells are not always successful. There is a good chance that their spells will misfire and some strange arcane effect will occur. Some of these effects are mundane, others useful, and others cause mayhem.

Master and Servant. Each apprentice is under the tutelage of an older, more experienced wizard. The younger mages are usually very loyal to these magic-users and do their bidding. Some wizards take advantage of the situation and have the younger mages do endless chores. There is a famous story of a wizened spellcaster who made his novice spend hours cleaning his tower. 

Wand Envy. Apprentices are usually quite envious of experienced spellcasters. Evil apprentices might even undermine their masters.

    <description>Some warriors have a code of honor, and then there are the bandits. Leading these clans of scoundrels are bandit lords. Powerful warriors, they are skilled commanders as well.

Cruel Rule. Some bandit lords rule over slum areas, while others control a nearby wilderness area. They use intimidation to keep their clan and the local populace in line. Their bandits are not always armed with the highest quality weapons and armor, but they are fierce opponents.

Resilient Rebel. These rebellious individuals are tough and will persevere through difficult circumstances. Bandit lords are resourceful and take lessons from their many life experiences. They are often divergent thinkers and come up with interesting solutions to problems. Many of their opponents are surprised by their unorthodox tactics.

Slum Strongholds. Many bandit captains and bandits serve these bold commanders. A number of bandit lords are based in old keeps or rundown manors.

    <description>Late at night an intense brawl breaks out at a seedy tavern. Suddenly, a ghost in a dress rises up out of a nearby cask with a tray of tankards. To everyone's horror, she is also armed with darts. This is the barmaid from the shade, a chilling undead monster.

Endless Envy. She hated all her customers in life and died one night in a fight with one. Filled with hate and envy she longs for her old life.

Wicked Woman. Envious of anyone enjoying themselves, this monster is consumed by spite. She is a crazed murderer and will fight until she is destroyed. A few taverns have had to close their doors after the shade has moved in.

Last Call. She will often get into wild fights near the end of the night. Just as the tavern is closing, the barmaid will make her presence known and begin attacking customers.

Undead Nature. A barmaid from the shade doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>The darkest of faerie tales feature a horrid creature. Hiding late at night in the shadows are cradle snatchers. They kidnap children for a price, usually a high one. Cradle snatchers can move quickly and are exceptionally agile.

Hidden Horror. These fey are especially active after dark. They relish their nighttime missions, much more at home in the inky darkness than anywhere else.

Early Envy. Cradle snatchers grow up envious of happy families in Feyland. They loathe the together-ness of these families and journey to the ordinary world to wreak havoc. Back in Feyland, they know better than to attempt the same crimes. They're aware they'll be hunted down by the powerful Seelie Court.

Evil Employers. Most cradle snatchers are hired by foul creatures like witches, hags, and fiends.

    <description>An anxious man storms out of a theatre and begins to scribble frantically on a piece of parchment. This callous character can't wait to unleash his toxic quill. This is the critic, a sad and heartless intellectual. The critic rages against art, especially in the purest forms. He wishes he could write or paint like the creators he loathes.

Jaded Jealousy. He can't stand seeing others succeed where he has failed miserably. His scathing critique of artists is simply envy. The critic only dreams he could do what real creators do. His patronizing comments are the best he can come up with.

Sad Citizen. Ultimately, the critic is a fraud whose outgoing personality hides his true self. He is an unhappy person caught up in the lives of others.

Pathetic Prose. There comes a time when a critic will once again attempt to create. However, the hate in his heart always tarnishes these creations.

    <description>Lurking in the busy market is a hooded green creature. A goblin spy has snuck into the city to get information. The head of its clan wants to know about the soldiers who guard the settlement. Knowing it is in enemy territory; the goblin will make sure to keep out of the limelight.

Horrible Humanoid. This little monster is a nasty piece of business. It will do whatever it takes to accomplish its mission. Goblin spies spend lots of time in other communities and their envy has grown over time. They're eager to destroy the societies they've become so jealous of.

Deft Disguises. Most of the time these goblins will be wearing some kind of disguise. They carry a disguise kit with them all the time. Many of these spies attempt to pass themselves off as halflings or gnomes. 

Nefarious Network. Several goblins spies have contacts with gangs and the Thieves' Guild. They do favors for each other and often have similar goals.

    <description>A man's face goes red and he suddenly explodes with rage. He hurls curses in every direction and loses control. All the citizens near him back away as fast as they can. Luckily for the inhabitants of the city these hotheads are not common. Most ordinary citizens can't stand them.

Explosive Temper. Hotheads go about their day like other citizens in the city. However, their temper can easily get the better of them and trigger their rage. Turning into a even more hulking beast, the hothead can do a lot of damage. As they solve problems with violence, they will often grab an object nearby and use it as a weapon.

Confused Citizen. These men are usually in a state of bewilderment, seemingly unable to function in normal society. They don't get along well with others and constantly get into fights. They are quite egocentric and therefore live in a state of envy much of the time.

Unable to Commit. Hotheads change their minds constantly and can never commit to anything. They are extremely unreliable henchmen and chaos usually follows them wherever they go.

    <description>Jollers are young thugs who live on city streets. They are often tougher than they look and a group of them can handle themselves in a fight. Jollers enjoy cursing, fighting, drinking, and generally causing chaos.

Challenging Childhood. Many of them have had difficult childhoods. They are survivors and will do whatever they need to. Jollers are quite jealous of those who didn't struggle like they did. They especially look down on the noble class.

Stealthy Survivor. Even in turbulent times they will find a way to survive. Jollers will work for anyone, often teaming up with the Thieves' Guild or other evil factions.

Gang Life. Groups of jollers work together to look after each other. Their gangs are the closest thing they have to a family.

    <description>A tall, rough-looking man leads a ragtag group of peasants down a dirty alley. He wears a conspicuously tall hat and dresses in a bright, bold style. The man dangles a creepy-looking doll from his left hand. In his right hand is a large club. This is the Lord of the Slums, a very influential man. He is a slave lord and is delivering the unfortunates to their new owner. Slavers often operate in the Slum District and most of them work for this intimidating individual.

Explicit Exploitation. Slavers kidnap other humanoids and sell them to the highest bidder. They will enslave humans, dwarves, elves, halflings, and many other races. The slaves end up doing hard labor and have to endure awful living conditions.

Organized Crime. This lord leads a large, organized faction. Evil rogues, fighters, thugs, veterans, and even some spellcasters are a part of the organization. They often use an old manor or abandoned warehouse as their headquarters.

Inner Envy. His appearance and grandiose nature belie the inferiority complex inside him. The Lord of the Slums is very envious of the wealthy and wishes life had dealt him a different hand.

    <description>Two hulking creatures move through the crowded, dirty streets. One of the local gangs has hired them to hunt down a young man who owes them money. The crowds part quickly as people notice the horned monsters. Satyr brutes are the worst of their kind.

Famous Fey. Infamous for their brutality, these fey are nothing like their cousins. They are known for their immense strength and intimidating presence. To most citizens they appear to be a mass of muscles topped off with a menacing set of horns.

Pugilistic Presence. The satyr brutes are often hired as bodyguards by evildoers. They are very good at dealing with crowd control and can clear the streets quickly.

Feared Thug. Other fey are not fond of these bullies and most satyr brutes have been banished from

Feyland. For this reason, the brawny bullies will target fey creatures whenever they can.

At the same time, they are highly sensitive and feel an urgent need to take action because of what they know. They simply embody deep wisdom in everything they do and say.

Rebel Rebel. Knowing the truth, these individuals are often rebelling against the status quo. Those individuals taken over by ego are threatened by truth tellers. The lost souls assume everyone is as egocentric as they are.

    <description>A full moon sits above as a dark figure slips inside an elegant manor. The intruder moves through the home in the lonely moonlight. It grabs several valuable maps and quickly climbs back out of the guarded compound. Werewolf spies are sought-after throughout the kingdom. They will work for anyone and will do anything to complete their mission.

Dark Wolf. This evil spy has many talents and can handle difficult missions. Over time they often become envious of the lifestyle of the wealthy. Most of them relish the opportunity to bring any of the elite to their knees.

Moonlight Missions. Werewolf spies prefer to operate on nights with a full moon. At home in the moonlight they go about their task quickly and quietly. They usually change into their hybrid form when they need to climb a tall building.

Spy Senses. The werewolf's heightened senses help it to remain undiscovered and determine any dangers.

Sad Hag. Sloth is obsessed with sadness and is severely depressed. She struggles with this daily and blames others for her moods. Although she's not afraid of much out in the world, her inner world challenges her constantly.

Miserable Company. A number of hags and witches enjoy Sloth's company. They sit around having bizarre tea parties and complain about the surface world. This sinister coven dreams of one day taking over the kingdom above. However, there is so much apathy in the group, it's unlikely it will ever happen.

Bubbles and Troubles. A foul-smelling cauldron is always bubbling away in Sloth's underground lair. She concocts potions and poisons and other foul, odoriferous creations.

    <description>The hardest working virtue lives down in the sewers. Diligence appears as a large, muscular man with a warhammer strapped to his back. His leather belt carries a number of useful tools as well. He is always cleaning the sewers and making repairs. This celestial is constantly working to improve the lives of those who live below the city streets.

Chosen Path. Diligence has chosen his path and wants to help those in the most neglected district. He is quite humble and doesn't see himself as above anyone else. This profoundly honest celestial goes about his task humbly. His ego is non-existent, his mission is to serve others and the world around him.

Fierce Focus. The celestial is focused on his tasks and his attention doesn't sway. Whatever city he inhabits, or visits, has the cleanest underground district. Many oozes and creatures who enjoy the filth will flee when he moves into their sewers.

Underground Allies. Diligence can call on goodaligned creatures from the Sewer District for aid. Most of the non-evil inhabitants are quite fond of him. His hard work inspires everyone around him.

    <description>Deep in the sewers lies a hidden temple. Leading the secret cult based there is a loathsome character. The cult leader is a cold-blooded, vicious individual obsessed with the cult's mission. He is an authoritarian and doesn't seek out other opinions when making decisions. This individual is convinced he knows what is best for the cult.

Fanatic Focus. These cult leaders work tirelessly to further the cult's mission. They are very charismatic and convince many ordinary citizens to join their faction. Blindly loyal cultists will do anything for the leader, even give their lives.

Miserable Mission. Some of the cults worship demons or devils. Others worship strange reptilian creatures, aberrations, false gods, and other odd beings. They operate in secret, far away from normal city life.

Terrible Temple. The headquarters of the cult leader is a mazelike complex. Once sacrifices are brought in, they are rarely seen again. Many cultists, cult fanatics, spellcasters, and guards belong to the cult.

    <description>Swarms of rats race through the sewers, their tiny feet pattering madly on the rough stone. They have just been summoned by a druid. These natural spellcasters live far underneath the city. Deeply connected with nature, they are fond of this shadowy part of the world.

Dark World. Druids of the Undercity survive and even thrive in the gloomiest of districts. They enjoy this dark realm and build a home with whatever they can scavenge.

Beast Masters. Many different kinds of beasts, most notably rats, are allies of these druids. Their giant rat companion is often sent ahead to scout for them. The brave individuals can also commune with plants in the sewers.

Focused Spellcaster. Being tremendously hard workers, the druids work diligently on their craft. They get absorbed in what they're doing and have the reputation for being rather stubborn. However, some of them are able to make alliances with other underground inhabitants.

    <description>As you walk down a darkened alley, you hear scratching sounds echoing against the walls. Then you see a large beast, unlike anything you've seen before. It looks like a terrifying version of the owlbear. The fowlbear is just that, a dark version of its cousin. 

Wild One. These monsters are wild and mostly hunt at night. Most of them run amok, but there are stories of some being controlled by strange wizards. A few citizens have even sighted fowlbears in other parts of the city at night.

Arcane Enemies. For some reason, they hate spellcasters and seem to be able to smell them. They will attack spellcasters on sight if they come into contact with them.

Fey Origins. Legends say fowlbears are originally from Feyland. A number of travelers to the faraway realm report seeing them associating with evil fey from the Unseelie Court.

    <description>Living far away from prying eyes are half-giants. These creatures have learned to stay away from the everyday world. They are usually the result of large humanoids breeding with giants. Often shunned by both sides of their family, they live as outcasts.

Huge Hulk. Half-giants have to find areas they can move around in freely. Because of their size, their movement is sometimes limited by the urban environment. Over time they have found the Sewer District is the best place to live in large settlements.

Lazy Lad. They aren't the most motivated individuals and spend much of their time lying around. This has helped lower their life expectancy and they only live about 100 years. This is much less than most giants.

Small Minds. Unfortunately, half-giants are not too bright either and there are many disturbing rumors about them. Some folks say a few of the evil ones have been recruited by cults and the Thieves' Guild.

    <description>Evil creatures aren't the only denizens of the sewers, there is light in the darkness too. Fighting evil wherever they find it, are the brave and noble knight ravens. This creature is a hybrid creature combining the human form and that of a raven.

Bird Watcher. These good-aligned creatures guard the sewers day after day. They are diligent in their duty and even patrol during the night. Knight ravens are fearless and will explore the farthest reaches of the district.

Misunderstood Moods. They aren't known as the friendliest creatures and enjoy their solitude underground. True introverts, they just don't need as much time socializing with others. Knight ravens can live almost anywhere, often building nests where nobody will bother them. They love shiny objects and store them in their hidden lairs.

Bizarre Beginnings. Nobody is quite sure how knight ravens came into existence. Some surmise they might have crossed over from Feyland or another alternate world.

    <description>Stumbling through the darkness, your party attempts to make its way through the sewers. Suddenly, your movement is slowed and an odd feeling overcomes you. This is the work of Lothar the Lethargic, a bizarre sorcerer from the Thieves' Guild. He is a dangerous opponent who has many tricks up his sleeves. He used to be a member of the Wizard College and knows much about the city above. His extensive knowledge of the surface world and the many factions has been very useful to the Guild.

Slothful Sorcerer. If it was up to Lothar, he'd never leave his private chamber. But the Thieves' Guild is well organized and keep the lazy spellcaster busy. All the same, a couple of rogues have to be sent daily to wake him. Lothar provides protection for some of the high-ranking thieves and helps deal with any intruders. At times he is enlisted for missions to the city above.

Dungeon Denizen. The sorcerer lives in the dungeon complex used as headquarters by the Guild. He spends so much of his time underground that excursions to the surface world are problematic. Lothar can't see as well in the sunlight and doesn't usually venture out on the streets until after dark.

Unassuming Slacker. Although he's an idle oddball, this sorcerer has a charismatic presence. He is a popular member of the Guild and one of the Shadow's trusted henchmen. One of the reasons Lothar is wellliked is his lack of ambition, he is content with his current role in the organization.

    <description>A species of mutant humanoids lives in the shadowy world of the sewers. Quogs were created when a crazed wizard's experiment with dumgi fungi went wrong. These stupid, lazy monsters live in dark caves. They sometimes get to the surface at night to hunt for food.

Subterranean Society. Quogs usually live in large communities deep under crowded cities. The strongest of their kind rule the chaotic society. Tough quogs bully their way to the top of the pecking order.

Fungi Foragers. These unintelligent humanoids live off of the fungi that created them. If other creatures eat the fungi it will lower their intelligence (−2 for a day). This strange mushroom grows throughout the quogs' grimy lairs.

    <description>Shadows dance in torchlight as a party of adventurers explores the sewers. Then an odd creature comes into view, it has a strange pointed nose and a long tail. These heroes have wandered into the lair of the Rat King. It unsheathes a glistening longsword and turns towards the intruders.

Underworld Boss. One of the leaders in the underground world of the sewers is this strange lycanthrope. He commands a legion of wererats, many giant rats, and swarms of rats.

Lycanthrope Leader. Wererats are extremely loyal to their king and will even sacrifice themselves for him. He is incredibly lazy and prefers to have his minions do his dirty work for him. This lycanthrope leader has no trouble sending his henchmen on dangerous missions.

Big Dreams. The rat king dreams of leading a rebellion against the surface dwellers. He has other lycanthrope allies in the city who are ready to fight, namely several werewolves and werebears.

    <description>The most powerful organization in the Sewer District is the Thieves' Guild. Many citizens of the city simply refer to it as "the Guild". Numerous rogues, assassins, fighters, veterans, and even mages work for this faction. Their leader is a mysterious thief known as the Shadow. Many of the other important Thieves' Guild members don't know much about their leader.

The Guild. The members of the Thieves' Guild are extremely loyal and adhere to a strict hierarchy. At the very top of the organization is this influential rogue. He is a quiet and charismatic individual who is known to get results.

Revered Rogue. His exploits are legendary and very few would ever choose to get on his bad side. In fact, other thieves in the Guild look up to him and are inspired by his exploits.

Underground Headquarters. The Guild is usually based in a large underground dungeon with a complicated network of tunnels. Members of the faction have access to all the different districts in the city from the sewers. The Thieves' Guild also operates in other settlements in the kingdom.

    <description>Walking through the city at night you're startled by a bizarre sight. The shadow of an extremely tall rabbit is visible on a nearby wall. Moving quickly, the large creature vanishes into the foul-smelling sewers. Shadow rabbits are constantly hunting the city for their next meal.

Raging Rabbit. These creepy monsters are violent killers and are only active in the dark. Shadow rabbits will usually hunt on the surface at night and underground during the day. They stay out of the sunlight; as it weakens them a great deal.

Egg Shelled. At times, the shadow rabbit will hurl strange dark eggs. A black shadowy tail trails through the air when these bizarre weapons are thrown. The undead creatures create their eggs from shadowy necrotic matter. Shadow rabbits store piles of these eggs in secret hiding places underneath the city.

Hidden Burrow. These evil rabbits live in large hidden burrows in the sewers. A sizeable pile of treasure can usually be discovered in these lairs. Dark eggs, coins, magic items, and gemstones are just some of items that are hoarded.

Undead Nature. A shadow rabbit doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>Living far beneath the city is a disgusting creature. The sewer troll combines some aspects of a giant frog and some aspects of a slimy troll. It uses powerful arms and legs to move around the sewers. The troll surprises many creatures with its ability to leap like a frog.

Troll Tunnels. These monsters roam the endless tunnels that make up much of the Sewer District. Not the most motivated individuals, they wander aimlessly in the shadowy underground.

Sewer Swimmer. This monster spends some of its time swimming in the dirty, foul-smelling sewer water. They feed on the strange fish and odd plants in the muck and mire. If they smell one of the humanoids that lives underground, they will attempt to find some extra energy and hunt it down.

Lazy Lanky Lost. These sloth-like giants are usually very lazy and will use the least amount of effort to get the food they need. They aren't too bright and have literally been scared by their own shadows before.
