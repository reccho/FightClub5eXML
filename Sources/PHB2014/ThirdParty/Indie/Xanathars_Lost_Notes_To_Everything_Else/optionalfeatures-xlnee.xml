    <text>Sokn: Attack Augmentation

Sokn: You can activate a rune with the Sokn augmentation as a bonus action. A rune's power only affects the weapon it is inscribed on.

Ild: Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you ignite the target. While this rune is active, each creature you've burned takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of its turn for each time you've burned it, and it can then make a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all such burns on itself on a success. Alternatively, the burned creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check against your runic save DC, ending the effect of all burns on it on a success.
