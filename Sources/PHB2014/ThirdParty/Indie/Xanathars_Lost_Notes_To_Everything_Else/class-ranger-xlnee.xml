        <text>Burghal Explorers are at home in tight places, making their living as urban bounty hunters or guiding magical search crews through dangerous ruins. Dark slums and ruined cities, choked with thirsty weeds and decorated with crumbling remnants of once-thriving communities, become gathering points for desperate innocents—and for sneak-thieves and bandits who prey on the helpless.
	Burghal Explorers toe the line between the natural forest and cityscapes, moonlighting as vigilantes, or fending off unnatural horrors that reach covetously toward the darkest, deepest plots of land.

        <name>Grazing Strike (Burghal Explorer (HB))</name>
        <text>At 3rd level, you gain the ability to hinder your foes with your strikes. Whenever you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can graze your target's arm, leg, chest, or head (provided it has the body part). When you do, the creature takes an additional 1d4 damage of the weapon's type and you impose one of the follow effects on that target:

Head. It has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes before the end of its next turn.

Arm. It has disadvantage on the next Strength check or attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

Leg. Its movement speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn.

Chest. It must succeed on a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 5 feet away from you. If it hits a wall, or other permanent structure as a result of being pushed, it takes an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage.

        <text>land covered with flora and fauna that can be both beautiful and dangerous. Other lands, or other worlds, become desolate wastelands through cataclysmic occurrences either natural or manufactured. Apocalyptic events turn the land into hazardous voids more dangerous than any monster. Only the hardiest life forms survive, and even they are often mutated into hideous reflections of their natural selves.
	The Sea of Silt in Dark Sun's Athas, the Mournland of Eberron, and the spellplagued areas of Faerûn are just some examples in lore. Forged in harsh kiln of apocalyptic survival are the Wasteland Wanderer. These rangers of ruin rely on the skills and knowledge they have gathered by surviving the terrible conditions of their world—and often helping others survive as well.
