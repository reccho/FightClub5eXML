        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Predation (HB)</name>
        <text>Paladins who follow the Oath of Predation believe that the world can only be made perfect through utter control. Through careful planning, subterfuge and unwavering patience, these paladins create hierarchies with themselves at the top, and execute their power with impunity. Few paladins can resist the allure of unchecked power, and most succumb to the temptations of tyranny. The clearest example of these illriggers come from the Dragonlance campaign setting, an order known as the Knights of Takhisis.

Tennets of Predation:
The tenets of the Oath of Predation remind adherents that the whims of their patron supersede all other oaths and laws.

Cultivate the Flock. It is not enough to gather a congregation. You must hone them to a ready point, zealous to do what is necessary with a word.

Maintain Supremacy. You are the order in the midst of chaos. You vow to follow no rules other than the rigid disciplines necessary to maintain the faith. Those who deviate from the plan will die.

Reward Thy Followers. Engage not in needless cruelty and treat well those who submit. Honor thy contracts but do not hesitate to steal, murder, or mislead to complete your orders.

World of Order. You provide authority where it lacks and subjugate yourself to the cause. Just as you do not operate with impunity, you create and maintain a network of followers to precipitate an unquestionable dominion.

Oath Spells:
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

        <text>When you roll initiative, you can use your Channel Divinity to imbue your movements with foul alacrity. You add your Charisma modifier to your initiative roll, you have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in combat yet, and you deal an additional 1d6 necrotic damage to that creature. This damage increases to 2d6 at 7th level, 3d6 at 11th level, 4d6 at 15th level, and 5d6 at 19th level.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Channel Divinity: Fell Suggestion (Oath of Predation (HB))</name>
        <text>As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to magically enthrall another creature within 5 feet of you. If the target can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for 1 minute.
	You can use a bonus action to issue simple commands to the charmed creature if it is within 60 feet of you. You decide what action the creature takes and where it moves during its next turn. When you issue a command, and at the end of each of its turns, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or carry out your instructions to the best of its ability on its turn. The DM determines how the target behaves.
	Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its initial saving throw against this effect, you can't use this feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.

        <name>Perfect Domination (Oath of Predation (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 7th level, when you use your Fell Suggestion feature, you can choose to force the creature to fail its saving throw if its challenge rating is equal to or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Perfect Domination table below. When the creature makes a saving throw to break the effect, it does so with disadvantage.
	A creature subjected to your perfect domination is charmed by you for 1 hour instead of 1 minute.
	Starting at 15th level, creatures of CR 1/2 or lower are charmed by you indefinitely until the charm is broken. At 19th level, this indefinite charm extends to creatures of CR 1 or lower.

Perfect Domination:
Paladin Level | Creature's CR
7th | 1/2 or lower
11th | 1 or lower
15th | 2 or lower
19th | 3 or lower

	• You gain the effects of a greater invisibility spell.

	• Once per turn, when you have advantage on your attack roll, you deal extra necrotic damage equal to your paladin level.

	• Your allies have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature within 5 feet of you that you choose. Their attacks deal additional damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).

        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Providence (HB)</name>
        <text>Paladins who take the Oath of Providence believe they are the hand of destiny, striking down enemies beyond redemption. They believe in their hearts that some creatures, often those who commit atrocities, are fated to die in battle. These paladins are the executioners. Their oath gives them the power to bend destiny in their favor and send foes to their final fate.

Tenets of Providence:
The tenets of the Oath of Providence are written in stone on the tombs of paladins undertaking this path.

Embrace Destiny. When bad luck comes your way, understand it was meant to be and search for the opportunity fate has given you within your loss.

Deliver Enemies to Fate. Those who become your enemies aren't long for this world. They must die by your hand.

Accept Immutability. Fate is a force more powerful than the gods. Accept that there are situations in which you're powerless and take power over that you can influence.

Strength in Numbers. Together with your allies, you have the power to influence fate. Destiny smiles upon those who embrace it.

Oath Spells:
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

Oath of Providence Spells:
Paladin Level | Spells
3rd | bless, divine favour
5th | aid, augury
9th | bestow curse, clairvoyance
13th | death ward, divination

        <name>Channel Divinity: Predestination (Oath of Providence (HB))</name>
        <text>You can use your Channel Divinity to invoke the divine to smile upon your allies. When one creature within 60 feet of you that you can see makes a saving throw, you can use your reaction to grant the creature advantage on the save, using your Channel Divinity. If the effect allows the creature to take only half damage on a successful save, the creature instead takes no damage on a successful save, and only half as much damage one a failed one.

        <text>As an action, your Channel Divinity can be used to besiege your enemies with bad luck. Each unfriendly creature that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Charisma saving throw, gaining disadvantage on all saving throws for 1 minute on a failure. You must be conscious for this feature to have effect.

        <text>Starting at 15th level, your faith grants you a prophetic glimpse into the future. When you finish a short or long rest, roll a d20 and record the number rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with your prophetic roll. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can use roll in this way only once.
	When you finish a short or long rest, you lose any unused prophetic roll.

        <text>At 20th level, you become an agent of destiny, heavily influencing the outcome of the events around you. For 1 minute, you project an aura of dim, silver light in a 10- foot radius. Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in your aura, it has disadvantage on attacks and saving throws, while you and friendly creatures have advantage on attack rolls and saving throws. When the aura fades away, you regain all expended uses of your Favor the Bold feature.
