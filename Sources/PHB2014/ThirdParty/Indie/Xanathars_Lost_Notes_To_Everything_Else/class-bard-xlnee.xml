        <text>Bards of the College of Discord yearn to take the performances to the next level. While some artists feel the need to prepare or learn progressions within a harmonic framework, the extemporaneous nature of the bard's study encourages inventing variations in their musical repertoire mid performance. This practice usually bleeds into their outlook on life and, whether with accompaniment or solo, these bards are excited to delve into the unknown, no matter the vibe.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Battaglia (College of Discord (HB))</name>
        <text>Also at 3rd level, you're able to anticipate the rhythm of battle and adjust to disrupt the flow of your enemies. As a bonus action on your turn, you can choose to teleport to an unoccupied square adjacent to any number of creatures you can see within 30 feet of you. Any Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of your new location must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. At 6th level, the radius of this effect increases to 10 feet, and to 15 feet at 14th level.
	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier and regain all expended uses after you finish a short or long rest.
	As part of this bonus action, you can expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and adding the number rolled to the save DC. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll but before the DM announces if it succeeds or fails.

        <name>Encore (College of Discord (HB))</name>
        <text>At 6th level, every success fuels your performance. When you succeed on a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw in combat, you gain advantage on your next skill check, saving throw, or attack roll until the end of your next turn.
	Additionally, your attacks with your musical instruments count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Pandemonium (College of Discord (HB))</name>
        <text>At 14th level, you learn to provoke those the area around you by amplifying the clash of arms and flailing bodies, trumpeting your allies to hasten attack while sending your enemies into dysphonic chaos that is audible with 300 feet of you. As an action, you create a hyper-sonic field that reverberates out from you in a 15-foot radius for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell).
	For the duration, friendly creatures within the field experience a haste-like effect and gain a +2 bonus to AC, have advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and gain an additional action on each turn. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. A creature can only benefit from one such effect at a time. While you concentrate on this effect, your speed is 0, and you can only make melee attacks against creatures within 5 feet of you. If you have a fly speed, or are held in place my magical means, you can hover in place.
	Additionally, when a hostile creature starts its turn within the field, or moves there for the first time, it must make a Wisdom saving throw or be affected for the duration. An affected creature's speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and can't use reactions. On an affected creature's turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature's abilities or magic items, it can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.
	If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn't take effect until the creature's next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can't, the spell is wasted. If an affected creature exits the field, the effect ends for it at the start of its next turn.
	When you stop concentrating on this effect, you can't move or take actions until after your next turn, as a wave of exhaustion sweeps over you. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

        <text>Bards of the College of Keys believe that performance can manipulate anything, be it person, magic, or machine. Their preternatural charm allows these daring performers to delve into dungeons seething with traps, assured that they can use their words and song to protect themselves and allies. These bards often become spies and infiltrators, since no lock can stand up to their charms.

        <text>At 3rd level, you can coax a variety of information from a mechanism regarding its composition using merely verse and rhyme. When you spend at least 1 minute speaking or singing to a construct or inanimate mechanism, you can expend one Bardic Inspiration to learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you two of the following characteristics of the mechanism, of your choice:

	• Purpose (lock, trap, surveillance, etc.)
	• Intricacy (singular, compound, or complex)
	• Nature (magical, mundane, or otherwise),
	• Approximate difficulty class (easy, hard, nearly impossible, etc.)
	• Elemental energies present (if any)
	• Additional imbed magical qualities (if any)

When you use your action to disarm or dispel a trap, or when you make a saving throw to avoid the full effects of a trap or magical ward, you can choose to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and adding the number rolled to the ability check or saving throw.
	You can choose to use this feature after seeing the roll but before the DM determines whether the ability check or saving throw succeeds or fails.

        <name>Bard College: College of Mourning (HB)</name>
        <text>Bards of the College of Mourning specialize in easing the transition from life to death. While most bards derive their artistic catalogue from celebrating the lives of the valiant, mourning bards create a gateway for dead knights, faithful priests, and wise viziers who dedicated their lives in service, to accomplish any lingering obligations of the Material Plane.
	While some see romanticizing death as macabre, the college spent centuries observing religious rites and composing teachings of necromancy in prose to entreat the dead to remain long enough to fulfil their purpose.
	Whether woodwind or brass, string or drum, these bards are versed in delicate affairs and often find work in parades krewes, as pallbearers, or on other occasions where tact and taste are tantamount. Mourning bards improvise their melodies to mask the cries and wails of grieving loved ones, and often turn dour occasions into celebrations of remembrance. Whatever their method, their purpose is always to complement the spirits' shuffle to the afterlife in ceremonious display with arrangements of grace and style.
