    <trait>
      <name>Description</name>
      <text>You died and came back. This experience changed you and defines who you are today. The specifics of your death are up to you, but the following questions and suggestions will help you determine your odd personal history.
	How did you die? It probably wasn't of old age. Spells like raise dead can bring back those who die before old age takes them, but after dying of old age there is almost no magic which can bring a person back to life. Was it combat? An accident? A disease?
	How long were you dead? Spells like true resurrection allow a character to return from death after as many as 200 years. How has the world changed politically, technologically, and culturally since your death? What remains of your family, friends, and personal life?
	What was your life after death like? Did you spend time in the glory of eternal battle is Ysgard? Did you enjoy the paradise of Elysium? Were you tortured in the Nine Hells or Abyss? Do you remember nothing from that time?
	Maybe you didn't completely pass on, but lived life as an undead, such as a ghost or vampire. Why did you become such a being? What acts did you commit that you now regret? Who still thinks of you as a monster?
	Finally someone brought you back. Who was it, and why? Maybe it was to face an old enemy. Maybe it was a loved one who searched for a long time and sacrificed much to revive you. Maybe you were brought back for a secret only you knew. How did this person bring you back? Was it straightforward magic? What about a spell like reincarnate, which could bring your spirit back in the body of a different humanoid race? Or maybe it was some other magic that has a more sinister secret.

      <text>You can connect with the souls of the dead thanks to the long time you spent dead. You may spend a day of downtime communicating with the souls to learn a piece of information by asking a question. The quality and specifics of the information you get are up to the DM.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
      <text>You have experienced something few living people have yet to go through. You might be the type who embraces the second chance and loves life, relishing every opportunity and letting nothing stand in your way. Or you might be quiet and brooding, thinking of the revenge you seek for your death or missing the planar heaven you left behind. People who have died often live in one of these extremes, experiencing life to the fullest or becoming fixated on a single goal that gives their new life meaning.

    <trait>
      <name>Description</name>
      <text>You believe in a doctrine outlawed by your faith, taught to you in secret by other heretics. Perhaps your superiors excommunicated you from your temple, or forbidden dogma provided answers to questions you never sought. Whatever your origin, you're now shunned by the faithful, or worse, hunted.

      <name>Heretical Belief</name>
      <text>Hundreds of outlawed sects exist throughout the Forgotten Realms and other settings. Choose a belief that defines you as a heretic, or roll on the table below.

Heretical Belief:

    <trait>
      <name>Feature: Heretical Contacts</name>
      <text>You know where to find heretics in settlements where your faith is represented. If no heretics are present, you can indoctrinate weak-willed souls if you spend a day preaching. Where heretics are present, you can always find a place to hide, rest, and recuperate. If needed, they can help you escape the settlement on a cart or through a secret tunnel.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
      <text>Heretics survive by living on the run, or by blending into the ranks of greater faiths. They tend to be suspicious folk with zealous ideals and unshakable convictions. This sometimes manifests as a sense of superiority over the "unenlightened".

d8 | Personality Trait
1 | I think I'm right even when I'm wrong.
2 | I pity those who deny the heresy.
3 | I always scope out the closest exits and position myself near them.
4 | Those who refute my beliefs are damned and aren't worth saving.
5 | I'm sure my god has chosen me for a greater destiny.
6 | I'm a natural orator, but once I start talking it's difficult for me to stop.
7 | I'm always looking over my shoulder and the slightest things startle me.
8 | I believe the end of the world is nigh.

d6 | Ideal
1 | Guidance. I must teach others my forbidden doctrine. (Neutral)
2 | Caution. It's always better to be safe than sorry. (Any)
3 | Knowledge. If this conspiracy is true, what else are we being lied to about? (Neutral)
4 | Insurrection. My old faith is corrupt and must be brought down by the new order. (Chaotic)
5 | Honesty. I've been lied to enough, so now I'm sworn to always tell the truth. (Lawful)
6 | Self-Knowledge. Those who seek the truth become wise beyond their years. (Good)

d6 | Bond
1 | The heretics who educated me were burned at the stake. I won't let that happen to me.
2 | Belief in my old faith still nags at me. Have I chosen the right path?
3 | I used to be friends with the cleric who's now hunting me.
4 | I carry a heretical treatise on my person. It mustn't be found!
5 | I protect the faithless so they can know enlightenment.
6 | One of my underworld contacts reports my movements to the superiors of my old temple.

d6 | Flaw
1 | I'm suspicious of strangers, as they may be bounty hunters sent to arrest me.
2 | I sneer at those whom I deem unworthy of my time.
3 | I'm deeply superstitious, and have many rituals to avoid bad luck.
4 | I tend to misjudge the devotion of others.
5 | I'm obsessed with my studies, often to the detriment of other concerns.
6 | I'm deeply mistrustful of temple hierarchies.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>You have heroes in your family background and the story of your ancestors is known far and wide. Perhaps your parents were a famous adventuring duo, or a grandparent hunted and killed great evils. Maybe your heroic bloodline has many heroes within it going back as far as any can remember. Whatever the case, the deeds of those who came before you are great and the public's expectation of your accomplishments is even greater. The weight of your family name affects all you do.

	• Languages: One of your choice
	• Equipment: A set of traveler's clothes, a wood figure made in the likeness of an ancestor, a signet ring, a gaming set in which you are proficient, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp

    <trait>
      <name>Feature: Good Reputation</name>
      <text>Since your family name is known, you can reap many benefits by flying the flag of your heritage. People in positions of power and privilege are willing to take a meeting with you and grant you favors. The DM decides the extent and effect of these favors, but they shouldn't involve lavish gifts or great personal risk to the granter.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
      <text>You've lived a different life than those less famous than you, and probably don't know yourself as well as you should. Since birth you've been told you are special and destined for greatness, which is an idea you may be eager to prove or disprove. You're used to being under pressure and to folks talking about you both to your face and behind your back. As you start your adventuring career you have a choice to make. Most people of a heroic lineage who adventure either embrace the family name or try to get out there and make their own way. The result, however, is the same-a determined hero trying to show the world they're something more just a lucky kid with the right parents.

d8 | Personality Trait
1 | I am polite and humble to all who fawn over me.
2 | I'm sure you've heard of the great heroes of my family, but let me tell you anyway.
3 | I am quiet in public and don't enjoy being noticed.
4 | I boast about how I will put my ancestors' deeds to shame.
5 | I am attracted to people who don't fawn over me right away.
6 | I often find reasons to excuse myself from large groups of people who love me for my name.
7 | I am able to fake smile for anyone, even if I hate that person.
8 | I always ask for people to give me free stuff because I can.

d6 | Ideal
1 | Family. I intend to uphold my family name. (Lawful)
2 | Superiority. I was born better than everyone and so I deserve better than everyone. (Evil)
3 | Individuality. I am not my family's name and will make my own legend. (Chaotic)
4 | Leadership. I feel a call beyond my heritage to protect the people who look to me. (Good)
5 | Aspiration. I want to make the people who believe in me proud. (Neutral)
6 | Generosity. I was lucky to be born into this family and I will give back to those less fortunate. (Good)

d6 | Bond
1 | I wield the same weapon my ancestor used.
2 | No one knows the real me like my childhood best friend.
3 | A parent won't respect me until I make good on the family name.
4 | I would do anything to protect the town where I grew up.
5 | I have my eye on a quiet cottage to which I plan to retire.
6 | I feel like the only person who really gets me is my dog.

d6 | Flaw
1 | I can only handle so much fawning before I explode in anger.
2 | If not praised constantly, I doubt myself.
3 | If you speak ill of my ancestors, I will punch you in the face.
4 | I prefer to have someone else fix my personal problems.
5 | I put down others to boost my own confidence.
6 | If something is fashionable, I avoid it at all costs.</text>

    <proficiency>Survival</proficiency>
    <trait>
      <name>Description</name>
      <text>You were transformed into an animal or monster and lived that way for years. You most likely entered this form unwillingly but how you came down with this affliction is up to you. A caster with an axe to grind may have cast true polymorph for some petty offense committed by you or a loved one. Maybe you unwittingly donned a cursed magic item. Perhaps you activated some arcane trap when you accidentally stumbled into an ancient ruin. You could have made the choice willingly to infiltrate some group of monsters or hide as a beast from someone hunting you. You also should decide who or what changed you back to your true form.
	You were in your alternate form for years. How was living in that form different from the way you lived your life before? In what ways were you more powerful? Less powerful? Do you miss the strength of your old form or are you glad to be back in your own flesh? 

	• Skill Proficiencies: Survival and choose one additional from either Animal Handling or Deception.
	• Languages: Two of your choice
	• Equipment: A bag of caltrops, a realistic ink drawing of your polymorphed form, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch with 5 gp

      <name>Variant Feature: Body Horror</name>
      <text>This feature is meant for games using the variant madness rules in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. Before choosing this feature you must ask your DM. You have spent so much time in the form of another creature that you aren't easily shocked by bodily manipulation and mutilation. Whenever such a sight would cause you to save against a madness effect you automatically succeed.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
      <text>You have spent so much time in the skin of another form that you're not comfortable with your true body. This discomfort may manifest in a physical form like fidgeting, wearing baggy or eccentric clothing, or the need to change your appearance through tattoos or piercings. You may have more of a subconscious mental tick like targeting the appearance of others to make yourself feel better or nightmares of once again living in your polymorphed form. Your old form was a prison that hid your true self, but it was also a way to keep yourself shielded from harm.

d8 | Personality Trait
1 | I am always fidgeting because I am uncomfortable.
2 | I retained a rude physical behavior of my polymorphed form.
3 | I obsess over my appearance and wear eccentric outfits.
4 | I always judge the way others look.
5 | I am unsure of what to say when people ask about me.
6 | I often speak in my head by accident instead of aloud.
7 | I find it's easier to lie than give real personal details.
8 | I must keep touching my body to reassure myself I'm in it.

d6 | Ideal
1 | Freedom. People should be free to express who they are. (Chaotic)
2 | Power. If it gets me what I want, I'll manipulate anyone. (Evil)
3 | Security. All people deserve a place where they feel at peace. (Good)
4 | Beauty. All people should appreciate who they are. (Neutral)
5 | Authority. If you respect authority, you will be protected. (Lawful)
6 | Dog Eat Dog. To survive you must be the smartest or strongest. (Neutral)

d6 | Bond
1 | I have altered my appearance to look like my polymorphed form.
2 | Some friends I made in my polymorphed form don't know I've been turned back.
3 | I carry a piece of my old body.
4 | The place where I spent most of my time while polymorphed is home to me.
5 | I still haven't seen my family since before I was polymorphed.
6 | I still enjoy eating what I ate in my polymorphed form.

d6 | Flaw
1 | I want to be back in my polymorphed form.
2 | I sometimes believe I still possess abilities of my polymorphed form that I no longer have.
3 | All transmutation magic is terrible and must be stopped.
4 | I physically hurt myself for assurance I am in my true form.
5 | It's easier to back down from an argument than try to convince someone I'm right.
6 | The opinions of my friends are more important than my own.</text>

Little did you know something would pull you back into your old life. If you choose this background, you have some exciting questions to answer.
	You determine what your past looked like. What adventures have you already had? How much time did you spend adventuring before retirement? Who was your most-hated enemy? Who did you adventure with? Why did you hang it up?
	Something happened that made you lose your edge and finely honed adventuring skills. Has age or luxurious retirement made you soft? Did a physical or magical accident take some abilities from you? Did a supernatural force steal your mojo?
	You have decided to walk the road of adventure once again. Why? Was it because you ran out of gold and want to earn some more the only way you know how? Did you become restless in retirement and are now seeking the thrill of battle? Are you out to prove you can still live up to your legend? Are you out for vengeance? A noble quest? To tie up one final loose end you didn't realize until now was undone? Whatever the reason, you're back on the road and ready to dive into another dungeon.
