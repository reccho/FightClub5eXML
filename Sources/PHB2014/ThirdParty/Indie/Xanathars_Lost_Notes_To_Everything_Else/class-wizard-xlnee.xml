        <name>Arcane Tradition: Beguiler (HB)</name>
        <text>Those who think charm and misdirection are the trades of the bard and warlock never heard of the arcane colleges specializing in Beguiling magic. The tradition blends enchantment and illusion magic, rather than specializing in either of those schools.
	Followers of this tradition are known as beguilers and believe a brilliant mind beats a charming personality. They see magic as a way to persuade, deceive, entertain, and hide and believe fooling the mind is magic's most potent use. Beguilers are suave and adept spies, equipped to infiltrate any organization or compound without detection or with minimal casualties.

        <name>Sneak Spell (Beguiler (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 6th level, you know how to strike subtly with a spell and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal extra damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) to one creature you hit with a spell attack from a wizard cantrip if you have advantage on the attack roll.
	You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll or your target has made a saving throw against one of your enchantment or illusion spells since the beginning of your last turn.
	The amount of the extra damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to double your Intelligence modifier at 11th level, and triple your Intelligence modifier at 17th level.

	In addition, when you are concentrating on an enchantment or illusion spell that affects one creature and that creature dies or falls unconscious, you can use your reaction to target a new creature with the spell for the remainder of its duration, until you lose concentration, or become incapacitated by any means. If the spell requires the target to make saving throw, the new target attempts the saving throw before the spell's conditions take effect.

    <autolevel level="2">
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Arcane Tradition: Mage Hunter (HB)</name>
        <text>Some societies deem the practice of magical arts as sacred and too dangerous to be taught to any but a worthy few. In order to prevent the weave from being defiled by renegades some institutions regulated the use of magic in their region. Those who tracked and dealt with offending spellcasters were known as mage hunters.
	With the influx of many new creatures and magics from beyond the Material Plane, mage hunters of today have shifted their focus from regulators to preservers. They strive to hunt down and eliminate magical threats and extraplanar entities, vowing to never allow corrupt and twisted magics from ravaging their homeland.
	Mage hunters can be found in any setting. They're part of many tribal clans in Chult. They can make up some members of the Sen Sithrian in Anchôromé, the Order of High Sorcery in the Dragonlance campaign setting, or amongst the Veiled Alliance in the Dark Sun campaign setting.

	You also gain proficiency in the Perception skill if you don't already have it.

        <name>Counter-Weave (Mage Hunter (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you can hinder the effectiveness of a creature's magical prowess when you identify them as a magical threat.
	You can use a bonus action to place the counter-weave on a creature you can see within 30 feet of you, which lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if the creature dies, you die, or you are incapacitated.
	Until the counter-weave ends, the following conditions apply:

	• You gain a bonus to saving throws against spells cast by a creature affected by counter-weave equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).

	• You double your ability score modifier to Wisdom (Survival) skill checks to track your quarry, as well as Intelligence checks to identify or recall information about your target.

	• The range of your target's cantrips and spells is reduced by 10 feet or to the range of touch, whichever is greater.

	• Your target's Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on a spell is reduced by your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).

You can use this feature twice, after which you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

        <text>At 6th level, you can forge a magical bond with a weapon you have chosen to combat renegade spellcasters and otherworldly beasts. Choose a melee weapon in which you are proficient. Performing the bonding ritual takes 1 hour, which may be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual.
	You can't be disarmed of your bonded weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand. If you attempt to bond to another weapon, you must break the bond with the first.
	While your bond exists, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon. The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn't already. At 10th level, your effectiveness with the weapon improves as it gains a bonus of +1 to attack and damage rolls, and then again to a +2 bonus at 14th level.

        <text>At 10th level, you learn the magic circle spell. You always have it prepared and it doesn't count toward your total number of prepared spells for the day.
	You can use an action to cast magic circle instantly and at a range of self without expending a spell slot. Additionally, when you hit a creature affected by counter-weave, you can instead use your bonus action to cast the spell in the same manner, centered on your target.
	Once you cast magic circle using this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest, though you can still cast it normally using an available spell slot.

        <text>You focus your study on manipulating magic in a way that turns the destructive power of arcane evocation into rejuvenating magic. For others, this gift manifests from faith, a pledge to a patron, or a deity's behest. Many arcane colleges have unlocked these regenerative powers from tireless hours poring over holy texts and alchemical manuals. While most wizards find outlets as talented enchanters, military artillery, or ward-makers, the students of this school could apply their versatility to any employment in nearly every setting, even that of an adventurer.

	Additionally, you learn two cantrips and add one 1st level spell to your spellbook from the cleric spell list. These spells are wizard spells for you, but other wizards can't copy cleric spells from your spellbook into their own spellbooks.

When you cast an evocation spell of 1st level or higher that targets only one creature with an instantaneous duration that doesn't require concentration, the target creature takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to half of the total.
	If the spell requires you to make an attack roll or requires a creature to make a saving throw, the creature can choose to be hit or fail the saving throw. The spell doesn't impose any status conditions.
	Undead and constructs can't regain hit points in this way.

The creature regains hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier at the start of its turn, provided it has at least 1 hit point remaining.
	Additionally, while a creature is regenerates in this way, it's immune to disease and poison. If the creature is currently diseased or poisoned, any effects are suspended for the duration of its regeneration.

When you cast an evocation spells that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell's level to impose an effect that uses your wizard's spell save DC. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws and take no damage from the spell. They also regain hit points equal to half the damage the spell would have dealt.
	Undead and constructs can't regain hit points in this way.

        <text>Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 5th level or lower that restores hit points, you can maximize the healing power of that spell.
	The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 1d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after the healing effect occurs. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.
	Additionally, you choose four spells from the cleric spell list to add to your spellbook, one from each of the following levels: 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th. These spells are wizard spells for you, but other wizards can't copy cleric spells from your spellbook into their own spellbooks.
