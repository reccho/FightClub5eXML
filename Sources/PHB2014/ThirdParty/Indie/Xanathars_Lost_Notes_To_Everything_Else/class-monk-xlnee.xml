        <name>Monastic Tradition: Way of Atonement (HB)</name>
        <text>Monks of the Way of Atonement seek absolve themselves for their past transgressions, sins, and current indiscretions by giving up their possessions and atoning through peaceful and selfless service. Seeking not the zealot's path, they believe that through calming and controlling their fervor, they can bolster the universal well-being of all mortal creatures. These monks seek to protect delicate balance struck by the presence of the pantheons. and strike out in malice only to defend those who can't defend themselves.
	Feared by those with wealth, and praised by those who lack it, these monks are easy to spot in their dusty burlap robes and bare feet. The Atoned sacrifice, not only in material possessions but, flesh to find their way to forgiveness and often carve or brand the markings of the gods on their skin in homage.
	In exchange for the strength to seek perfect purity in an existence full of ambition and hubris, followers of this path endeavor to abstain from anger, envy, and corruption. Not so naïve as to believe that the gods' designs won't require skirting the edges of temptation, and sometimes justify ends by their means, they willingly pay the price in flesh for their actions. As part of their atonement, they learn to encourage wicked and vile denizens of their world to repent using only a heavy, unadorned club that each refers to as their penance.
	To take this path, the acolyte must commit to the poorest lifestyle, renouncing all that they were before atonement.

        <name>Path of Atonement (Way of Atonement (HB))</name>
        <text>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your Hit Dice represent a pool of vitality you can exhaust to fuel your Way of Atonement features.
	Atonement requires absolutely commitment, and constant reminder of the pain you inflict on others by inflicting that pain on yourself during deep contemplation or prayer. To atone, roll the Hit Dice you spent and add them together. You deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage to yourself equal to the total. You deal this damage after you regain hit points from any Hit Dice you spend at the end of a short or long rest, and it can't be reduced in anyway.

Penance Weapon. Also at 3rd level, you learn a ritual prayer that creates a divine bond between you and one unadorned, nonmagical simple weapon of your choice. You perform these prayers over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. During this ritual, you carve notches that represent your past transgressions, and each time you atone, you are compelled to consider any additional sins you have committed and add notches to its stock to atone. While your penance is paid, your weapon is bonded to you, counts as a monk weapon for you, and you can't be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated.

Strength of Faith. You can deliver your own form of justice to others. When you hit with your penance weapon, or an unarmed attack, you can spend one Hit Die and expend one ki point, to add 2d8 force damage to the attack.

Trials of Temptation. For each permanent magic item you currently own, the cost of Hit Dice and ki points used by your Way of Atonement features increases by 1, and again each time you acquire an additional permanent magic item. The increased cost remains until you no longer possess any permanent magic items.

        <name>Monastic Tradition: Way of Empathy (HB)</name>
        <text>Monks of the Way of Empathy follow the tradition instilled with compassion for all living beings. While their training includes martial practice as a form of self-discipline, their teachings also focus on a healing art of rare form, known as Empathy. Using these techniques, they learn to manipulate the ki to transfer malady and pain from another to themselves. Some members of this tradition dedicate themselves to the sick and the poor, while others find their calling side by side with soldiers, rehabilitating the fallen in battle. Their scars might telltale of thousands of warriors, without ever feeling the cold of steel against their own flesh.
