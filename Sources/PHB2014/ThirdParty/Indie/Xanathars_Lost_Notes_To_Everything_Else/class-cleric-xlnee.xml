        <text>Heretics preach of a void at the center of the universe that dying gods created to devour the Weave. The necrotic energy it emits is called "Entropy": a potent force that clerics can harness to shield themselves from magic and annihilate arcane casters. The chained god Tharizdun claims this domain, while in Chessenta, a giant sphere of annihilation is worshipped as an aspect of Entropy itself. Cultists who wield the power go by many names: thaumatoclasts, entropomancers, or entropists.

Domain Spells:
At each indicated cleric level, add the listed spells to your spells prepared. They do not count towards your limit.

Entropy Domain Spells:
Cleric Level | Spells
1st | detect magic, inflict wounds
3rd | gentle repose, spiritual weapon
5th | dispel magic, protection from energy
7th | blight, death ward
9th | circle of power, hallow

        <name>Channel Divinity: Arcane Disruption (Entropy Domain (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to disrupt the flow of magic in your vicinity. As an action, you conjure an aura of disruptive energy that radiates from you in a 15-foot radius.
	The aura lasts until the end of your next turn, and moves with you, centered on you. While inside the aura, any creature that attempts to cast a spell must first succeed on a Constitution saving throw. If they fail the save, their spell fails to cast and the spell slot is wasted.

        <name>Channel Divinity: Entropic Retaliation (Entropy Domain (HB))</name>
        <text>At 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to drain a caster's magical power. When you succeed on a saving throw against a spell or successfully disrupt a spell using Arcane Disruption, you can use your reaction to force the caster to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the caster loses an additional spell slot of the same level. If they possess no more slots of that level, they instead gain a level of exhaustion.

    <!-- Divine Domain: Survival Domain (HB) -->
    <autolevel level="1">
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Divine Domain: Survival Domain (HB)</name>
        <text>Clerics and shamans of primitive tribes living in harsh environments have no greater mission than ensuring the survival of their tribes. The gods of survival often have other domains in similar realms, such as life or nature. The worshippers who work within the Survival domain, however, are much more primal and brutal than their counterparts.
	The gods of primitive and uncivilized races are most likely to hold this domain: lizardfolk god Semuanya and orc goddess Luthic are prime examples of deities whose clerics embrace the Survival domain. They are more likely to remain in their territories, nurturing and protecting their flocks, but fighting fiercely when a threat invades their lairs.

Domain Spells:
At each indicated cleric level, add the listed spells to your spells prepared. They do not count towards your limit.

Survival Domain Spells:
Cleric Level | Spells
1st | create or destroy water, false life
3rd | locate animals or plants, prayer of healing
5th | fear, protection from energy
7th | death ward, dominate beast
9th | antilife shell, greater restoration

	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long or short rest.

	Each allied creature that can see you gains advantage on their next melee or ranged weapon attack before the start of your next turn. If their attack hits, the allied creature also regains hit points equal to your cleric level.
