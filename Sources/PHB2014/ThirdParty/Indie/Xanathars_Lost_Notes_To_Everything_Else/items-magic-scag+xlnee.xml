This armor swirls with a multiverse of intoxicating colors. While wearing it, any critical hit against you awakens the armor, you roll a d20 to create a random effect. Each time you roll, the new effect replaces any previous effect. Unless otherwise stated, the armor returns to its normal state when you finish a short or long rest.

4 | For the next minute, you regain 5 hit points at the start of each of your turns.
5 | If you die from this attack, you immediately come back to life as if by the reincarnate spell.
