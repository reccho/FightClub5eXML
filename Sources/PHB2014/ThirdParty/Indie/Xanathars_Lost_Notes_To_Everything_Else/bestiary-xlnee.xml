    <description>When forests are cleared to make lumber or to make room for new cities, their fey inhabitants usually return to the Feywild. Some, however, remain to ensure nature survives in even the most civilized of places.

The elder dryads refuse to let the land perish beneath stone and structure. These stubborn defenders of nature bind fey spirits to weeds creating urban dryads that grow in the cracks between buildings and cobblestone.

Shy and secretive, they are nocturnal creatures who travel amongst the shadows and the interstices no one notices. At night they move with an uncanny speed through their neighborhoods, tending to their kindred flora before dawn. By day they hide and rest, blending in with the city as weeds or ivy cascading down the sides of buildings. Over time they've evolved as a part of the city, and fight to protect its natural spaces just as they fought to protect their forests in ancient times.

Urban Dryads:
Urban dryads are indifferent to citizens of the city. They obey the elder dryads' orders to preserve what nature remains within the city, and create urban sproutlings to help them in their fight.

Urban dryads live in city parks and on the sides of overgrown buildings using their long ivy manes to remain unseen.

Urban Sproutlings:
Urban sproutlings report to and serve the urban dryads. They travel in bunches of six, secretly transporting goods or messages to locals and other dryads by leaving the items in designated places.

Sproutlings are bound to a specific neighborhood, and burrow into cracks in the cobblestones to remain hidden.

Elder Dryads:
Elder dryads negotiate with the most powerful factions of a city to insure their cooperation toward the best interests of the dryads. Some nobles even pass laws protecting natural spaces in hopes of gaining access to the city-spanning network of urban dryads as a way to transport goods or information. In most matters, the elder dryad remains neutral but is more often swayed to protect the natural order of things.

The elder dryad isn't bound to any neighborhood, and can move freely within its city but can't leave the city itself.

    <description>Gens are tiny genie-kin that reside in the elemental planes and, due to their stature, are sometimes referred to as lesser genie. Once bound, they are very willing servants who strive to be the best at any task they are given. They even tend to be competitive with other gen.

At their core, every genie holds itself in high regard, and the gen desire the same praise and respect as their far more powerful counterparts. Recruiting one is an entirely different matter, as most deal exclusively with other genies and extraplanar beings. Yet, it is possible for a diligent mortal to gain one's trust and obedience, and their patience is greatly rewarded in both friendship and power.

Plane Shifters:
Gens possess the ability to shift between the planes, making them ideal messengers. A warlock who has made a pact within such a being can expect to communicate with powerful creatures through their familiar, and even request their aid, but such exercise is taxing on the gen and they require time to recuperate after each planar shift.

To Serve with Purpose:
While the majority of gen find their toil within the realms and palaces of noble genies and in the company of unfathomable cosmic power, to a mortal, they can prove to be diligent attendants, able teachers, and friends. Such gen take pride in their association to the warlock as much as, or more than, the warlock might. Should their warlock miss the first opportunity to introduce their gen, it will likely take the next instant upon itself.

As they serve with distinction, a gen's self-worth won't accept any physical or mental abuse at the hands of any master, nor do they see themselves as a pawn or slave.

While they pride themselves on being helpful, each gen wishes to elevate their status through their time spent with other powerful beings, learning how each approaches a specific situation or magical opportunity. In fact, each gen believes that their power grows faster the more they accomplish with a single entity, and thus the greater each ascension may be.

With this in mind, some gen cultivate multiple pacts with powerful beings throughout their existence, but limit themselves to only one mortal at a time. All things important to the gen hinge on this relationship, as each hopes that someday they may grow to know absolute power and prestige, rivaling the gods, as only a true noble genie can.

Elemental Nature:
The type of gen your pact binds depends on its elemental plane of its origin. The majority are classified into four types, whose personalities can differ as much as their appearance.

Air Gen:
Known as djinnlings, air gen are slim and muscular with long white or gray hair and skintones ranging from pale to dark blue. They are haughty but friendly unless threatened, and take great pride flaunting their social skills.

Variant: Gen Familiar:
Gens bound to a warlock by a noble genie patron often act as advisors and familiars. They often push the warlock into gaining more power and influence, as to be deemed worthy of service. Such gens have the following trait.

Familiar. The gen can serve as a familiar, forming a telepathic bond with its willing master. While the two are bonded, the master can sense what the gen senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the gen is within 10 feet of its master, the master shares the gen's Magic Resistance trait. At any time, the gen can end its service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond.

    <description>Gens are tiny genie-kin that reside in the elemental planes and, due to their stature, are sometimes referred to as lesser genie. Once bound, they are very willing servants who strive to be the best at any task they are given. They even tend to be competitive with other gen.

At their core, every genie holds itself in high regard, and the gen desire the same praise and respect as their far more powerful counterparts. Recruiting one is an entirely different matter, as most deal exclusively with other genies and extraplanar beings. Yet, it is possible for a diligent mortal to gain one's trust and obedience, and their patience is greatly rewarded in both friendship and power.

Plane Shifters:
Gens possess the ability to shift between the planes, making them ideal messengers. A warlock who has made a pact within such a being can expect to communicate with powerful creatures through their familiar, and even request their aid, but such exercise is taxing on the gen and they require time to recuperate after each planar shift.

To Serve with Purpose:
While the majority of gen find their toil within the realms and palaces of noble genies and in the company of unfathomable cosmic power, to a mortal, they can prove to be diligent attendants, able teachers, and friends. Such gen take pride in their association to the warlock as much as, or more than, the warlock might. Should their warlock miss the first opportunity to introduce their gen, it will likely take the next instant upon itself.

As they serve with distinction, a gen's self-worth won't accept any physical or mental abuse at the hands of any master, nor do they see themselves as a pawn or slave.

While they pride themselves on being helpful, each gen wishes to elevate their status through their time spent with other powerful beings, learning how each approaches a specific situation or magical opportunity. In fact, each gen believes that their power grows faster the more they accomplish with a single entity, and thus the greater each ascension may be.

With this in mind, some gen cultivate multiple pacts with powerful beings throughout their existence, but limit themselves to only one mortal at a time. All things important to the gen hinge on this relationship, as each hopes that someday they may grow to know absolute power and prestige, rivaling the gods, as only a true noble genie can.

Elemental Nature:
The type of gen your pact binds depends on its elemental plane of its origin. The majority are classified into four types, whose personalities can differ as much as their appearance.

Fire Gen:
Efreetikin have a bulky, muscular physique with skintones ranging from deep red to violet. They are quicktempered, and their skills in deception can be a boon, or a detriment, to their masters.

Variant: Gen Familiar:
Gens bound to a warlock by a noble genie patron often act as advisors and familiars. They often push the warlock into gaining more power and influence, as to be deemed worthy of service. Such gens have the following trait.

Familiar. The gen can serve as a familiar, forming a telepathic bond with its willing master. While the two are bonded, the master can sense what the gen senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the gen is within 10 feet of its master, the master shares the gen's Magic Resistance trait. At any time, the gen can end its service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond.

Water Gen:
