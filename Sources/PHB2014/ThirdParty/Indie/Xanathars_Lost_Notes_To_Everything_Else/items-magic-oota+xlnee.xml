    <text>On a hit with this weapon, the wielder can forgo dealing damage and attempt to trip the target, in which case the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall prone. The DC is 8 + the wielder's Strength modifier + the wielder's proficiency bonus.

When you roll a 1 or a 20 on a d20, roll another d20 to create a random effect. Each time you roll, the new effect replaces any previous effect. Unless otherwise stated, the weapon returns to its normal state when you finish a short or long rest.

This crossbow is fitted with a cartridge that can hold up to six crossbow bolts. It automatically reloads after firing until the cartridge runs out of ammunition. Reloading the cartridge takes an action.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Proficiency: simple, light repeating crossbow

    <text>Ammo: crossbow bolt

This crossbow is fitted with a cartridge that can hold up to six crossbow bolts. It automatically reloads after firing until the cartridge runs out of ammunition. Reloading the cartridge takes an action.

Made from the wood of yew trees charred by lighting, this heavy crossbow is studded with hearts carved of rose zircon. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the crossbow. Before shooting the crossbow you may turn a nonmagical bolt loaded in the weapon into a healing bolt as no action. If you don't use the bolt within an hour after converting it, it reverts back into a normal bolt. When struck with a healing bolt the target takes damage as normal and then heals a number of hit points equal to 4d10 + 4. You can't shoot another healing bolt from the crossbow until you complete a short or long rest.
