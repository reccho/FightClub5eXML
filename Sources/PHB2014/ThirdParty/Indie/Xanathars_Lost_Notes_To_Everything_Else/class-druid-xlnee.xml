        <text>Druids of the Circle of Seasons learn early in their trials that all things are transient. All things that live must die, and those things that don't live are worn away by the wind and rain.
	As a druid of the seasons, you embody nature's invisible hand. Whether through famine or pestilence, flood or fire, you revere the world's natural cycle of destruction and rebirth. Your connection to the natural cycles of life and death allows you to burn nature's enemies and renew your allies.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Shroud of Seasons (Circle of Seasons (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape to embrace friend or foe under nature's shroud. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you that has at least 1 hit point. That creature must make a Constitution saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes.
	If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following options, which takes effect at the start of the creature's next turn and lasts 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). For the duration, you can use your bonus action to cause nature to focus directly on the creature to greater effect.

Deep Winter's Freeze. Frost covers the target's skin. Its movement speed is reduced by 10 feet. Using your bonus action, it takes cold damage equal to 1d4 + your Wisdom modifier.

Fade Rot. A creature is afflicted with pestilence and disease, causing it to suffer one level of exhaustion, and regains only half the normal healing from spells and effects. Using your bonus action, it takes necrotic damage equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 damage).

Harvestide. The season of harvest reaps the bounty and readies the land for renewal. A creature under the shroud can use its bonus action on its turn to be showered in radiant energy, and regains hit points equal to 1d4 + your Wisdom modifier.

Wildflame. As a bonus action, you cause flames to flash across the target dealing 1d6 fire damage, and causes the target to ignite in flames. At the start of each of its turns, or until the shroud ends, the target takes fire damage equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1) and sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. If the target or a creature within 5 feet of it uses an action to put out the flames, or if some other effect douses the flames (such as being submerged in water).

        <text>At 6th level, when the target creature of your shroud dies, you can use your reaction to reclaim some of its life force and instantly use it heal yourself or another creature within 60 feet of you a number of hit points equal to your druid level.

        <text>At 10th level, your Shroud of Seasons feature grows to stalk your target and each creature that you can see within 5 feet of it. Each creature that starts its turn under the shroud, or moves there for the first time, must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be affected by its current season.
	Additionally, while you concentrate on your shroud, you gain resistance to the damage type of the season in effect.

        <text>Starting at 14th level, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape to cause your shroud to affect all creatures within 15 feet of your target. Additionally, the damage and healing caused by your shroud is doubled.
	While you concentrate on your shroud, you can cast a concentration spell at the same time. The first time you would fail a saving throw to maintain concentration, the spell fails and the shroud remains.

    <autolevel level="2">
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Druid Circle: Circle of the Spiritlords (HB)</name>
        <text>Ages ago, nature priests with a greater connection to the spirit realm believed the world itself to be formed from a group of elemental and primordial spirits, each specifically charged to harness one of the major elements of creation. This band of tribal druids developed a set of ritual practices that allowed them to summon these spirits, whose essence now resides in every rock, tree, and breath of air, controlling the ebb and flow of nature not only in their homeland, but in all lands beyond. This order of priests were known as spiritlords.
	Spiritlords begin their journey with the rites handed down by those before them, specifically, the ritual to create a special mask from an ironwood tree. This mask allows the spiritlord to play host to the spirit-elementals roaming this world.
	As the spiritlord grows in power and gains a heightened level of attunement to the spirit world, their mask transforms along with them, being altered with new carvings, ritual paints, and brands that symbolize the bond between the druid and the spirits they carry within.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Spirit Bond (Circle of the Spiritlords (HB))</name>
        <text>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you choose one spirit-element to bond with your mask from the Spirit Bond table, and you learn the cantrip associated with your spirit-element's fledging conduit, which counts as a druid cantrip for you, and doesn't count against your number of cantrips known. You can select one additional spirit-element at 6th level and again at 10th level.
	Additionally, you can cast the find familiar spell, which bears features similar to your chosen spirit-element (glowing skin, fiery eyes, a thorny tail, etc.). Once you cast find familiar using this feature, you can't cast it again until you finish a long rest.
	You can only have one mask at a time and once this bond is formed, you can't change the spirit-element within your mask. If the mask is lost or destroyed, creating a new mask for your spirit-element takes 8 hours of uninterrupted time, which you can accomplish during a long rest.

Spirit Bond:
Spirit Type | Fledgling Conduit | Empowered Conduit | Damage Type
Earth | mold earth | magic stone | Poison
Fire | control flame | create bonfire | Fire
Water | shape water | frostbite | Cold
Wind | gust | thunderclap | Lightning
Light | dancing lights | sacred flame | Radiant
Shadow | minor illusion | chill touch | Necrotic

        <name>Empowered Conduit (Circle of the Spiritlords (HB))</name>
        <text>At 6th level, your mask channels the destructive powers of your spirit element. You gain the cantrip in the Empowered Conduit column on the Spirit Bond table.
	Further, when your connection with the spirit realm strengthens enough to host an additional spirit-element, you can switch between them with an action. When you do, you gain the benefits of the mask's current bond and your familiar can take on a similar appearance. No matter how many spirits inhabit your mask, you can only ever call on the aid of one at a time.

	Additionally, your spells ignore resistance, but not immunity, to your mask's current damage type.
