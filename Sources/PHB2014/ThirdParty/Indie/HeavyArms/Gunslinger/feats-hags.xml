    <prerequisite>Proficiency with at least one firearm</prerequisite>
    <text>You are adept at using firearms in close quarters, gaining the following benefits:

	• Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.

	• Once per turn, when you hit a creature within 10 feet of you with a ranged attack using a firearm, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier). On a failed save, you push the target 5 feet away from you and knock it prone.

    <name>Marksman (HB)</name>
    <text>You are an expert at hitting your mark with ranged weapons, gaining the following benefits:

	• Being prone doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attacks.

	• Attacking a prone target doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls if the target is within your weapon's normal range.

	• If you haven't moved since the start of your turn, you can use a bonus action to steady your aim. Until the end of your next turn, you have advantage on the next ranged weapon attack roll you make. This effect ends early if you move or take damage.

    <prerequisite>Proficiency with pistols</prerequisite>
    <text>Your speed and skill with a six-gun is unmatched. You gain the following benefits:

	• When you take the Attack action and attack with a one-handed weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a pistol you are holding in your other hand.

	• If you are surprised at the beginning of combat and
aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you attack with a pistol before doing anything else on that turn.
