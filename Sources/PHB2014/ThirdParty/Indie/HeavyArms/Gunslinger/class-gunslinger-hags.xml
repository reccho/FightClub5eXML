      <name>Gunslinger</name>
      <text>"Never run a bluff with a six-gun."
—Bat Masterson

An old saloon, scored with bullets and stained with blood, stands before a lone gunslinger. "Ike Williams, I've come for you!" she yells, cutting through the revelry within. As silence descends, she waits, the wind grasping at her scarf and spitting dust across her path. A hulking man pushes through the doors. "Heh," he sneers, fingering a gun at his hip. "And what's a little—" he begins, moving to draw, but she is faster, her fists full of roaring thunder.

In the hostelry's basement, an old man heaves himself from a copper bathtub, steam clinging to his scarred body. "Evil comes," he whispers in a cracked voice. The exclamations of his bathing companions are cut short by the sound of heavy, dragging footfalls overhead. The man mutters a brief prayer as he recovers his gun belt from a loose pile of clothes.

A mercenary gauges his final opponent through a haze of smoke. She returns his appraising stare from over her cards. She waits, biting on her cigar before throwing in a stack of chips, but her nervous chewing betrays the bluff. The man returns her smile. "All in."

With an aim as sharp as their wit, gunslingers pursue their own ends for their own reasons, beholden to no code except their own, and trusting no judgment save that learned through experience. The wild frontier breeds hard folk to hard ways, a dangerous land where life can hinge on a deal of the cards or the speed of the draw.

      <name>Welcome to the Frontier</name>
      <text>Beyond the edge of civilization, where the law struggles to gain purchase and dangers lurk around every corner, the unknown calls to the desperate exile and the fortune seeker alike.

Gunslingers are not artificers, inventors, tinkerers, or engineers—they are pragmatists who use the best tools available to them. In most settings where you encounter a gunslinger, those tools are firearms. However, in realms without firearms, gunslingers are deadly arbalists or specialists with some other ranged weapon.1 What sets these characters apart are their focus and grit. They want to win. They need to win. Everything in them calls for them to do whatever it takes to survive in a hostile environment. Civilization doesn't suit them.

Before you build you gunslinger character, work with your GM to determine the level of technology in your setting. If the setting contains firearms, consider whether they are a new innovation or an established means of conducting warfare? Are the underlying technologies a closely held secret of a particular society or organization? Was the discovery through experimentation or through claiming relics of a lost or alien civilization? They might be the creation of forward-thinking dwarven engineers, turning their cultural heritage of steelwork and stonecunning toward new opportunities, or perhaps they're an idea dreamed up by early gnomish settlers, now made safe to use.</text>

      <name>Creating a Gunslinger</name>
      <text>When building a gunslinger, consider how you came to live by the gun. Was it for justice? Fame? To protect someone or something you hold dear? And what drives you now? The reassuring clink of coin in your pocket? The righteous satisfaction of vanquishing evil? Maybe past transgressions weigh heavy on your heart, driving you to find redemption? Or do you seek revenge? Who is the character behind the gun?

Quick Build:
You can make a gunslinger quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. Second, choose the criminal or folk hero background.</text>

        <name>Multiclass Gunslinger</name>
        <text>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player's Handbook, here's what you need to know if you choose gunslinger as one of your classes.

Ability Score Minimum:
As a multiclass character, you must have at least 1 of the following ability score(s) to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a gunslinger.

	• Dexterity 13
	• Wisdom 13

Proficiencies Gained:
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of your new class's starting proficiencies, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a gunslinger.

	• Armor: light armor
	• Weapons: simple weapons, firearms
	• Tools: none

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Multiclass Features</name>
        <text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does).
	Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared:
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.
	Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
	If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots:
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
	If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.
	For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic:
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

        <text>In combat, you find your flow with deadly efficiency. Whenever you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, the lowest number you must roll on the d20 to score a critical hit with subsequent ranged weapon attacks decreases by one. You can gain this benefit multiple times, but it can't reduce the threshold for scoring a critical hit below 16.
	You lose this benefit if you miss with an attack, you become incapacitated, or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a creature since your last turn.
	From 14th level, whenever you gain this benefit, you can gain it one additional time, but it still can't reduce the threshold for scoring a critical hit below 16.

        <text>The hard-fought battles of your past have instilled in you a wellspring of resolve, which is represented by grit points. You have a number of grit points equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 point).
	You can spend these points to fuel various grit features. You start knowing four such features: Buck Up, Bullet Time, Covering Fire, and Dodge Roll. You learn more grit features as you gain levels in this class.
	When you spend a grit point, it is unavailable until you regain it. You regain 1 expended grit point whenever you score a critical hit against a hostile creature, and you regain all expended grit points when you finish a short or long rest.

Buck Up:
You can spend 1 grit point as a bonus action to spend one or more Hit Dice, following the normal rules for regaining hit points using Hit Dice. The maximum number of Hit Dice you can spend each time you use this feature equals your proficiency bonus.

Bullet Time:
When a creature you can see makes a ranged attack against you, you can spend 1 grit point to impose disadvantage on the attack roll.

Covering Fire:
While you are holding a firearm, when a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack against a creature other than you, you can spend 1 grit point as a reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll.

Dodge Roll:
You can spend 1 grit point as a bonus action to move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity att

While charmed in this way, the target is friendly to you and acts under your control while you are riding it. A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 24 hours, after which time it can be affected again. A creature you are fighting automatically succeeds on the saving throw.
	Your gunslinger level determines the range of beasts you can charm in this way, as shown in the Mounts table. At 3rd level, for example, you can attempt to charm any Beast that has a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed:

Motivations:
d4 | Motivation
1 | You're following in the footsteps of a guardian or mentor.

The revelator is the shield of the innocent and the sword of the just, seeking to uphold the law and punish the wicked.
