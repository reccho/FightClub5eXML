      <name>Creating a Ranger</name>
      <text>As you create your ranger character, consider your journey through life, and how that path lead to accumulating the skills you now have. Did you grow up with a mentor, learning the ways of the ranger from a young age, or did you find your own path? What motivated you, and does it still motivate you now? Perhaps you took up arms to protect something you hold dear, or maybe you trained to exact revenge? What keeps you hungry for adventure?

Quick Build:
You can make a ranger quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. Second, choose the outlander background.

        <name>Multiclass Ranger</name>
        <text>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player's Handbook, here's what you need to know if you choose ranger as one of your classes.

Ability Score Minimum:
As a multiclass character, you must have at least the following ability score(s) to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a ranger (HeavyArms).

	• Dexterity 13
	• Wisdom 13

Proficiencies Gained:
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of your new class's starting proficiencies, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a ranger.

	• Armor: light armor, medium armor, shields
	• Weapons: simple weapons, martial weapons
	• Tools: none
	• Skills: Survival

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Multiclass Features</name>
        <text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does).
	Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared:
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.
	Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
	If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots:
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
	If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.
	For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic:
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

        <name>Bushcraft</name>
        <text>You can adapt quickly to your environment, mastering the skills you need to prevail in any situation. You gain two bushcraft skills, choosing from the list of bushcraft skills from the "Ranger (HeavyArms): Bushcraft" spell list. You gain an additional skill of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Bushcraft Skills column of the Ranger table.
	Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one bushcraft skill you know with a different one that you could learn at that level.

You must meet all the prerequisites a bushcraft skill has in order to learn that skill. If you lose a skill's prerequisite, you don't gain the benefits of that skill until you meet the prerequisite once more.
	You can only learn a skill once, unless the skill suggests otherwise. Each time you learn such a skill, you must choose a different option for that skill.

        <name>Favored Enemy</name>
        <text>You have significant experience hunting and tracking certain types of creature. Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two humanoid races (such as elves and orcs) as favored enemies.
	You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them. Furthermore, you always know when you are in the lair of a favored enemy.
	Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of your chosen favored enemy types with another type you have encountered on your adventures.

        <name>Focus</name>
        <text>In combat, your keen senses allow you to strike at the right moment. This awareness is represented by focus. At the start of each of your turns in combat, you gain 1 focus point. You can't gain focus points when you're incapacitated.
You can spend focus points on various focus features. You start knowing four such features: Blade Dance, Lightning Reflexes, Rapid Fire, and Swift Action. You learn more focus features as you gain levels in this class. The maximum number of focus points you can spend on a turn equals your proficiency bonus.
	You lose all your focus points at the end of the combat, if you are knocked unconscious, or if you die.
	Some of your focus features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

	Focus save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Blade Dance:
When you hit a creature with a melee attack on your turn using a light weapon, you can spend focus points to deal an extra 1d6 damage to the target for each point spent. This damage increases by 1d6 if the target is a favored enemy. If you are two-weapon fighting, you can add this extra damage to the second attack if it hits the same target.

Lightning Reflexes:
When you are forced to make a Dexterity saving throw, you can spend 1 focus point to make it with advantage.

Rapid Fire:
When you take the Attack action and attack with a ranged or thrown weapon, you can spend 2 focus points to make an additional ranged weapon attack as part of that action. This cost becomes 1 focus point if the new attack targets a favored enemy.

Swift Action:
You can spend 1 focus point to Dash, Disengage, Hide, Search, or Use an Object as a bonus action.
