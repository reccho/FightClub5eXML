This adamantine blade was once wielded by Siguror, who used it to slay the dragon Fáfnir. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you take the Attack action and attack with this weapon, you can make one additional attack with it as part of the same action.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Proficiency: martial, greatsword
