    <level>0</level>
    <classes>Ranger (HeavyArms): Bushcraft</classes>
    <text>Prerequisite: 1st-level ranger (HeavyArms)

You can summon a Beast with a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower from the surrounding area to serve as your animal companion. The summoning ritual takes 1 hour, and can be performed during a short or long rest. The creature accompanies you until you dismiss it, you no longer meet the prerequisites to summon it, you use this feature to summon a different creature, or you die. The following rules apply to your animal companion:

Actions: Your companion is friendly to you and obeys your commands. It loses its Multiattack action, if it has one. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but it only takes evasive actions, unless it is forced to defend itself. If you are incapacitated, your companion can take any action of its choice, though it focuses on protecting you and itself. If the creature has an appropriate anatomy to serve as a mount, it acts under your control while you are riding it.

Game Statistics: Your companion's statistics are altered while it travels with you. It uses your proficiency bonus instead of its own, and adds your proficiency bonus to the AC in its stat block, to a maximum AC of 18. The creature is also considered proficient in all saving throws. Finally, your companion doesn't have Hit Die. Instead, its hit point maximum is calculated as follows:

	Companion hit point maximum = (5 + its Constitution modifier) x your ranger level

Resting: At the end of a short rest, your companion regains hit points up to half its hit point maximum. At the end of a long rest, it regains all its lost hit points.

Dropping to 0 Hit Points: If your companion is reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, it falls unconscious and makes death saving throws, just like a player character.

You can spend 1 focus point as a bonus action to command your companion to you take one of the actions in its stat block. If you command it to attack, it can make another attack as a bonus action, provided both attacks target the same creature and the target is one of your favored enemies. In addition, your companion gains the following benefits:

	• Your companion gains a bonus to its damage rolls equal to your proficiency bonus.

	• The initial saving throw DC of your companion's features that force a target to make a saving throw equals 10 + your proficiency bonus if this total is higher than the DC shown in the creature's stat block.

    <text>Prerequisite: Survived a mutagenic augmentation process

(This skill can be chosen multiple times)

Over the course of a long rest, you can create one mutagenic decoction of your choice. If you have taken this skill more than once, you can instead create a number of mutagenic decoctions of your choice up to the number of times you have taken this skill. Creating decoctions requires access to a set of alchemist's supplies and an empty flask for each one you create. A decoction lasts until it is drunk or until the end of your next long rest, after which time it spoils and is wasted.
	A creature can drink one of your mutagenic decoctions as an action. The benefits granted by a decoction last until the drinker finishes a short or long rest, unless the decoction's description explicitly says otherwise. Only creatures with the Mutagencraft skill can withstand the harmful side effects of mutagenic decoctions; if a creature without the Mutagencraft skill drinks one of your decoctions, it gains 1 level of exhaustion and becomes poisoned until the decoction's effects end (the decoction's effects end early if the condition is removed).
