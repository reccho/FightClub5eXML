        <text>Blood archers are cursed beings that should not exist. Birthed from nightmarish experiments by the Obitus Scholare, these hunters use a cursed method of archery, weaving their own blood into attacks to produce supernatural effects. Their powers come from tarblood, an amalgamation of hundreds of species' blood that was forcefully injected in the veins of hunters. Those who didn't die or go insane during the procedure became the first blood archers; only they and their descendants can wield this vicious power.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Blood Shot (Blood Archer (HB))</name>
        <text>At 3rd level, you learn to unleash special magical effects with some of your shots. When you gain this feature, you learn three Blood Shot options of your choice (see "Fighter (Blood Archer (HB)): Blood Shot Options" spell list).
	Once per turn when you fire an arrow from a shortbow or longbow as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Blood Shot options to that arrow. You decide to use the option when the arrow hits, unless the option doesn't involve an attack roll. You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
	You gain an additional Blood Shot option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each option also improves when you become an 18th-level fighter.

Some of the Blood Shot options require your target to make a saving throw; the DC is calculated as follows:

	Blood Shot save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

	In addition, once you've fought a creature, you can relentlessly track it, sensing the blood of your prey. You have advantage on any Perception or Survival check you make to find a creature you've dealt damage to and has blood.

        <text>At 7th level, you gain the ability to create arrows with your blood. When you make a ranged attack using a shortbow or longbow, you can create a blood arrow in place of standard ammunition. Blood arrows are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
	In addition, when you use your Blood Shot feature, you can add your Constitution modifier to the damage roll of the effect.

        <name>Martial Archetype: Living Nightmare (HB)</name>
        <text>First it was an accident, a hunter dying on a battlefield, in dire need of a transplant. The clerics used what they could find and unknowingly grafted accursed flesh onto the dying man, yet, not only did he survive, he rose again stronger than ever before.
	It was that day the Radiant Church knew that they found a power rivalling that of the very god they worshipped. They took these experiments further, ordering the Obitus Scholare to harness that power. The desperate fight against the scourge demanded urgent results; no act was too sacred nor debauched. And so, the accursed Luyarnha gave birth to living nightmares, monsters of its own creation.
	The experiments have since stopped: indeed, it was far too common to see those grafted with eldritch flesh lose their humanity and turn into the very monsters they were supposed to eradicate. Yet some remain, a few fortunate hunters who retain their sanity, or perhaps, who have yet to awaken their true powers.

        <name>Awakened Mutation (Living Nightmare (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, the powers within your eldritch flesh begin to awaken. You forever lose proficiency with shields and heavy armor, as your ever-changing body cannot hold on to them.
	Your flesh hardens and your reflexes grow, empowered by other-wordly ichor. While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 11 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Eldritch Weaponry (Living Nightmare (HB))</name>
        <text>Also at 3rd level, as a bonus action, you can mutate your body, transforming it into various weapons of destruction. They count as simple melee weapons for you, and you add your Strength modifier to the attack and damage rolls when you attack with them, as normal. When you use these weapons, you drop any items you are holding with those limbs. Some of the Living Nightmare features require your target to make a saving throw; the DC is calculated as follows:

	Living Nightmare save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

You choose the weapon's form each time you make an attack roll:

Stinger. One of your limbs grows into a razor-sharp blade. It deals 1d8 piercing damage on a hit. When you take the Attack action to attack with it on your turn, you can use a bonus action to turn another limb into a Stinger and strike with it, making a single additional attack.

Hammer Arm. Your arms turn into a black-tinted bone club. On a hit, it deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage and you can choose to push the target 5 feet away.

Tendinous Lash. One of your limbs replaces its bones with tough coiled ligaments, allowing it to stretch a disturbing distance without breaking. It deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit and has a reach of 15 feet. In addition, the first time on a turn you deal damage with your lash, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your Living Nightmare save DC or be knocked prone as the limb sweeps their feet.

Alternatively, you can transform your limb into a shield:

Sinister Aegis. Whenever you are targeted by an attack that you can see, you can use your reaction to temporarily turn one of your arms into a fleshy shield, gaining a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.
	In addition, your eldritch flesh is capable of devouring some magical items to gain their properties. As part of a short or long rest, you can devour the following types of magic items, absorbing their properties:

	• A rapier; its properties are added to your Stinger.
	• A maul; its properties are added to your Hammer Arm.
	• A whip; its properties are added to your Tendinous Lash.
	• A shield; its properties are added to your Sinister Aegis.

If you absorb another magical item of the same type, the previous magic item of that type is destroyed.

        <name>Macabre Appetite (Living Nightmare (HB))</name>
        <text>At 7th level, you can use the voracious hunger that dwells within your accursed body to devour the corpses of your foes and mend your flesh. When you stand within 5 feet of the corpse of a creature that has died less than 1 week ago, you can use your action to touch it and let your eldritch appendages devour it. You regain a number of hit points equal to the creature's CR (minimum of 0, rounded down). In addition, for the next 24 hours, you can use an action to assume the creature's appearance and voice, though none of your game statistics change. You stay in the new form until you use an action to revert to your true form or until you die.
	After 24 hours, or if you consume another creature, you lose the ability to take the appearance of the consumed being.

        <name>Ascended Being (Living Nightmare (HB))</name>
        <text>At 10th level, your eldritch powers give you access to powers mortals can only dream of. Whenever you consume a creature with your Macabre Appetite, you also inherit all their memories from the last week before their death.
	In addition, as a bonus action, you can grow a pair of eldritch wings, giving yourself a flying speed of 30 feet for 1 minute. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

GM Note: If you want to make this subclass more sinister, limit the use of this feature to once per short or long rest, or until the player devours a humanoid of CR 1 or higher.

        <text>At 15th level, your body enters its next stage of evolution. The weapons you wield now have the power to annihilate all who stand in your way. Once on each of your turns when you make use of your Eldritch Weaponry, you can strain your body to generate a more violent eldritch power, replacing one of your attacks:

Stinger. You can replace one of your Stinger attacks. Instead I, each creature in a 30-foot cone in front of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Living Nightmare save DC or take damage equal to 3 hits from your Stinger.

Hammer Arm. You can replace one of your Hammer Arm attacks. Instead, you smash the ground below you, causing quakes and sending fragments flying. Each creature within 20 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Living Nightmare save DC or take damage equal to 2 hits from your Hammer Arm and be knocked prone.

Tendinous Lash. You can replace one of your Tendinous Lash attacks, swiping those around you instead. Each creature within 15 feet of you must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your Living Nightmare save DC or take damage equal to 1 hit from your Lash, be pulled 10 feet in a straight line towards you, and be restrained until the start of your next turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1), and can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

A creature can use its action to make an Athletics check against your Blood Shot save DC, removing the tendrils from itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Otherwise, the tendrils last for 1 minute or until you use this option again.

The arrow flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary, and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon's range and there is a path large enough for the arrow to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow plus an extra 1d6 piercing damage, and you learn the target's current location.
