        <text>You subjugate your foes to the crushing woe of hopelessness. You can cast the bane spell at 2nd level without expanding a spell slot. If the targets are in direct moonlight, they have disadvantage on the saving throw.

Lunar Alignment. Creatures in direct moonlight now automatically fail the saving throw, and creatures under the effect of the spell take psychic damage equal to your level in this class at the start of each of their turns. If a creature remains under the effect of the spell for its entire duration, they fall unconscious. The condition ends if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.

        <name>Ranger Archetype: Lunar Warden (HB)</name>
        <text>Lunar Wardens hold a deep fascination for the enigmatic powers of the moons, forming a profound bond with the ever-changing celestial bodies, drawing upon their forms to enhance their abilities. This ancient elven tradition has persisted through the ages, renewing its knowledge with each new moon that manifested itself. These wardens of old learned to harness these new lunar powers, consolidating their wisdom and passing it down through generations. Today, this conclave of stout defenders has become exceedingly rare, with only a sparse few members residing within the city-state's walls. While some whisper that members of this conclave can cleanse the moons of their corruption, the turmoil within Luyarnha suggests otherwise.
	By embracing the lunar energies, these rangers undergo a transformation that melds their very essence with that of the moons, adopting aspects of their celestial beauty and might. As their bond with the moons deepens, Lunar Wardens attune themselves to the celestial bodies' forms, allowing them to channel lunar energies in extraordinary ways-mending grievous wounds using the power of a blood moon or burning asunder their foes with the blazing intensity of a scorching moon. When in perfect harmony with the eldritch body looming above, their abilities swell to incredible heights, transforming them into exceptional nocturnal hunters, whereas others would instead seek refuge from the dreadful moons.

        <text>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to harness the energy of the moon. You learn the light cantrip and have advantage on saving throws against direct effects caused by Eldritch Moons (e.g., you would have advantage on the saving throw caused by staring directly at the Vacuous Moon, but if a monster has enhanced abilities due to an Eldritch Moon, you wouldn't gain advantage on saving throws you make against those abilities).
	Additionally, you gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.

	You learn all the following Moon Conduits. You can use Conduits a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier and regain all expended uses after you finish a long rest. Starting at 7th level, you regain all expended uses after you finish a short or long rest.

Lunar Alignment. If you use a Moon Conduit that belongs to the moon currently looming over the world, your abilities become more powerful, detailed in the Lunar Alignment section of each Conduit.

If your unarmed strikes already deal 1d4 or 1d6 damage before the transformation, the damage die becomes a d8.

Lunar Alignment. You unleash your lunar bloodlust. You have advantage on an attack roll with your claws against a creature if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated, and the damage die becomes a d12.

Lunar Alignment. When this Conduit gives a creature advantage on a saving throw, they can reroll one of the dice once. Alternatively, you can use this reaction to instead cast counterspell at 5th level, though it automatically fails against spells of 6th level or higher. Wisdom is your spellcasting modifier for this spell.

Lunar Alignment. Creatures automatically fail their saving throw against this Conduit, and the fire damage they take becomes dos instead of d4s and ignores resistance to fire damage.

	In addition, each time you use a Moon Conduit, a shard of the lunar energy remains within your body for 1 minute or until you expend it or use another Moon Conduit. You can expend this energy to gain advantage on one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw (no action required).

While charmed, they are incapacitated and are compelled to move towards the lure with their movement each turn, only ending their movement when in the light.

An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Creatures standing in darkness have disadvantage on this saving throw. You must concentrate on this effect as you would concentrate on a spell.

Lunar Alignment. You can harness more of the tar and can choose up to six creatures. While covered in tar, creatures are instead affected by the slow spell. You do not need to concentrate on this effect.

On a failed save, it regards another creature of your choice that you can see within 90 feet of you as its mortal enemy until the start of your next turn. It must use its actions to attempt to kill its mortal enemy, disregarding all other creatures. Creatures that are immune to the charmed condition are immune to this ability.

Lunar Alignment. The duration of this Conduit extends to 1 minute. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the effect early. The effect also ends early if the target's quarry dies.

    <autolevel level="3">
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Ranger Archetype: Torturer Enclave (HB)</name>
        <text>Enshrouded within the radiance of Luyarnha, a conclave of rangers lies concealed, their solemn duty vowed to the preservation of peace within the walls, regardless of the means. Ever vigilant against the insidious advance of the scourge, they have honed their inquisitorial craft, recognizing the importance of early prevention of this plague, achieved by finding and interrogating victims, and even potential victims, before signs of sickness manifest themselves.
	Although these rangers have been known to serve the clergy and royalty, since the fall of the House of Commons, they are no longer beholden to the fickle desires of any specific lord or lady. Many are now driven by a loftier purpose, one that necessitates the utmost discipline and commitment, for they recognize that if the Scourge is allowed to propagate, it shall wreak havoc upon all they cherish. Yet, some pursue baser ambitions, offering their expertise to those who desire to bend these rangers to their malevolent will, extracting confessions or inflicting retribution upon adversaries. After all, torture, a practice as ancient as the very bedrock of the earth, is a dreadful instrument, potent enough to shatter even the most indomitable of spirits.
	In the throes of battle, these rangers bring their torturous expertise with them, employing it with merciless precision to break their enemies, methodically subjecting them to unspeakable agony. They do not recoil from these savage tactics, for they understand that failure means death or a fate grimmer still. They show no mercy to their foes, for they are well aware that none would be extended to them in kind.

Disclaimer: Please be advised that while some may use torture as a plot device or as a means of gathering information, it is a sensitive and disturbing topic. While the use of torture can be integral to the story being told, which is why it is included in this book, it is important to ensure that everyone at the table comes to an agreement regarding its use prior to the session beginning, and if it's included, whether descriptions should fade to black or be more detailed.

        <text>Starting at 3rd level, you've learned to interrogate and use implements of torture. You gain proficiency with torture tools and Insight checks, and your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses them.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Torturer Techniques (Torturer Enclave (HB))</name>
        <text>Also at 3rd level, you learn to use techniques. Unlike others who require patience and careful preparation, you employ techniques that are fueled by your magic, letting you make use of torture tools even in the midst of hunts. You can use each technique twice and regain the ability to do so again when you finish a long rest, or when you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to reuse it.

Techniques. When you make a melee weapon attack against a creature while you have torture tools in one hand (or a free hand and the presence of torture tools at your disposal, such as strapped around your leg), as part of that attack, you can use a technique to enhance it in some way. You must use the technique before the attack roll is made, and regardless of the outcome, the use or the spell slot is expended. You can only use a technique once per turn, though you can use multiple different techniques in the same turn, and you can only use one technique per attack.

Empowered Techniques. At certain levels in this class, you gain the ability to empower your torturer techniques using magic. When you expend a spell slot to use a technique, you inflict extra damage, and the target suffers a penalty to saving throws it makes against the technique, as shown on the following table. You can't empower a technique using a spell slot of a level you haven't unlocked, even if you have higher level spell slots (e.g., through multiclassing or items).
	Additionally, the first two times you use a technique after you finish a long rest, you can expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher, in which case the technique is empowered as if you had expended a spell slot one level higher (up to a maximum of the highest spell slot you've unlocked).

Saving Throws. Some of your techniques require your target to make a saving throw to resist the technique's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

	Technique save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Torturer Techniques:
Ranger Level | Spell Slot Unlocked | Extra Damage | Saving Throw Penalty
3 | 1st | Wisdom mod | -1d4
5 | 2nd | 2 x Wisdom mod | -2d4
9 | 3rd | 3 x Wisdom mod | -3d4
13 | 4th | 4 x Wisdom mod | 4d4
17 | 5th | 5 x Wisdom mod | -5d4

On a failure, you tear away so much flesh that its body starts to bleed deeply. It takes 1d8 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns (this damage can't be reduced or ignored in any way) for 1 minute.

    <text>This satchel contains various small implements that can bludgeon, cut, and pierce in ways designed to maximize pain. Meant to extract the truth, many use these tools with far more nefarious intentions. Proficiency with these tools grants the following benefits:

Exhaustion: Using these tools for 1 hour on a restrained creature causes them to gain 1 level of exhaustion, after which you must make a Dexterity (torture tools) check. The DC is equal to 20 - the creature's Constitution modifier. On a failure, the creature takes 10 points of your choice of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage.

Intimidation: When you make an Intimidation check against a creature whom you used these tools against, you gain a bonus equal to your proficiency bonus + twice the level of exhaustion the creature has.
