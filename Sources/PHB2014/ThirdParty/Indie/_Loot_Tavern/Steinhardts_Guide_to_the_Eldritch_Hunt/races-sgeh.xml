      <name>Description</name>
      <text>The city of Luyarnha has never experienced the threat of devils, as if fiends fear coming near the city walls. This absence extends to those of infernal descent;
tieflings born in the gothic city are severed from their devilish origins, their blood becoming tied to something far more sinister.
	Called "accursed" due to their monstrous appearance, they are feared by most, and their powers envied by nearly as many, letting their jealousy morph into hatred;
an accursed existence indeed. These tieflings possess a fraction of the power of their dark mother's boundless reproduction and are incapable of creating life, though they can create figments of it, with the most powerful capable of creating ephemeral copies of themselves to fight in battle. These tieflings never stay in the city for long, vanishing shortly after reaching adulthood.

      <name>Appearance</name>
      <text>Accursed tieflings vastly differ from their brethren. Instead of a pair of horns, they have dozens protruding from their skull, akin to a never-ending cancerous growth. Their monstrous shape is furthered by the eye-like protrusions that cover the horns, although they are nothing more than bony sprouts waiting to burgeon. Their skin is thick, covered in bestial fur, and their muscular limbs are grossly misshaped; the human half of their heritage has nearly all but vanished.</text>

      <text>The cursed-blood are so named for their accursed lineage, forever bound by the twisted tethers of their very own blood. From the moment of their birth, they are each adorned with a quiescent mask, sealing their features in a permanent expression of cold, unfeeling marble. Nevertheless, these fated beings find strength in the familial bonds that tie them together, for they must rely on each other to survive the foul scourge that has befallen Luyarnha.
	Alas, the cursed-blood are shunned and abhorred throughout the city-state, only finding refuge far from the prying eyes of society, amidst the squalor of the city's slums. In these desolate corners, where madness and scourge ravage the populace, the cursed-blood stand vigilant, ever protective of their own kin, finding solace in their shared bane.
	The cursed-bloods' origins are viewed as a taboo subject not to be spoken of by the populace, to avoid incurring the wrath of those above. According to whispered rumors, the curse was a punishment meted out by vengeful Great Ones, a retribution for sins committed by their forebears. Once, their kin—demons, dragons, and other creatures of flame and brimstone—roamed freely across the world, but they have long since disappeared, banished from existence by the enigmatic beings that lurk in the glacial void beyond. Now, all who share even a drop of their blood are condemned to a wretched existence, their individual origins erased and replaced by the familial bond they forged from the crucible of their affliction.
	This curse, wrought from birth, is both tragic and horrific. Each born as conjoined twins, one of them must inevitably perish for the other to live. Although the death of their twin happens in the womb, the cursed-blood can still hear and feel the echoes of their lost sibling's voice within their own soul. This unspeakable atrocity against life twists their flesh and soul, and forces them to carry the remnants of their other half within their chest in the form of a gaping maw, an eye, or some other feature over which they have no control.

Although all cursed-bloods view each other as family, depending on their origin—draconic, infernal, or otherwise—their flesh has evolved in various ways.

      <name>Conjoined Twin</name>
      <text>Your dead twin manifests on your body in one of the following ways of your choice:

	• Chest Maw. The mouth on your abdomen can devour many things, temporarily storing them in a pocket dimension within you. It can hold up to 250 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 32 cubic feet. If you fall unconscious or die, you harmlessly regurgitate all materials in your maw. Breathing creatures inside your maw can survive up to 1 minute, after which time they begin to suffocate. After 24 hours inside your body, a nonmagical item is destroyed, consumed by your body. If it is a magic item, a creature, or a corpse, you regurgitate it instead. Starting at 5th level, you can store materials indefinitely (but still not while unconscious or dead), and the dimension's volume and weight it can hold doubles.

	• Heedful Eye. As long as the eye in your chest is open, you have darkvision out to 120 feet. You can cast detect magic once while the eye is open, regaining the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest. Starting at 5th level, you can cast see invisibility once while the eye is open, regaining the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. You can open the eye as a bonus action, and close it at will (no action required).

	• Gaping Remain. Ripped out of your chest, due to your will or perhaps your twin's, it now only exists within you in spirit, capable of influencing the world through you.

	• You can speak telepathically to any creature you can see, provided the creature is within a number of feet of you equal to five times your level. The voice the creature hears isn't yours, but that of your twin. The telepathic speech is made in a language you know, and the creature understands you only if it knows that language. Starting at 5th level, the creature is able to telepathically respond to you in a language it knows.

	• You learn the mage hand cantrip. You can cast it without any somatic or verbal components, and the hand has the appearance of your twin's. Your spellcasting ability for the spell is Charisma.</text>

As a mirage cursed-blood, your infernal legacy is apparent.

Some say that in another life mirage cursed-blood were tieflings-beings seldom seen in Luyarnha today.

It can hold up to 250 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 32 cubic feet. If you fall unconscious or die, you harmlessly regurgitate all materials in your maw. Breathing creatures inside your maw can survive up to 1 minute, after which time they begin to suffocate. After 24 hours inside your body, a nonmagical item is destroyed, consumed by your body. If it is a magic item, a creature, or a corpse, you regurgitate it instead. Starting at 5th level, you can store materials indefinitely (but still not while unconscious or dead), and the dimension's volume and weight it can hold doubles.

	• Heedful Eye. As long as the eye in your chest is open, you have darkvision out to 120 feet. You can cast detect magic once while the eye is open, regaining the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest. Starting at 5th level, you can cast see invisibility once while the eye is open, regaining the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. You can open the eye as a bonus action, and close it at will (no action required).

	• Gaping Remain. Ripped out of your chest, due to your will or perhaps your twin's, it now only exists within you in spirit, capable of influencing the world through you.

	• You can speak telepathically to any creature you can see, provided the creature is within a number of feet of you equal to five times your level. The voice the creature hears isn't yours, but that of your twin. The telepathic speech is made in a language you know, and the creature understands you only if it knows that language. Starting at 5th level, the creature is able to telepathically respond to you in a language it knows.

	• You learn the mage hand cantrip. You can cast it without any somatic or verbal components, and the hand has the appearance of your twin's. Your spellcasting ability for the spell is Charisma.</text>

      <text>The act of childbearing is, in itself, a heroic endeavor that women courageously undertake, placing their bodies at risk to ensure the perpetuation of their lineage into the distant future. In most societies, this sacred act has been revered; yet, within the confines of Luyarnha, it can assume an unsettling guise. In this city, certain women find themselves beset by nightmares, only to awaken and, within mere days, experience the telltale nausea of pregnancy, despite their unblemished chastity: blessed by the offspring of a Higher Poweror so it is believed.
	While some regard this union as a divine blessing, it cruelly prevents the expecting mother from ever establishing a family, for the demidritch offspring rends the womb asunder with their foreign constitution during birth. Should the trauma not be swiftly attended to, the mother's life can meet an abrupt end. In response, the church has taken to gathering those who exhibit this miraculous conception to ensure their safety during labor and to exert a modicum of control over the potent half-divine progeny.
	For some women, particularly those of faith or those deemed unworthy of love, the prospect of receiving this so-called blessing is welcomed. Such a union would grant them sanctuary within the church's protective walls for the remainder of their lives, offering them the semblance of a family they might not have otherwise known, however fractured it may be. Yet, others are repulsed by this fate and seek to defy it, often with tragic results. Those who reject the church's embrace might give birth in forsaken alleyways, casting their children away or consigning them to orphanages. A fortunate few, perhaps bolstered by exceptional financial fortitude or familial support, succeed in bearing their offspring and providing them with as normal a childhood as Luyarnha's grim circumstances allow.
	This enigmatic phenomenon has left even the most erudite scholars utterly perplexed. It is widely accepted that the Great Ones are incapable of procreation, and yet. Various theories have been postulated in an attempt to fathom the origins of these peculiar offspring—some conjecture that they serve as beacons, as the Great Ones disseminate their consciousness across the vast reaches of the cosmos, with fragments ultimately embedding themselves within the bodies of these unsuspecting mothers; consequently, the resulting progeny would function as a beacon to draw the Great Ones nearer to the world—others suggest that, due to their intrinsic sterility, the Great Ones crave a surrogate through which to vicariously experience creation. However, the motives of these enigmatic entities are, by their very nature, inscrutable to the mortal mind, and any attempt to decipher their intentions is inherently constrained and flawed.</text>

Beneath the translucent skin of the nebulare flit constellations of multihued lights: galaxy—like swirls and nebulous clouds. In times of great peril, these colorful displays can erupt in a supernova—like display of radiant brilliance, creating localised gravitational fields that help ensure the escape, and continued proliferation, of the nebular demidritch.
	Though the progenitor of the nebulare, an Outer God, has created no new nabulare for some time, the bloodline can go dormant for several generations, manifesting seemingly at random among newborns. Of course, with the Radiant Church experimentation in full swing, whether or not the recurrence of nebulare is really at random is an unanswered question.

      <text>In the days of the First War, an era that marked the initial curiosity of myriad nations towards Luyarnha, a scattering of Dwarves from far-flung reaches of the world found themselves irresistibly drawn to this beleaguered city, a crucible of turmoil and devastation. Amongst those who joined the cause, the majority were mercenaries, whilst others were noble souls seeking to lend aid, and finally a few harbored ambitions of extracting wealth from the faltering nation. As the tides of war shifted, those Dwarves who had chosen to engage in the struggle were offered homes and gold in gratitude for their service, persuading many to remain, forever entwining their destinies with that of the city. The few families that had settled in Luyarnha commenced the trade of precious ores, using their connection to their homeland and harnessing the sophisticated railway system already in place there, thus expanding it within the very walls of the city-state.

Far removed from the splendorous halls of their ancestral kingdoms, the dwarves of Luyarnha have undergone a profound transformation, the likes of which none of their kin foresaw. These once grand merchants perpetrated a sin—coveting that which was not rightfully theirs—and for this dereliction of morality, they begot a curse of unspeakable malevolence, condemning their blood to the compelled service of He Who Lies Dreaming.

      <name>The Cardinal Sin</name>
      <text>"Thou shalt not steal," a dwarven tenet as ancient as their race itself, yet one that an unfortunate number amongst their kin failed to honor. In their homeland, theft was deemed a cardinal sin, punishable to the utmost extent of their laws, at times even by death. Those dwarves harboring avaricious desires deep within, biding their time for the perfect moment to sin unpunished, saw their opportunity amidst the war-torn Luyarnha. Concealed within the ranks of their wellintentioned brethren, they entered Luyarnha only to scatter, some swept away by the tide of war, but those who survived coalesced into marauding bands preying upon the vulnerable. Their plundering persisted until they dared to trespass upon a dwelling that should have remained undisturbed, its walls etched with an archaic language, and its occupant patiently awaiting their intrusion. Unwittingly, they had captured the attention of an entity far more formidable than they could fathom. On that ill-fated day, the lives of these dwarves were irrevocably altered, as they metamorphosed into the Y'ha-nthlei, the enigmatic Deep Ones, a destiny far grimmer than death.</text>

      <name>The Long Night</name>
      <text>A multitude of dwarves had chosen to dwell within the Waterfront district, where the ships dock lay, their shared culture fostering a harmonious coexistence. In a mutually beneficial relationship, they imbued the district with distinct dwarven elements, adding to the gothic architectural landscape and bequeathing the area with a unique aesthetic that endures to this day.
	Yet, the enigmatic Deep Ones, though but a minority amongst Luyarnha's dwarven populace, insidiously encroached upon the Waterfront district. They renounced their thieving ways and instead, embarked upon a sinister campaign of abduction, forcibly indoctrinating their unsuspecting brothers into the worship of their slumbering sovereign, slowly corrupting the inherent goodness that once thrived within the district's walls.
	One fateful night, the Deep Ones executed a vast, coordinated kidnapping, spiriting away hundreds of dwarves in the span of a single, darkened eve — the Long Night. Wanted posters soon plastered the city streets, while the cursed bloods and scions marshaled their forces, and the church dispatched their hunters, all determined to unearth the truth behind the sudden, inexplicable vanishings. And, as mysteriously as they had vanished, the dwarves reappeared, slumbering upon the shoreline, fragrant with the potent aroma of alcohol. The House of Blood's interrogations yielded naught, and soon town criers announced the incident a grand dwarven celebration of the new lunar year, characterized by inebriation and disorientation, leaving the dwarves with no clear memory of the events. Yet from that day forth, a heightened presence of hunters and wardens patrol the district, either to impart a sense of security or, perhaps, because those in authority are privy to some unsettling secret.
	Ever since, the dwarves of Luyarnha have felt a disquieting shift in their lives. Though many remain untouched by the insidious corruption of the Deep Ones' cult, blissfully ignorant of its existence, uncertainty lingers in the air as to how long this fragile equilibrium will endure, before another Long Night befall the remnants of dwarvenkind within Luyarnha, reducing them to nothing but enslaved thralls.</text>

      <text>The Scions, scientists skilled in melding life through electricity to craft manikins and other constructs, grew increasingly reliant upon trade, their experiments demanding gold, mithril and other alloys capable of withstanding the forces of lightning. Yet, as the Scourge surged anew and Luyarnha was once more besieged, the Scions found themselves in dire straits, the resources essential to their groundbreaking research now perilously scarce.
	In this desperate hour, the Y'ha-nthlei emerged, their singular mastery of smuggling enabling them to procure vital materials from beyond the beleaguered city. Young Deep Ones, proficient in navigation and seamanship, who retained greater control over their faculties, could alone navigate the hazardous routes into and out of Luyarnha, defying the lockdown imposed on the city. These enigmatic dwarves proved invaluable to the Scions, and in exchange for their services, the Y'hanthlei furthered their inscrutable goals, burrowing ever deeper into the city's fabric, drawing the unwitting populace closer to the unfathomable depths of their eldritch master's influence.
	Owing to the secretive nature of the Deep Ones and the waning number of "ordinary" dwarves, the race is seen less frequently by the city's denizens. Although they continue to trade and offer their expertise in architectural planning and resource gathering, these skills diminished in importance as the Scourge expanded. Many dwarves adapted their inherent talents to farming, their stout physique ideally suited for laboring within the town's greenhouses, striving alongside others to produce sustenance for the populace. A handful of thrill-seeking dwarves enlisted in the ranks of the hunters, unfortunately a sizeable portion of battle-hardened dwarves unburdened by scruples have already fallen under the thrall of the Y'hanthlei, now toiling to fulfill the sinister objectives of their eldritch master rather than fighting for freedom.</text>

Their once sturdy limbs warp and bend in grotesque fashion, their eyes become sunken and hollow, and their skin takes on a sickly gray pallor. The sanity of their younger days begins to slip away, leaving them at the mercy of His malevolent dreams and to dwell within their once dwarven flesh. This destiny—a fate more dreadful than death—is something that their aging mind anticipates with glee.</text>

	• Coiling Arm. Your arm is nothing but a writhing mass of tentacles that flail the air. On your turn, after hitting an enemy with a melee attack, you can attempt to grapple them as a bonus action (normal grappling restrictions apply).

	• Brutal Pincers. Your forearm—a massive pincer—is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. It you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. If you are targeting a creature you are grappling, the damage die becomes a d10 instead. You cannot use this arm to make any precise hand manipulation.

	• Mucoid Extremities. Your hands and feet are palmed and covered in cups. Your swimming speed increases to 30 feet, and you gain a climbing speed of 20 feet.</text>

Custodians are built as an alternative to golems and commonly find use as butlers, laborers, and cannon fodder. Sentient beings, they are sworn to defend the person —or customer— for whom they were created. The death of their owner often leaves them aimless, wandering the world like masterless hedge knights in search of meaning.

Made to entertain, thespians bring joy to nobles, the clergy, and commoners alike. The only type of manikin designed without lethal intent, these manikins' bodies are supported by invisible, intangible strings, allowing them to move seemingly in defiance of physics. As the plague worsened, the Scions bent their will to producing manikins capable of combating the Scourge, and so the number of thespians has steadily dwindled.

      <text>Scourgebornes should not exist. They are an abomination of the world, a vile curse placed on those who peered beyond the veil and succumbed to madness. Their twisted appearance is but a mirror of the darkest recesses of their personality. All sentient creatures harbor a monster within their soul—the dark of you that resents your neighbor for having a better life than you, that hates your friends when they ignore you, that wishes to harm those that wrong you—most are fortunate enough to be able to hide this monster behind a mask of false virtues. Not the Scourgeborne.
	Their curse has taken all the most twisted aspects of their personality and laid them bare for the whole world to see. They wear this disfigured appearance every day;
the more resentment, hatred and anger one possesses, the more monstrous the appearance.
	Many view this Eldritch revelation as a curse - a curse that drives one to slip deeper and deeper into the depths of depravity until nothing but the monster remains. Yet, many refuse to let it break them - with their innermost darkness now visible, they have no choice but to accept it. It is said that accepting a fault is the first step in correcting it. Those scourgeborne who embrace their inner monster, but refuse to let it rule them, often become messianic heroes within the walls of Luyarnha, attempting to redeem the entire world with their actions, and perhaps one day, themselves.

Your subrace is dictated by an eldritch curse, which doesn't seem to follow a clear reasoning, although it seems that whatever aspect of your personality is most depraved will influence the beast that emerges.

      <text>Scourgebornes should not exist. They are an abomination of the world, a vile curse placed on those who peered beyond the veil and succumbed to madness. Their twisted appearance is but a mirror of the darkest recesses of their personality. All sentient creatures harbor a monster within their soul—the dark of you that resents your neighbor for having a better life than you, that hates your friends when they ignore you, that wishes to harm those that wrong you—most are fortunate enough to be able to hide this monster behind a mask of false virtues. Not the Scourgeborne.
	Their curse has taken all the most twisted aspects of their personality and laid them bare for the whole world to see. They wear this disfigured appearance every day;
the more resentment, hatred and anger one possesses, the more monstrous the appearance.
	Many view this Eldritch revelation as a curse - a curse that drives one to slip deeper and deeper into the depths of depravity until nothing but the monster remains. Yet, many refuse to let it break them - with their innermost darkness now visible, they have no choice but to accept it. It is said that accepting a fault is the first step in correcting it. Those scourgeborne who embrace their inner monster, but refuse to let it rule them, often become messianic heroes within the walls of Luyarnha, attempting to redeem the entire world with their actions, and perhaps one day, themselves.

Your subrace is dictated by an eldritch curse, which doesn't seem to follow a clear reasoning, although it seems that whatever aspect of your personality is most depraved will influence the beast that emerges.

The person who schemes and creates a web of lies around themselves is, unsurprisingly, bound to turn into an aranea. Also known as half-spiders, these scourgeborne differ from others—though many turn, few retain their sanity. Amongst the scourgeborne, araneas are the least trusted, their appearance revealing their former—or current—manipulative personality. Although most citizens understand the need for violence, especially in Luyarnha, none tolerate deception and betrayal.

Those that harbor seething anger within oft turn into the most feral of beasts. Belua—also known as halfwolves—are the most feral of all the Scourgeborne roaming the streets of Luyarnha. Many of them choose to hide their eyes, as their intense bloodlust turns their gaze crimson red, a terrifying sight for the uninitiated.

The rarest amongst the scourgeborne. To become a cervus, also called half-deer or waldschrat, one must have committed the foulest of sins—devouring the flesh of their kin. Or so the rumor went. This urban legend has long since been disproved as many of the town's most trusted figures have turned into such creatures. Interestingly, it seems that those that become cervus are the most apt at fighting creatures of the night, an achievement that earns them the respect of hunters across the city-state.

Those who hid in fear in the face of adversity are cursed to become these beasts of the night. Vespertilio—also known as half-bats—present some of the most accursed beings amongst the scourgeborne. Their unwillingness to see their problems has taken a literal form as most of their sight was stolen from them. Instead, they received half broken wings in a cruel farce of fate, as if to run away from their problems. Yet those who harness these new powers can become some of the fiercest hunters—an act of defiance against fate itself.
