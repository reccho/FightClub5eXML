        <text>Even Acrobats who are not inclined toward larcenous behavior are rarely looked up to by the rest of their society. Acrobats are almost always wanderers, as even a small town quickly tires of its entertainers, so they must move on to the next, where their tricks and displays may be considered new and impressive.

        <name>Aerial Agility (Acrobat (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, you gain the ability to move in flying leaps with incredible speed, precision, and power. Few obstacles can prevent you from reaching your destination.
	When you move, you can instead take two short movements by flying. Each movement is at half your speed, and you must end each one on a creature, solid object, or ground. If you do not, you fall and your movement ends.
	In addition you gain proficiency in the Acrobatics skill and a climbing speed equal to half your walking speed.

        <text>Shadowdancers operate in the border between light and darkness. They use their talents and an innate connection to the Shadowfell to move and hide between the planes, a technique known as shadowdancing. As a Shadowdancer becomes more experienced, they can even command the shadows to do their bidding.

        <text>Starting at 17th level, you can reach into the Shadowfell and use your action to cause two shadows to appear in unoccupied spaces you can see within 60 feet of you.
