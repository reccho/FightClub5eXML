        <name>Arcane Tradition: Invention (HB)</name>
        <text>Adherents of this school believe that innovation is best served through experimentation. These wizards craft strange mechanical armor that not only provides protection, but it is also designed to help the wizard channel magic in unpredictable ways. Wizards of this tradition are regarded as geniuses to their faces, but wizards of other traditions often think of them as lunatics.

        <name>Alchemical Armor (Invention (HB))</name>
        <text>Innovation is a dangerous practice, at least as far as members of this school practice it. As a shield against this risk, you have developed a suit of mechanical armor infused with magic formulas.
	Starting at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with light armor and gain a suit of alchemical armor—a magic item that only you can attune to. While you are attuned to it and wearing it, it grants you resistance to force damage and you can use the armor as a spellcasting focus by extending one of your hands, so long as that hand is free.
	The armor is light armor and provides an AC of 11 + your Intelligence modifier. It weighs 8 pounds.
	You can create a new suit of it at the end of a long rest by touching a nonmagical suit of leather or studded leather armor, which magically transforms it. Doing so removes the magic from your previous alchemical armor, turning it back into nonmagical leather or studded leather.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Infused Armor (Invention (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level, your armor gains 2 magical effects from the following table. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can choose 2 effects from the table. Your armor gains those effects, and loses any previous effects it had.

Infused Armor:
Required Wizard Level | Armor Effect
2nd | Elemental Resistance: You have resistance to one of the following damage types. Acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. Starting at 10th level, you can choose this effect multiple times, choosing a different damage type each time.
2nd | Arcane Buffer: As a bonus action, you gain temporary hit points equal to half your Wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. You can use this feature twice.
2nd | Shock Proof: You have advantage on rolls made to resist being stunned or paralyzed.
6th | Unstable Field: Whenever a creature hits you with a melee attack you can use your reaction to deal 1d6 force damage to the attacker.
6th | Agile Armor: You are constantly under the effects of the jump and longstrider spells.
10th | Stabilizer: You are constantly under the effects of the spider climb spell.
10th | Flight Suit: You can cast fly (no concentration) on yourself once without expending a spell slot.
14th | Active Defenses: You can cast the shield spell three times without expending a spell slot.
14th | Stealth Suit: You can use your bonus action to become invisible for 1 minute or until you attack or cast a spell. You can use this feature twice.
14th | Spell Shielding: Whenever you make a saving throw against a spell or a magical effect, you can use your reaction to gain advantage on that roll.

        <name>Formulate Scrolls (Invention (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 6th level, while you are wearing your Alchemical Armor, you can tap into your reserves of magical energy to create spell scrolls. You can use your Arcane Recovery ability to create a scroll instead of regaining expended spell slots.
	You must finish a short rest, then spend 10 minutes with parchment, quill, and ink to create a spell scroll containing one spell chosen from those you know. Subtract the spell's level from the total levels worth of slots you regain using Arcane Recovery. This reduction to your Arcane Recovery applies until you use the scroll and then finish a long rest.

        <name>Improved Infusion (Invention (HB))</name>
        <text>At 10th level, the armor's potency increases. It gains +2 AC, and whenever you finish a long rest, you can choose 1 additional effect from the table.
	In addition, you can use your action to shift one of the magical effects from your Infused Armor to an ally within 60 feet that you can see. The armor loses that effect, and the ally gains that effect until you use this feature again or you and the ally are separated by more than 60 feet.

        <name>Alchemical Inscription (Invention (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 14th level, you learn glyph of warding as a wizard spell. While you are wearing your Alchemical Armor, you can cast the "Spell Glyph" effect of the glyph of warding spell without requiring material components. You follow other rules normally for casting it, including expending a spell slot. A glyph inscribed in this manner lasts until you finish a long rest, instead of its normal duration.
	Once you inscribe a rune using this feature you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Arcane Tradition: Lore Mastery (HB)</name>
        <text>Lore Mastery is an arcane tradition fixated on understanding the underlying mechanics of magic. It is the most academic of all arcane traditions. Known as savants, followers of this tradition are a bookish lot who see beauty and mystery in the application of magic. The promise of uncovering new knowledge or proving (or discrediting) a theory of magic is usually required to rouse its practitioners from their laboratories, academies, and archives to pursue a life of adventure.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Lore Savant (Lore Mastery (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you become a compendium of knowledge on a vast array of topics. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses the Arcana or History skill if you are proficient in that skill.
	In addition, your analytical abilities are so well-honed that your initiative in combat can be driven by mental agility, rather than physical agility. When you roll initiative, it is either an Intelligence check or a Dexterity check for you (your choice).

        <name>Alchemical Dualism (Lore Mastery (HB))</name>
        <text>At 2nd level, you master the first in a series of arcane secrets uncovered by your extensive studies. When you cast a spell with a spell slot and the spell deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, poison, radiant, or thunder damage, you can substitute that damage type with its alchemically paired damage type (you can change only one damage type per casting of a spell). You replace one energy type for another by altering the spell's formula as you cast it. The paired damage types are as follows.

Acid —— Poison
Cold —— Fire
Lightning —— Thunder
Necrotic —— Radiant

        <text>Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell with a spell slot and the spell requires a saving throw, you can change the saving throw from one ability score to another of your choice. If the spell requires multiple saving throws, only the first is changed. Once you change a saving throw in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

        <name>Master of Magic (Lore Mastery (HB))</name>
        <text>At 14th level, your knowledge of magic allows you to duplicate almost any spell. As a bonus action, you can call to mind the ability to cast one 8th-level or lower spell of your choice from any class's spell list. The spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, you mustn't have it prepared, and you follow the normal rules for casting it, including expending a spell slot. If the spell isn't a wizard spell, it counts as a wizard spell when you cast it. The ability to cast the spell vanishes from your mind when you cast it or when the current turn ends.
	Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
