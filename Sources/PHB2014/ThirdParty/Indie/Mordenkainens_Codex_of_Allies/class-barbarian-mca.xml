        <text>Some barbarians are compelled by their innate bloodlust to follow The Path of the Bloodrager. Bloodragers are perilous front line combatants that can devastate foes with a power linked to bloodshed. These barbarians, like berserkers, revel in violence and take little account for their well-being in battle. Wherever they can be found, Bloodragers fight until they can stand no longer.
