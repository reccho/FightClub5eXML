        <name>Bard College: Satire (HB)</name>
        <text>Bards of the College of Satire are called jesters. While jesters are masters of puns, jokes, and verbal barbs, they are much more than just comic relief. Among bards, jesters are unmatched acrobats, and their ability to tumble, dodge, leap, and climb makes them slippery opponents in battle.

        <name>Tumbling Fool (Satire (HB))</name>
        <text>At 3rd level, you master an acrobatic technique known as tumbling that allows you to evade danger. When you tumble you move a number of feet up to half your walking speed without provoking opportunity attacks. You can tumble as a bonus action. Starting at 6th level you can also tumble as a reaction when you are attacked, imposing disadvantage on the triggering attack.
	In addition, after tumbling until the start of your next turn you gain a climbing speed equal to half your walking speed and you take half damage from falling. Tumbling does not cost you any feet of movement.

        <name>Insult to Injury (Satire (HB))</name>
        <text>At 6th level, your wit has become as sharp as a rapier, and twice as quick. You learn the vicious mockery cantrip. If you already know it, you learn one other bard cantrip of your choice. When you use your action to make an attack on your turn, you can use the vicious mockery cantrip as a bonus action.
	If a creature fails the saving throw against your vicious mockery, you can expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the target's Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom rolls until the end of its next turn. The creature also immediately suffers an embarrassing social gaffe. It might loudly pass gas, unleash a thunderous burp, trip and fall, or be compelled to tell a tasteless joke.

        <text>At 14th level you learn tasha's hideous laughter as a bard spell. If you already know it, you learn one other 1st level bard spell of your choice. When you fail a saving throw or miss an attack roll, you may use your reaction to cast tasha's hideous laughter on a creature you can see without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. You may cast it this way a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

        <name>Bard College: Skald (HB)</name>
        <text>For the clans of the north, the history of their people and the stories of the gods are carried in the tales told by the warrior poets, skalds. Skalds make history come alive, and in battle their rousing words can bring to bear the fury of an ancient battlefield. Skalds embolden their allies with tales of the legendary warriors of old.

        <name>War Song (Skald (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, you learn to perform a war song to embolden your allies. You can use your bonus action to begin your war song, which requires concentration and lasts one minute. When you begin performing your war song or as a bonus action while you are concentrating on your war song, you can choose up to three allies within 60 feet of you that can hear you. You can also choose yourself in place of one of the targets. Once before the end of your next turn, the targeted allies can roll a 1d4 when rolling damage for a melee weapon attack and add the number rolled to the damage roll. Once you perform a war song, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
	You may target one additional humanoid with your war song starting at 6th level and 14th level.

        <text>Starting at 3rd level, whenever you use your bonus action to use the effect of your war song you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to incite fury in your allies. The targeted allies can roll a bardic inspiration die instead of a 1d4 when rolling damage for a melee weapon attack, and can move up to 5 feet without provoking opportunity attacks in addition to the attack's other effects.

        <name>Words of Brutality (Skald (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 6th level, if you spend 1 minute conversing with a creature, you can attempt to leave a simmering violence in its mind. At the end of the minute, you can use an action to force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC to resist feeling violent urges against one creature you describe to it or name. The save automatically succeeds if the target is immune to being charmed. On a failed save, the target attacks the chosen creature if it sees that creature within the next 10 minutes, using weapons or spells against a creature it was already hostile toward or unarmed strikes against an ally or a creature it was neutral toward.
	Once the fight starts, it continues to attack for 5 rounds before this effect ends. This effect ends immediately if the target or any ally it can see is attacked or takes damage from any creature other than the one it has been incited against. On a successful save, the creature is unaffected and has no inkling of your attempt to bend its will.
	Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
