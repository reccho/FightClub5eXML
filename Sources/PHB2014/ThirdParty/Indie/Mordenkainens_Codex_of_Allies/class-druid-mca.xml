        <text>When a druid's forest burns down, there are an occasional few who find a newfound power awakened by the inferno. These druids find within themselves an inner fire that fills them with burning passion and allows them to become frightening wielders of magical fire. Like the wildfire, they burn away the old and dead so that new life can spring up from the ashes.

        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your bonus action and expend a spell slot to allow the fire burning within you to emerge as a glowing flame that surrounds your body for 1 minute, or until you are incapacitated. The flame casts bright light for 15 feet and dim light for an additional 15 feet. You can choose the color of the flame and the color of the light that it casts.
	While this flame burns, whenever a creature within 15 feet of you that you can see casts a spell or makes an attack against you or an ally, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take 1d6 fire damage per level of the spell slot expended and be ignited. An ignited creature takes 1d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns until they or another creature douses the fire as an action, or they move more than 15 feet away from you.

Ancient Sage. A swirling green aura surrounds your familiar and it gains the ability to move through solid surfaces made of trees or plants, but it cannot willingly end its turn there.
	In addition, whenever an ally within 5 feet of your spirit companion makes a saving throw against a spell, you can use your reaction to grant that ally advantage on the saving throw.

Death Stalker. A red light glows deep within your familiar's eyes as it gains a number of temporary hit points equal to your druid level.
	In addition, whenever your familiar or an ally within 5 feet of your spirit companion deals damage with an attack, you can use your reaction to add a bonus to the damage roll equal to your druid level.

        <text>Starting at 6th level, when you use your Wild Shape feature while you are within 100 feet of a familiar you have summoned using your Spirit Companion feature, you can empower your familiar rather than transforming, gaining the following benefits. The beast form is still a familiar and retains any applicable benefits.

	• Your familiar undergoes a transformation into a beast with a maximum CR of 1/4. Starting at 9th level the maximum CR increases to 1/2, and at 14th level the maximum CR increases to 1. Unlike the druid, the familiar's wild shape does not have a limitation on flying or swimming speed and it can transform into swarms. If your familiar is reduced to 0 hit points while in this form, its transformation ends and it returns to being a tiny familiar.

	• The beast form loses its Multiattack action, if it has one.

	• Your familiar uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own while transformed. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, a transformed familiar also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls.

	• Your familiar can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). It then reverts to its normal form unless you expend another use of this feature, or until you use your Wild Shape again.
