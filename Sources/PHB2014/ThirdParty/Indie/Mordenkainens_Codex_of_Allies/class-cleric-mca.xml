        <name>Babbling Lunatic (Madness (HB))</name>
        <text>At 1st level, you can babble in the tongue of the gods to unsettle the minds of your foes. You learn the vicious mockery cantrip.
	In addition, whenever you use the vicious mockery cantrip, you can target one additional creature within range that can hear you. That creature must make a Wisdom save against the cantrip or have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn. The additional target does not take any damage.

        <name>Channel Divinity: Cultist's Chant (Madness (HB))</name>
        <text>At 2nd level, as an action you can use your Channel Divinity to chant in an ancient tongue to put your listener into a stupefied trance. Each creature of your choice that can hear you within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be charmed by you. This effect ends on a target after 1 minute, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies.

        <name>Channel Divinity: Read Thoughts (Madness (HB))</name>
        <text>At 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to read a creature's thoughts. You can then use your access to the creature's mind to command it. As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. If the creature succeeds on the saving throw, you can't use this feature on it again until you finish a long rest.
	If the creature fails its save, you can read its surface thoughts (those foremost in its mind, reflecting its current emotions and what it is actively thinking about) when it is within 60 feet of you. This effect lasts for 1 minute.
	During that time, you can use your action to end this effect and cast the suggestion spell on the creature without expending a spell slot. The target automatically fails its saving throw against the spell.

        <name>Irreversible Insanity (Madness (HB))</name>
        <text>At 17th level, your mind is lost to the endless madness of the gods. You become immune to psychic damage and to the charmed and frightened conditions. Whenever a creature tries to read your thoughts, that creature takes 3d8 psychic damage as it hears the maddening tongues within your head.
	In addition, roll once on the Indefinite Madness table (DMG p. 260). You are afflicted with that madness and it cannot be cured.

        <name>Divine Domain: Protection (HB)</name>
        <text>The protection domain is the purview of deities who charge their followers to shield the weak from the strong. The gods' faithful dwell in villages and towns on the borderlands, where they help bolster defenses and seek out evils to defeat. These gods believe that a strong shield and a suit of armor is the best defense against evil, second only to a stout mace on hand to respond to any attacks in kind. Deities who grant this domain include Helm, Ilmater, Torm, Tyr, Heironeous, St. Cuthbert, Paladine, Dol Dorn, the Silver Flame, Bahamut, Yondalla, Athena, and Odin.

Domain Spells:
At each indicated cleric level, add the listed spells to your spells prepared. They do not count towards your limit.

Protection Domain Spells:
Cleric Level | Spells
1st | compelled duel, shield of faith
3rd | aid, warding bond
5th | magic circle, protection from energy
7th | guardian of faith, Otiluke's resilient sphere
9th | antilife shell, wall of force

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Resolute Shield (Protection (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to hinder attacks intended for others. When a creature attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. To do so, you must be able to see both the attacker and the target. You interpose a shield of divine energy to throw the attack off target. If your reaction causes the attack to miss, the attacker cannot attack the target you protected until the start of your next turn.
	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), and you regain any expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

        <name>Channel Divinity: Radiant Armor (Protection (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to cloak your allies in radiant armor. As an action, you channel blessed energy into an ally that you can see within 30 feet of you. The target gains a number of temporary hit points equal to 2d6 + your cleric level. These hit points last for 1 minute. Whenever the ally is hit with an attack while any of these hit points remain, the attacker takes radiant damage equal to the damage dealt to the temporary hit points gained by using this feature.

        <text>At 17th level, your faith allows you to protect your allies with powerful divine magic. As a bonus action, you can choose one ally within 30 feet of you to protect with a holy shield. As long as you are not incapacitated, that ally's AC becomes the same as your AC, unless it was already higher. The effect ends early if you and the ally are separated by more than 30 feet, or if you use this feature again.
