        <name>Murder of Ravens (Death's Mistress (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting when you devote yourself to this patron at 1st level, you learn to summon ravens from the Shadowfell to deliver the souls of the dead.
	Whenever a humanoid within 30 feet of you is reduced to 0 hit points and dies, you can use your reaction to summon a raven spirit in the square the creature occupied prior to its death. The spirit assumes the form and game statistics of a raven, and it always obeys your commands, which you can give telepathically while it is within 100 feet of you. A raven vanishes when it dies, if you die, or if the two of you are separated by more than 5 miles.
	If you have a raven spirit previously summoned, and you summon another, the ravens flock together, and attempt to occupy the same space at all times. If you have 5 or more ravens flocking together in this way, you may permanently band the flock together as a swarm. The flock of ravens assumes the form and game statistics of a a swarm of ravens. The maximum number of raven spirits you can maintain at once is equal to half your warlock level.
	In combat, the ravens and swarms move and act as a group and take their turn immediately after your turn. You control how the group acts.
	If a raven is slain by a creature, or a swarm is damaged by a creature you gain advantage on all attack rolls against the creature until the end of your next turn.
	At the end of a short or long rest, you can call all the ravens back to you—no matter where they are—and they reappear within 5 feet of you. At the end of a long rest, you may spend one spell slot to summon a number of ravens up to half your warlock level, but not exceeding the maximum.

        <name>Curse of the Deep (Kraken (HB))</name>
        <text>When you devote yourself to this patron at 1st level, you learn the secret of infusing your spells with a watery curse. You also learn one cantrip of your choice that deals cold or lightning damage from any spell list.
	When you hit a creature with a spell attack or when a creature fails a saving throw against your spell or cantrip, you can curse the target for 1 minute or until you curse a different creature with this feature.
	Once per turn when you cast a spell, you can trigger the curse if that spell deals cold or lightning damage to the cursed target or forces it to move. Doing so subjects the target to the appropriate additional effect below, and then the curse ends if the spell that triggered the curse isn't a cantrip (you choose the effect to use if more than one effect applies):

Cold Damage. If the affected target takes cold damage from your spell, the target's speed is also reduced by 15 feet until the end of your next turn. If the spell already reduces the target's speed, use whichever reduction is greater.

Lightning Damage. If the affected target takes lightning damage from your spell, the target cannot take reactions until the start of your next turn.

Forced Movement. If the target is moved by your spell, increase the distance it is moved by 15 feet.
