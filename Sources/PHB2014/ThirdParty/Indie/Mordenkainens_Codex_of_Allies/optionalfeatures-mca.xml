    <text>Prerequisite: Death's Mistress Patron, Pact of the Tome Feature

You can place a corpse's hand or similar appendage on your Book of Shadows and ask one question aloud. After 1 minute, the answer appears written in blood in your book. The answer is provided by the dead creature's spirit to the best of its knowledge and is translated into a language of your choice. You must use this ability within 1 hour of a creature's death, and a given creature can only be asked one question in this manner.

    <name>Invocation: Blessing of the Slime Lord (HB)</name>
    <level>0</level>
    <classes>Eldritch Invocations</classes>
    <text>Prerequisite: 9th level, Slime Lord patron

The Slime Lord grants you the ability to summon moving patches of slime mold. You can cast grease twice without expending a spell slot or material components.
	In addition, whenever you are concentrating on the grease spell, you can use your bonus action to move the covered area up to 10 feet across the ground and other surfaces. If the grease moves into the area occupied by a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity save against your spell save DC or fall prone.

Prone:
	• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
	• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
	• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.
