        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Inquisition (HB)</name>
        <text>Paladins who take the Oath of Inquisition are commonly called Inquisitors. An Inquisitor has devoted his life to finding and eliminating practitioners of evil magic. A scholar as well as a warrior, the Inquisitor is unyielding in their efforts to thwart the clerics and wizards who have aligned with the forces of darkness.

Tenets of Inquisition:
To an Inquisitor, magic is a sacred force. A spellcaster who refuses to renounce evil invites the fire of an Inquisitor's wrath.

Purity in Magic. To be endowed with magic is a blessing, and mine is to be used righteously.

Know thy Truth. I shall speak forthright, and with no fear of reprimand, for I speak the truth.

Cast Out Evil. The twisted monsters and evil magic users are blemishes upon this world. With my oath, I swear to cleanse and purify them.

Oath Spells:
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

Oath of Inquisition Spells:
Paladin Level | Spells
3rd | searing smite, detect magic
5th | silence, zone of truth
9th | remove curse, dispel magic
13th | banishment, Otiluke's resilient sphere
17th | circle of power, dispel evil and good

        <name>Channel Divinity: Kneel, Heathen (Oath of Inquisition (HB))</name>
        <text>As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to force one creature that can see and hear you within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw the creature falls prone, and ends its turn at the start of each of its turns for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. At the end of each of the creature's turns it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

        <text>As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to ask a question of one creature that can see and hear you within 30 feet of you. The question must be phrased so that it can be answered with a yes or no, otherwise this ability fails. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it replies with a truthful answer. A creature is immune to this ability if it is immune to being charmed.

        <text>Starting at 7th level, you emanate an aura that quells magic while you're not incapacitated. The aura extends 15 feet from you in every direction. Whenever any enemy within the aura makes a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration, it has disadvantage on that save. In addition, whenever any ally within the aura makes a save to avoid becoming charmed, frightened, paralyzed, or stunned by a magical effect, it has advantage on that save.
	At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

        <text>At 20th level, you become an embodiment of divine justice, a grand inquisitor. As an action, you can surround yourself with a radiant glow gaining the following benefits for 1 minute.

	• You have resistance to acid, fire, lightning, necrotic, radiant, and thunder damage.

	• Whenever a creature within 30 feet of you damages you or casts a spell that creature takes 2d6 fire damage and must make a Constitution saving throw or ignite in flames. At the start of each of its turns until the effect ends, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 2d6 fire damage. On a successful save, the effect ends. If the target or a creature within 5 feet of it uses an action to put out the flames, or if some other effect douses the flames (such as the target being submerged in water), the effect ends.

Once you use this feature you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Pestilence (HB)</name>
        <text>Some paladins worship dark gods, corrupting their healing abilities and restoration into curses, plagues, and blights. Where other paladins heal the sick and blind, paladins of this oath, occasionally called antipaladins, afflict their victims with fear, madness, and disease.

Tenets of Pestilence:
This oath emphasizes blighting, corrupting, inverting and distorting the enemies of the paladin in service of their dark calling.

Spread the Rot. Where there is hope, squelch it, where there is fear, stoke it, when your foes are in agony, let it fester.

Corrupt the Righteous. Reveal the darkness that lies in the heart of all mortal creatures.

Cull the Weak. Without plague and strife, the weak will multiply and the strong cannot rise.

Oath Spells:
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

Oath of Pestilence Spells:
Paladin Level | Spells
3rd | bane, inflict wounds
5th | blindness/deafness, ray of enfeeblement
9th | bestow curse, vampiric touch
13th | blight, giant insect
17th | contagion, insect plague

        <text>You can use your Channel Divinity to exude a menacing presence. As an action, you force each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. The frightened creature can repeat this saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Frightened:
	• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
	• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.

When you touch a creature in this way, you can spend hit points from your Lay on Hands pool, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool, to deal necrotic damage equal to the number of hit points spent + your Charisma modifier, and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.

When a creature under the effect of your Terrifying Presence fails its saving throw against being frightened at the start of its turn, you can roll a die. If you roll an odd number, the frightened target moves half its speed in a random direction and takes no action on that turn, other than to scream in terror. If you roll an even number, the frightened target makes one melee attack against a random target within its reach. If there is no such target, it moves half its speed in a random direction and takes no action on that turn. You can use this feature up to three times each round.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Treachery (HB)</name>
        <text>Commonly known as blackguards, these profane warriors are faithful only to trickster gods, demons lords, or their own image. These paladins make backstabbing and duplicity an art among their ranks. Even the Lords of Hell are loath to ally with these champions of discord, but sometimes Baalzebul and Glasya find a kindred spirit in a blackguard's penchant for double dealing and treachery.

Tenets of Treachery:
A paladin who embraces the Oath of Treachery owes allegiance to no one. There are no tenets of this oath, for it lacks any substance. Those who are unfortunate enough to have close contact with blackguards have observed that a blackguard's overwhelming concern is power and safety, especially if both can be obtained at the expense of others.

Oath Spells:
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

Oath of Treachery Spells:
Paladin Level | Spells
3rd | charm person, disguise self
5th | invisibility, mirror image
9th | feign death, haste
13th | confusion, greater invisibility
17th | dominate person, mislead

        <name>Channel Duplicity: Conjure Duplicate (Oath of Treachery (HB))</name>
        <text>As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to create a visual illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. The illusion looks exactly like you; it is silent; it is your size, is insubstantial, and doesn't occupy its space; and it is unaffected by attacks and damage. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but the illusion must remain within 120 feet of you. For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how uncanny the illusion is.

        <text>Starting at 10th level, as an action you can use your Channel Divinity to utter a charmed word to a creature within 60 feet of you that can hear you. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to your spell save DC) or you control its next action, provided that you aren't incapacitated when it takes the action. A creature automatically succeeds on the save if the creature is immune to being charmed.

Despairing Presence. Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you makes a saving throw you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that saving throw.

Treacherous Avoidance. If a creature within 5 feet of you misses you with a melee attack, or makes a melee attack against an illusionary duplicate of yourself, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to reroll that attack against a creature of your choice that is also within 5 feet of the attacker. You can use this ability three times. You regain expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.
