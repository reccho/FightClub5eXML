      <name>Description</name>
      <text>The summer elves are well-known for their hedonistic and sociable nature. Living life to the fullest, they constantly seek new experiences and pleasures. These elves embody the teachings of their patron deity, Òigridh, the Lady of Summer and Queen of Fire, who champions the pursuit of positive emotions and hope.
	Their vibrant and luxurious lifestyle often leads summer elves to confront penumbral creatures such as penumbral envys, greeds, gluttonies, and lusts. Driven by disdain for the Ungods' corruption of emotions, they strive to bring positivity and hope to those they encounter. Engaging with penumbral creatures is an inherent part of their journey to promote new experiences and combat the forces of darkness.
	Summer elves are particularly drawn to the company of humans, finding their constant change and strong emotions captivating. They often live and travel between human cities, embracing their dynamic nature and thriving in their diverse communities. This proximity leads to most of the half-elves in Tanares being half-summer elves, a testament to the deep connection formed between them.
	As natural wanderers, many summer elves become traders and merchants. Their deity, Òigridh, views trade as an act that brings happiness to both parties involved, considering it an essential means of spreading positivity and weakening the Ungods. In their travels, summer elves explore new experiences, including diverse forms of art, unique individuals, captivating music, and exotic drinks. They often establish connections and relationships with various cultures, enriching their knowledge and understanding of the world.
	Summer elves typically exhibit darker skin tones and beautiful black hair, often kept long and styled in intricate ways. Their attire is as exuberant and expressive as their personalities, frequently featuring fine, vibrant clothing that showcases their love for art and emotion. This striking appearance reflects their inner passion and the vivacity they infuse into every aspect of their lives.

      <text>The spring elves of Tanares are a deeply spiritual and dedicated group, entrusted with the critical task of caring for the ten remaining Mother Trees in the Sindile Forest. These mighty trees, originally twelve in number, are essential to maintaining balance in the world, as they filter out negative emotions and combat the corruptive influence of the Ungods.
	The health and color of the Mother Trees serve as a visual indicator of the world's level of corruption. As the trees darken, the spring elves know that it's time to perform rituals using rare herbs and their unique druidic magic. These cleansing ceremonies purify the trees, enabling them to continue their vital work of filtering out corruption.
	Spring elves have round facial features, and their hair is usually brown or dark blond. They are shorter and slimmer but possess more strength than meets the eye.
	Spring elves are led by the Guardians, an elite group of warriors dedicated to defending their home forest. These skilled archers boast exceptional camouflage abilities, blending seamlessly into their surroundings. Some Guardians wield powerful arrows crafted from the branches of the Mother Trees, imbuing their attacks with potent mystical energy. All of their weapons are made from the enchanted wood found only in Sindile.
	In addition to their guardianship duties, spring elves cultivate and nurture the trees that grow in the presence of the Mother Trees. This special care results in the creation of enchanted wood, a resilient and magical material with a wide range of applications. From weapons and shields to ships and buildings, this enchanted wood enables the construction of items far stronger and more durable.

      <text>The autumn elves have an innate sense of nobility, exceptional mastery of magic, and a strong sense of duty. Particularly skilled in abjuration, illusion, and wind magic, these elves have honed their abilities to create intricate wards and magically enchanted pylons, setting them apart from other elven subcultures.
	Autumn elves typically possess regal, stern features that convey their sense of nobility and seriousness. With sharp, angular facial structures, they exude an air of authority and wisdom, reflecting their dedication to the magic pursuit and their serious belief in noblesse oblige.
	Their advanced magical prowess has enabled the autumn elves to construct entire flying cities, which showcase their exceptional talent in manipulating reality. By employing arrays of illusions, they can create tangible mirages, that can be touched or used as real objects, that can defy the laws of physics, provide individuals with the power of flight through illusory wings, and even conjure mythical servant creatures that possess combat capabilities.
	To maintain their cities' unique defenses and magical constructs, autumn elves must periodically shift their cities to the Penumbral Plane and harvest mystical energy from penumbral creatures. Elite groups of mystical knights, often supported by mercenaries and adventurers, are tasked with this vital responsibility.
	Aibidh, the Lord of Autumn and King of Wind, bestows the most accomplished mystical knights with stormbirds as their steeds. These elemental creatures of the storm serve as loyal and powerful mounts, further enhancing the noble warriors' combat prowess and ability to navigate the treacherous Penumbral Plane.

      <text>The winter elves and the kemets, two factions of the same species, share a common origin but differ in their goals and beliefs. Their dark, grayish, or purple skin and contrasting white hair complement their incredible strength, which belies their slender frames. Their proud, cold, and obstinate demeanor reflects their advanced culture, characterized by patience, wisdom, and an acceptance of death.
	The Elf Migrations led these beings to settle in the frigid region of Reginheraht, where they became known as winter elves. They sought power and knowledge to purify their goddess Bás of corruption and restore her benevolent nature. This quest led them to explore various planes, including the Penumbral Plane, where dark entities manipulated them. The winter elves discovered a prophecy foretelling the world's end at the hands of the Ungods, stating that the kemets must conquer the world to prevent this fate. Desperate and recognizing elements of the prophecy in their reality, they changed their name to kemets and resolved to fulfill the prophecy.
	The kemets adopted a militaristic society, subjugating the Kepesh people from the continent of Darkall and seizing their necromantic knowledge. They organized themselves into family clans dwelling in pyramid-shaped structures, symbolizing their mastery over death. The use of undead became commonplace, from menial tasks in their cities to military operations.
	Centuries after conquering Darkall, the kemets invaded Tanares, expecting victory and prophecy fulfillment. However, their invasion failed, and they spiraled into despair, resigned to the world's inevitable end. Bás, the goddess of winter and death, offered them another path. While some kemets deserted, many joined Bás' cult, seeking to create a realm of eternal ice and undeath, impervious to the Ungods' corruption.
	Conversely, those kemets who repented after the war reverted to being called winter elves. Led by Baraelmer, they aim to redeem the kemets and restore Bás' benevolence. They continue to practice necromancy and employ undead, but now honor the dead by only using the bodies of those who permit it after death.
	Baraelmer's winter elves assist the Republic in defending the coasts against the kemet's undead-powered fleet, stationed in the Storm Islands. Their expertise in naval warfare and newly rediscovered water elementalism helps to counter the kemet's advantage at sea.

      <name>Culture of Necromancy</name>
      <text>Only twenty years ago, the winter elves and kemets were a single, united group. However, the failure of the Kemet Invasion caused a schism that split them into distinct factions. Despite this separation, both groups share core cultural traits deeply rooted in necromancy and mastery over death, a knowledge they stole from the Kepesh.
	The living and the undead coexist seamlessly in their cities. Undead horses pull wagons, and mindless undead perform menial tasks like cleaning or guarding locations. This integration into daily life demonstrates how both factions have overcome the fear of death. Moreover, the undead serve a crucial role in their military, forming the backbone of infantry troops. Their emotionless nature and the lack of families and loved ones prevent the Ungods from gaining power when the undeads are destroyed in battle, making them excellent troops to reduce the chances of a Malrokian Curse cataclysm.
	Both winter elves and kemets organize themselves into clan-based societies. Prominent clans reside in massive pyramid-shaped buildings, which serve as both residences and bureaucratic centers. A hierarchy extends from the ancient Patriarchs and Matriarchs at the summit to lower-ranking members at the base, where public offices and accessible areas can be found.
	Though the winter elves and kemets have diverged in beliefs and goals, their necromantic practices remain a key element of their cultures. The winter elves, now allied with the Republic of Freelands, are relearning their ancient water elementalism and using their necromancy and naval knowledge to battle Gullog's forces. They have recently formed a close bond with the Celestianist clerics of Bauron to exchange information on undead control and elimination. Conversely, the kemets embrace the evil tainted ice elementalism, wielding it to empower their undead hordes. Their shared foundation in necromancy continues to shape both factions, even as they carve out unique paths in the aftermath of the Kemet Invasion.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Bearers of two souls and two personalities, these angel-like beings organize themselves in knightly orders dedicated to eradication of the Ungods and to accomplish their divine calling.

 "We do not hail from the heavens, yet we carry a celestial man date. We have savored the bliss of serenity and divine favor, as well as the harshness of adversity and decay. As each sun rises, we venture into fresh encounters and acquire precious insights that we ought to cherish and impart. Just as a single feather cannot take flight, but a pair can, dual spirits must unite to uncover that which remains hidden from plain sight."
- Zafara, Elder of the Order of Celestial Balance.

In a realm beset by insidious corruption, the cirrus arise as unwavering guardians against the relentless encroachment of malevolence. These celestial-like beings, akin to angels, captivate with their clear blue skin and the majestic wings of their elders. The cirrus embodies the duality of arcane and divine forces, as two souls meld within a single form, intertwining the stark contrast of light and darkness into an unbreakable bond.
	Held together by honor, the cirrus adhere to a stringent code of chivalry and virtues, each exemplified by the unique orders of the Zephyr Knights. These orders represent the cirrus' unfaltering commitment to the essential principles bestowed by the gods, forging a unified front against the otherworldly monstrosities known as the Ungods.
	To the cirrus, the dichotomy of arcane and divine magic transcends mere choice in spellcasting, representing the very essence of their duality. Arcane symbolizes logic, reality, and physicality, while divine signifies wisdom, spirituality, and transcendence. This harmonious equilibrium permeates every facet of their lives, shaping their beliefs and guiding their actions in the ceaseless battle against the forces of insanity emanating from the Penumbral Plane.
	The unity of all Zephyr Knight Orders, distinguished by unique colors and virtues, forges the cirrus into an indomitable force against the Ungods. Through their mastery of arcane and divine energies, they display an unrivaled command of magic, reinforced by their unfaltering dedication to their cause. Amidst adversity, the cirrus stand strong, their unity forming an impervious bulwark against the corrupt ing influence of the Ungods. Though their various knightly orders may harbor diverse opinions and occasionally clash, the Zephyr Knights remain united in their battle against the sinister eldritch beings.
	The celestial nature of the cirrus transcends mere aesthetics; it instills within them an innate sense of purpose, guiding their crusade against the encroaching darkness. As embodiments of balance and harmony, they comprehend the significance of divine order and strive to reestablish equilibrium where corruption seeks to take root. In their youth, each cirrus experiences a divine revelation, imbued with a virtue they must embody and pursue throughout their lives. This revelation directs their path, and the majority join a Zephyr Knight order aligned with their bestowed virtue. Cirrus who abstain from joining an order at adulthood become outcasts, living in exile from their kin and seeking their life's meaning independently. Some reject their calling, while others embrace it further, believing their destiny lies beyond the preconceptions and dogmatism of the orders.
	Their foes, the abhorrent Ungods, represent a desecration of existence, a force the cirrus have vowed to eliminate. These extraplanar deities radiate a corrupting influence, intent on unraveling the fabric of reality and heralding an age of mad ness. Against this unfathomable menace, the cirrus stand resolute, united under the banners of their knight orders and driven by the unwavering conviction of ultimate triumph.

      <name>Cirrus History</name>
      <text>In the dawn of the Godly Age, when angelic hands aid ed sculpting the foundations of creation, the cirrus species emerged—blessed with celestial grace by the angels and entrusted to share the divine word among mortals. However, destiny's path twisted, and they were summoned to war against the looming darkness of the Ungods. As the Ungod Invasion began, the cirrus mustered their unwavering faith and resisted the malevolent tide. Yet, faith alone proved insufficient; they were driven to forge weapons, establish knightly orders, and ultimately, unravel the enigmas of magic and wizardry. Thus, the cirrus unveiled their true potential, merging arcane prowess with divine conviction to confront the Ungods' servants. The Zephyr Knight Orders were born, eternal adversaries of the Ungods.
	The cirrus, as the first denizens of Tanares to wield magic, taught other species the gods' will and the potency of arcane arts after the initial Ungod invasion. Guided by Zafara, a revered elder, the cirrus significantly contributed to the ascension of the Malrokian Kingdom, endorsing its quest for unity and prosperity. Yet the Ungods' insidious corruption infiltrated the kingdom's heart, heedless of the cirrus' dire warnings. The blind nobility instigated a catastrophic war, inflicting untold suffering upon their people, empowering the Ungods, and ultimately unleashing a cataclysm that fractured the continent and nearly eradicated all civilizations. The cirrus were unjustly vilified for the kingdom's demise, their mastery of arcane magic twisted into a malevolent force responsible for the Malrokian Curse. Persecuted and exiled, the cirrus retreated to distant mountains, vowing to avoid further strife.
	As the mournful shroud of the Fallen and Imperial Ages covered the world, the cirrus withdrew into isolation, refining their knowledge and abilities within their hidden sanctuaries. When the Kemet Invasion threatened to unravel the fabric of their world, they emerged from seclusion, wielding their arcane and divine prowess as a bastion against encroaching darkness. The cirrus fought with valor, striving to avert an other Malrokian Curse that could obliterate their world.
	In the present age, the cirrus serve as enigmatic and formidable guardians, their unwavering devotion to their celestial mission shaping their actions. Amidst a world teetering on the brink of ruin, they symbolize virtue and chivalry, resolute protectors against the relentless threat of the Ungods.
	The seven Zephyr Knight Orders epitomize the cirrus species, their distinct virtues and combat techniques bolstering their collective might. Complex webs of loyalty, rivalry, and collaboration interlace a vibrant tapestry of unity among them. Their enduring faith in the gods, coupled with an ancient mastery of both arcane and divine magic, readied the Cirrus to confront the omnipresent darkness. United in their celestial purpose and unyielding in their commitment, they stand vigilant to safeguard the fragile balance of their world. Shaped by divine will and hardened by adversity, the cirrus bear the undeserved stigma of their people, distrusted by many, even as they valiantly defend the mortal realms from the insidious corruption of the Ungods.</text>

      <name>The First Spellcasters</name>
      <text>Throughout the annals of history, the cirrus have distin guished themselves as the first mortals to pray for the gods, and the earliest scholars to unearth the secrets of wizardry. They seamlessly interlaced magic into the essence of their civilization, forging a society where the might of arcane arts and divine power is entwined with their chivalrous way of life.
	Renowned for their mastery of all forms of magic and their unyielding determination to obliterate the Ungods and their nefarious servants, the cirrus strive to pierce the enigmatic Tanarean Magic Field. They believe that this untamed and raw power holds the key to vanquishing the Ungods once and for all. While many other species consider this a great taboo, for the gods themselves established the Tanaren Magic Field, no condemnation has ever deterred the cirrus from pursuing their belief in this divine mandate to find ultimate magic power.
	The chivalric orders of the cirrus exemplify their ingenious and diverse mastery of magic. Each order embodies a unique fusion of virtues and magical expertise, reflecting the rich complexity of cirrus society. Orders bearing black banners excel in arcane spellcasting, while those with white banners champion divine spells. As per time-honored tradition, every cirrus is expected to join one of these orders upon reaching adulthood, undergoing rigorous training as squires before ascending to the esteemed ranks of knights. Though most embrace the path of spellcasting, not all choose this calling; many cirrus adeptly balance their magical prowess with formidable physical combat skills.
	Magic is woven into the very fabric of cirrus culture, molding their society and their relentless battle against the Ungods. Their insatiable thirst for arcane knowledge and divine wisdom has led them to craft potent rituals, capable of decimating their foes and shielding their people. The cirrus' groundbreaking utilization of magic has bestowed upon them a distinct advantage in their ongoing conflict against the Ungods, and their unyielding determination to unravel the enigma of the Tanarean Magic Field bears witness to their unrelenting pursuit of ultimate triumph.
	As a species that has constructed its very existence upon the foundation of magic, the cirrus exemplifies the limitless potential of arcane and divine power.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Sharing A Body</name>
      <text>The two forms of a cirrus are unique, each considering the other form as another part of their being. For a cirrus, it is so natural to share two forms that they find it strange that individuals of other species are always the same person. 

	• A cirrus always treats their other form as a distinct person, and it is common to hear them say things like "Oh, Torrus did that again?" or "This is something that Arven would love to see."

	• A cirrus is aware of their short time in each form and makes the most of the time before the other form takes over. 

	• Cirrus remember the day lived by the other form as if they had seen the situations in the third person, as mere spectators of the other's life. That's why many of them like to talk to the other form out loud so that the other form can hear them. If they prefer to be discreet, they write a note or something similar. 

	• It is quite common for the two forms to have different functions and responsibilities, understanding that each is, in fact, a different being. Generally, one form of cirrus does not take responsibility for the actions of the other form, as they consider themselves unique beings, and sometimes they disagree with each other's decisions, al though they often agree on some things that require their body to commit daily, such as adventuring in a group or belonging to a team. 

	• The sense of urgency is common among cirrus, as they know that their actions must be limited to a single day. They are generally respectful and have a lot of love for one form to the other, despite the enormous differences, because they understand that they are codependent.</text>

      <name>Two In One</name>
      <text>When creating a cirrus, you must create two distinct character sheets, one representing your Tamerian side and another representing your Bauronean side. Throughout a day, you will use only one of these character sheets, keeping the other stored, and you must switch to the other immediately after the first long rest performed in a 24-hour period (counted from the time the last long rest where you changed your character sheet began). Both character sheets have the same amount of experience, ensuring they will always have the same character level. The benefits granted by a long rest will apply to the character sheet that will assume control after it is performed. Magic items attuned to one side will not be attuned to the other. Some effects will apply to both character sheets, regardless of their origin. They are:

	• Effects with a duration counted in days; 
	• Effects that cause loss of a limb, such as a hand or arm, for example; 
	• Curses or any effects related to the soul; 
	• Levels of exhaustion. If a level of exhaustion is gained or lost by one character sheet, it will be gained or lost equally in the other; and

      <text>Poisonous scorpid-elves with penumbral roots, these brothers and sisters thrive as defiant survivors valuing hive loyalty and personal liberty. Their unorthodox, resourceful spirit embodies an anarchic, do-it-yourself ethos.

"Hey there, stranger! You've followed the echoes of our drums to our hive, huh? No need for airs and graces here, just our steadfast spirit and unity. We've survived the blackest of night mares and emerged stronger, claiming the freedom to be our authentic selves. Our bold tattoos narrate our lives, and our music thunders in sync with the hive's pulse.
	Join us in the shadows, and you'll see we're pros at navigating these treacherous depths. We stalk the wicked beings that haunted our past, avenging our kin and shielding the world from the Penumbral Plane's horrors. We don't kneel to gods; our rituals are what bind and nourish us, forging unbreak able connections. Earn our trust, and we'll be by your side in battle and beyond, fighting 'til our final breath. But remember, if you stab us in the back, the shadows themselves will turn against you. So, are you prepared to face the darkness with us?"
- Vyxendrak-rar, leader of the Invisible Patrol Hive.

Beneath the vast continent of Tanares lies the shadowy, subterranean realm of the Undertanares, where the resilient and ferocious gloomfolks dwell. Once winter elves, these beings met a dark fate in the eerie Penumbral Plane, a realm tainted by corruption and shadows. Captured and enslaved by the Cult of Shadow Wing, the winter elves were subjected to horrific experiments under Bellara, the Daughter of the Ungods. Seeking to create a new hybrid of mortal creatures and penumbral aberrations for her army, she transformed them into fearsome, scorpion-like creatures.
	The gloomfolk's striking appearance blends elven beauty with scorpid terror. Their upper bodies exhibit the elegant features of their winter elven heritage, while chitinous shells of onyx hues extend from their waists, forming scorpion-like lower halves with vicious pincers and a venomous stinger. Embracing personal expression and rejecting traditional conformity, they don vivid, bold clothes, studded leather jackets, tribal tattoos, iron chains and ragged, comfortable clothing. To them, attire is a means of expressing their individuality, rather than impressing others or signifying status.
	Nestled within the Undertanares' tunnels and caverns, the gloomfolks form tight-knit communities in their hives, celebrating effort, personal talents, independence, and self-sufficiency. Their deep loyalty to their hive binds them together, while their culture challenges societal norms, rarely respecting institutions or authority figures. This stems from their oppressed past, which birthed a deep passion for freedom and a profound distrust of authority and control. Their society eschews propriety; everything belongs to the hive, not individuals, and they reject materialism, embracing alternative lifestyles and artistic expressions that deviate from the norm. Their indomitable spirit is reflected in their love for loud, fast-paced, and aggressive music, featuring powerful drums and shouting vocals.
	Organized into various roles, gloomfolk society includes crafters, hunters, guardians, child-carers, elders, cultivators, mystics, and scouts. Each member plays a vital role in their communal existence, free to change occupations as their desires and knowledge evolve. They prefer creative pursuits and self-reliance over dependence on others. While they welcome other species into their hives, trust must be earned, and treason is the gravest taboo, met with the harshest consequences.
	United in their unique culture, the gloomfolk support and uplift one another, embodying freedom and an indomitable will to survive, even amidst darkness and horror. Their keen reflexes and survival instincts were honed during their enslavement in the Penumbral Plane, under the cruel Cult of Shadow Wing. This experience shaped their unapologetic attitude, strong and independent demeanor, and willingness to confront challenges head-on. Now liberated, their hearts burn with the desire to survive, to thrive, and to take revenge on those who enslaved and twisted them into the fearsome beings they are today.

      <name>Gloomfolk History</name>
      <text>The history of the gloomfolk is a tale of sorrow, transfor mation, and determination. Over three millennia ago, the winter elves sought ways to combat the corruptive influence of the Ungods in Tanares. They studied penumbral energy and ventured into shadowy realms to uncover their enemies' secrets.
	Unfortunately, this journey led many winter elves into the clutches of the sinister Queen Bellara and her arachne minions. These elves were transformed into scorpion-like beings and enslaved by her and the Cult of Shadow Wing for countless centuries.
	In time, the gloomfolks, as they came to be known, formed a society centered around community, survival, and avenging their kin. Their unique culture was shaped by their trans formed bodies and subterranean lifestyles.
	When the sinister Queen Bellara was captured by Malrok, a human hero, the gloomfolk saw a chance for freedom. Under the guidance of a legendary unnamed leader called the Patriarch, they gathered intelligence, crafted weapons, and developed a potent poison to use against their captors. The Patriarch's ingenious traps and strategies led some to speculate that he might have been a deity in disguise, though most gloomfolk dismiss this idea.
	With the Patriarch's help, the gloomfolk staged an uprising, freeing themselves from the cult's grasp and emerging from the Penumbra. They found sanctuary in the subterranean realms of Undertanares, where they formed hives and adapted to their new forms well suited to darkness. Nestled within the labyrinthine tunnels, the gloomfolk nurtured an unwavering loyalty to their hives, erecting them upon the sheer faces of fathomless chasms to deter hostile beings. They forged alliances with the dwarves, and even some goblinoid tribes, while interacting little with the surface dwellers as they were engaged in fierce combat against the Shadow Wing cultists, who unleashed a myriad of monstrous creatures and penumbral rifts throughout Undertanares.
	To further their hunting, the gloomfolks also established hives within the Penumbral Plane itself, using arcane pylons devised by the Draconic Council to create sanctuaries protecting their villages. To this day they continue to explore un charted underground realms and venture into the Penumbral Plane, seeking vengeance against the Ungods searching long-forgotten secrets that can help them in their quest. Their ultimate goal is to end Bellara and avenge their kin.</text>

      <name>Hunters of Penumbral Creatures</name>
      <text>Empowered by the cruel experiments imposed upon them by Bellara and the Cult of Shadow Wing, the gloomfolk now wield their formidable abilities to combat their former op pressors. For generations, these vengeful souls have honed their hunting prowess, relentlessly preying on the malevolent forces that once enslaved them.
	During their captivity, the gloomfolk were forced to scrape for food, often resorting to consuming the remains of dead penumbral creatures. This desperate act, combined with the corruptive magic that twisted their bodies, not only allowed them to withstand, but also to gain strength from the flesh of these aberrations. To the gloomfolk, feasting on penumbral creatures is both a delicious meal and a potent symbol of retribution.
	The gloomfolk's distinct ability to feed on these creatures has profoundly influenced their culture and traditions, offering unparalleled sustenance compared to ordinary food sources. This nourishment not only fuels their desire for vengeance but also ensures the growth and fortitude of their offspring. While adult gloomfolk can subsist on conventional fare, their young must ingest the flesh of penumbral beings to achieve their full potential. Their aberrant, scorpion-like forms have an inherent craving for the power harbored within the tainted flesh. Failure to provide the proper nourishment may result in the young growing smaller, weaker, and lacking the resilience to corruption that characterizes the gloomfolk.
	As they need to hunt penumbral creatures to feed their hives, they have mastered the skills of hunting and subterfuge. The gloomfolk stalk their prey through the treacherous tunnels of Undertanares and the sinister layers of the Penumbral Plane with lethal accuracy. Their innate understanding of darkness and ability to navigate challenging terrain grant them an invaluable edge, enabling them to exploit their surroundings to devastating effect.
	Equipped with venomous stingers and robust chitin exoskeletons, the gloomfolk's scorpion-like forms are perfectly adapted for hunting penumbral creatures and aberrations. The toxin they initially developed during their escape plans is still crafted and employed by them, utilizing their innate venom as a crucial ingredient. Impressively, this poison demonstrates efficacy against even the Ungods' spawn that are immune to all other toxins. This ingenious weapon, which played a pivotal role in their emancipation, continues to be vital in their relentless battle against the Ungods and the Cult of Shadow Wing.
	Employing cunning traps, hit-and-run tactics, powerful poisons, and their knowledge of the Penumbral Plane, the gloomfolk have become formidable hunters, continuously weakening the forces of the Ungods. They bring down even the most fearsome foes and serve as valuable allies to all those seeking to eradicate corruption from the world.</text>

      <name>The Hives and the Gloomfolk Society</name>
      <text>At the heart of gloomfolk society thrives the concept of hives, where each individual is cherished for their unique talents and contributions. The absence of hierarchy cultivates an atmosphere of freedom, empowering members to explore and adapt roles in harmony with their desires and expertise. This structure nurtures a potent sense of community, fostering collaboration, mutual support, and shared responsibility among its members.
	Intricate tribal tattoo markings hold immense significance within gloomfolk society. These elaborate patterns symbol ize each individual's hive and skills, allowing gloomfolk to effortlessly recognize one another and swiftly discern their strengths and capabilities. The markings also serve as a canvas for personal expression, reflecting the personality and dis tinct style of each gloomfolk. As individuals embark on their chosen paths, their tattoos evolve to embody their growth, experiences, and triumphs, weaving an evolving and fluid representation of their life's journey.
	Nestled at the core of every hive rests the sacred Hive Stone, a meticulously crafted bauronite stone infused with the blood of all who join the hive, be they newborns or later joiners. This revered object embodies unity, continuity, and shared history among the gloomfolk. As a hive member passes on, their blood is mingled with the stone, entwining their memory and essence into the eternal history of the hive.
	The esteemed elders of the gloomfolk possess a singular connection to the Hive Stone. By merely touching the stone, they can access the memories of all departed hive members, preserving the community's collective wisdom and bestowing it upon future generations. This extraordinary bond between the elders and the Hive Stone instills a deep sense of reverence and duty, with gloomfolk resolute in their willingness to lay down their lives to protect this sacred object.
	Within the embrace of their hives, the gloomfolk forge a profound sense of belonging and interconnectedness. They draw strength from the knowledge and experiences of their ancestors, as well as the unyielding bonds that unite them with their fellow hive members, crafting a resilient and vi brant society. Adventurers seeking to learn the secrets of the Penumbral Plane may find the gloomfolk's knowledge and skills invaluable.</text>

      <name>The Gloomfolk Rituals</name>
      <text>While the gloomfolk lack a formal religion, as their centu ries of suffering caused them to distrust divine protection and worshiping, they have developed many rituals centered on their hives. Most of them are said to be devised by the Patriarch and passed to the first hives; they all celebrate their brotherhood, freedom and their quest to avenge their kin. The four grand rituals are: the Ritual of Initiation, Ritual of Eldermantle, The Return to Shadows, and the Vengeance Day.
	The Ritual of Initiation is performed annually for children reaching adulthood, or to add new members to the hive. The young gloomfolks must complete their first unassisted hunt as a hive without adult intervention. The ritual celebrates the gloomfolk freedom from the Cult of Shadow Wing and their triumph over the penumbral forces.
	The Ritual of Eldermantle is a rite in which a gloomfolk is acknowledged as an elder, their wisdom recognized by the hive. A special marking is added to their tattoos by an other elder, symbolizing wisdom and their most impressive personal feat or trait. Only those who have demonstrated wisdom or great deeds are granted this honor. Those who receive this are able to access the memories of all previous hive members on the Hive Stone.
	The Return to Shadows is a funeral rite observed by the gloomfolk to honor and mourn the passing of one of their kin. In this ceremony, after infusing its blood into the Hive Stone, each member of the hive etches a small portion of the deceased's tattoos onto their own body, thereby preserving the memory and legacy of the departed. If the gloomfolk's death is deemed unjust, the hive pledges to avenge their loss. This rite is carried out even in the absence of a body, as hive members who remember the deceased's tattoo patterns can still engrave the designs onto others. This act of collective remembrance is the most significant aspect of the Return to Shadows ritual.
	The Vengeance Day is a bloody ritual enacted when a hive member betrays the tribe. Each member scars their own body with a pattern representing the offender, symbolizing the enduring wound of their betrayal. A blood hunt is declared against the traitor, and the hive will stop at nothing to bring them to justice. The elders use the Hive Stone and employ ritual magic to help track the traitor, guiding the hive to find and kill the betrayer.</text>

      <text>Reborn with past-life memories and cultural knowledge, the soulborns are expert traders and diplomats, rich in wealth and wisdom from their many lifetimes.

"What's that? Do you sense a familiar aura in the air? I know that feeling all too well. It's a common experience for us soul born, as we are carriers of the memories of all our past lives. Your intuition is right, my friend. You have been here before, although not in this lifetime. It's time for us to delve into the mysteries of your past lives and find the connection that led you here. So let's begin, shall we?"
- Octavius Hadrian Magnus Ulf Leofric Theron Hiroto Aelarion Valtarius Thorid of Hajal

In the realm of Tanares, a rare and remarkable phenomenon gives rise to the soulborn, a people who defy the boundaries of species and culture. These extraordinary beings are born with the soul of a soulborn, reincarnated into the bodies of newborns from various species. Their distinct appearance, marked by gray skin and white, curly hair, sets them apart from their biological kin. These physical alterations stem from the power of their unique souls, a trait not inherited by their offspring, as any child of a soulborn will be born as a normal member of their parents' biological species.
	The genesis of the soulborn traces back to the kemets, a sect of winter elves obsessed with regaining their lost immortality. Their unrelenting pursuit of ancient Kepesh artifacts and rituals led them to a mysterious artifact connected to Ba-Ka, the enigmatic spirit god. In a desperate attempt to seize the artifact, the kemets unleashed a calamitous magical event. The cataclysm annihilated their physical forms but imbued their souls with an unprecedented quality, giving birth to the first soulborn.
	As these newly-formed soulborn reincarnated into different species across Tanares, their souls carried the memories and accomplishments of their past lives. As they mature in their current forms, they regain access to their ancient memories, deepening their connection to their former selves and drawing upon the wisdom of ages.
	Soulborn children display an extraordinary precocity, mastering the art of walking and speaking far earlier than their contemporaries. Though initially obscured, their memories of past lives slowly crystallize as they mature, melding seamlessly with their soul's recollections. This amalgamation of old and new identities fosters a profound comprehension of myriad cultures, enabling them to savor each experience in its entirety.
	These memories initially manifest in dreams, gradually coalescing within the soulborn's consciousness as they re gain fragments of their past over time. Occasionally, intense emotional situations or the presence of certain objects may provoke the retrieval of these lost memory shards. But otherwise, it is a slow and continuous process.
	Throughout countless lives, the soulborn have woven themselves into the tapestry of Tanares' diverse cultures and species.

      <name>Soulborn History</name>
      <text>The soulborn's saga is a tale of ambition, transformation, and an unyielding quest for purpose. Rising from the ashes of the Fallen Age after the collapse of the Malrokian Kingdom, the soulborn emerged from a cataclysmic magical event on the enigmatic continent of Darkall. Their origins lie with the kemets, winter elves who pursued a prophecy with fervent zeal.
	In the shadows of the first Malrokian Curse, the kemets waged war against the Kepesh people on the Darkall continent. Fearing another devastating Curse event, the kemets advanced with calculated patience. Amidst the conflict, a faction of kemets, obsessed with reclaiming the elven lost immortality, uncovered an ancient pyramid housing a sacred artifact of the Kepesh spirit god, Ba-Ka.
	The kemet's assault on the site was ill-timed, and chaos ensued as they disrupted a Kepesh ritual at the worst pos sible moment. The unleashed magical forces incinerated all present; Ba-Ka granted his followers' souls passage to his ethereal domain, but not to the kemets. The forsaken kemet souls were imbued with the magic of the artifact's shards, bestowing upon them the unique and unexpected ability to reincarnate, thus giving birth to the soulborn. Although the ritual took place in Darkall, soulborns began to be born anywhere in the world.
	The newly-formed soulborn reincarnated into various species across Tanares, creating a unique comprehension of the world that grew more complex and deep with each incarnation. With the knowledge, prestige, and wealth they amassed, they established influential institutions, including the Bank of Hajal, Tanares' most powerful financial establishment.
	Being born as sons and daughters of other species caused a great initial uproar in Tanares' different societies. Each one reacted in unique ways. The humans of the Capital saw them as souls touched by corruption, not able to become angels in the Tamera and Bauron hosts. For civilizations further away from the Evolutionist Church dogmas they were considered blessed children. The dwarves saw them as blessed at first, but later, after discovering their past, many shunned them as not true dwarves. The taii'maku saw them as a positive force to further the wisdom of their society, treating them normally as one of their own. Thus far, there are no known instances of a soulborn being born among the elven species. Many speculate that this may be due to a curse from Ba-Ka. Besides that, they adapted to their new existences well, and kept searching for a new meaning for their lives.
	During the Kemet Invasion, the soulborns sent all the financial aid they could muster to help combat the invaders, having long since severed their ties to the kemet identity. The first construction of Wharfugee was done with soulborn resources, the city that would be called Heroes Rise after the war. While few of the soulborn joined the battle physically, many were behind the scenes aiding the heroes' efforts. One of the few who joined the fray was Azmodhar, a soulborn historian and scholar who helped the heroes uncover secrets about the kemets' past and their plans.
	After the invasion, with the world fragmented in a cold war, most soulborns chose to maintain neutrality. However, individual soulborns can be found aligned with all different sides of the current conflicts, each pursuing their person al agendas. Motivations range from the pursuit of wealth and power to the protection of their families, businesses, or personal values. Unbeknownst to many, a great number of soulborns continue to support the descendants of their previous lives, making them, as a whole, strongly opposed to war or an escalation of conflict.
	Soulborns, as a collective, are currently focusing their efforts on preventing conflict among Tanares' divided factions. Their neutrality allows them to flourish in the midst of chaos. Although not as fervently dedicated to opposing the Ungods as other species, the soulborn remain mindful of the threat they pose. This is due, in part, to the fact that their own souls cannot be transformed into penumbral creatures upon death.
	Instead, soulborns prioritize the accumulation of wealth and power, as well as securing societal acceptance. Nevertheless, they are more than willing to finance initiatives and operations against the Ungods, fortifying defenses to stave off these sinister beings. By doing so, they indirectly contribute to the greater struggle against the dark forces that plague the land.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Unique Souls Persecuted 
by the Ungods</name>
      <text>Unlike other souls that ascend to celestial heights or descend as penumbral creatures, the soulborn are trapped in an eternal cycle of rebirth. This strange peculiarity both shapes their destinies and fuels debates over whether their fate is a curse or divine providence.
	The reformed Celestianist Church, having cast aside the twisted belief that soulborn were inherently corrupted, now regards them as potential allies against the Ungods. The soul born's inability to be transformed into penumbral abominations is seen as their greatest blessing.
	As their souls continuously reincarnate, the soulborn gain unique perspectives on faith, either unwaveringly devoted to a single religion or exploring myriad of beliefs, ultimately becoming invaluable scholarly assets. Regrettably, their sin gular existence makes them prime targets for the insidious Ungods, who covet immortal cultists capable of infiltrating societies and spreading corruption.
	Soulborn sometimes are abducted and forced into conversion, yet their loyalty falters in subsequent lives. Instead, the Ungods prefer to manipulate the desires and needs of the soulborn, luring them into willful servitude with promises of prosperity in future incarnations.
	This treacherous possibility is known only to scholars and the powerful, but still it breeds distrust toward the soulborn. Unblemished soulborn strive to prove their loyalty by fighting the Cult of Shadow Wing, but their efforts are often in vain, as corrupted soulborn masquerade under the same guise. Nevertheless, they persist, for failure would render them undeniably suspect.
	Aware of the soulborn's immense influence and global connections, the Ungods seek to corrupt or undermine them, knowing that doing so would weaken mortal resistance. Determined to defy this fate, the soulborn use their wealth for the betterment of society, becoming indispensable pillars of commerce, finance, and diplomacy, to prove their worth to their community. But by doing so they place themselves in positions of great importance in the backstages of society. Their disappearance would spell catastrophe, aligning perfectly with the Ungods' nefarious desires.
	Ultimately, the soulborn are more often victims of the Ungods' unyielding persecution than active opponents. Beset by the Ungods, public distrust, and prejudice, they nevertheless persevere, emerging as influential puppeteers in Tanares. Their penchant for operating in the shadows is born of their precarious existence, masterfully managing resources from the background with unparalleled efficacy.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Family and Business</name>
      <text>Soulborns traverse multiple lives, amassing an array of experiences that span diverse cultures and species. This unique heritage renders them exceptional ambassadors and representatives for commerce, their connections and insights facilitating the establishment of guilds, shops, and enterprises. Their preference for long-term investments reflects their foresight, ensuring returns in future lives.
	Soulborns form unique family dynamics due to their eternal nature. Their children, born from the species of their current biological parents, lack the immortality of their soulborn parent. Consequently, soulborns cherish their offspring, aware of their vulnerability and single lifespan. These eternal beings are fiercely devoted to their families, willing to take immense risks to protect and give a good life to them, conscious that their loved ones have just one life to live.
	As soulborns accumulate new relationships and wealth across lives, they display varying attitudes toward their assets. Good-aligned soulborns prioritize family security, leaving substantial inheritance for their loved ones and relying on their ability to rebuild wealth in future lives. Some egoistic or evil-aligned soulborns may hoard their resources, ensuring opulence in their next incarnation while leaving their families with lesser parts of their wealth after their deaths.
	Soulborns often maintain a low profile, interacting with high-ranking individuals and attending high-class festivities discreetly. They take pleasure in the finest food, drink, and accommodations, having developed refined tastes across their many lives. However, they remain adaptable, as many have experienced hardships in past lives.
	Soulborns might favor descendants from previous lives, finding joy in observing their grandchildren or grand-grand children. However, their primary focus generally remains on their current family. Descendants from prior lives sometimes seek out their soulborn ancestors to uncover family history or plead for wealth, but the later pursuits can be met with resistance, as soulborns often find this disrespectful.
	As patrons of adventuring companies and mercenary groups, soulborns wield considerable influence in Tanares' political conflicts. Adventurers may become entangled in a web of intrigue, navigating the interests of their soulborn benefactors alongside their own goals. As adventurers them selves, they are less afraid of death, as they know they will be reborn, yet they are not inconsequential. They also form cohesive bonds with various allies, their unique perspective binding diverse groups together on their quests for ancient objects of their past and a better future for their next lives.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Ancient Relics of Past Lives</name>
      <text>Compelled to preserve and reconnect with their former lives, soulborns often invest in museums, antiquaries, and expeditions to uncover relics that serve as both invaluable anchors and conduits of wisdom between their existences.
	Though not always art connoisseurs, soulborns are driven to assemble collections that honor their past lives, with a particular fondness for portraits of themselves and their families. In each incarnation, they commission the most skilled artists to craft these cherished heirlooms, ensuring their legacy endures through the ages.
	The soulborns' affinity for relics transcends mere personal interest; they often become esteemed scholars, historians, and curators of prestigious museums. By financing archaeological expeditions and engaging adventurers or mercenaries to delve into perilous ruins, they unearth long-lost treasures and cultural artifacts from the very epochs they once inhabited.
	Embracing their role as custodians of history, many soulborns join the ranks of the Relic Hunters Guild, banding together in their quest to reclaim the remnants of the past. As they traverse ancient landscapes, they relish the opportunity to witness the echoes of their past firsthand, even venturing into danger to see again the scenarios they saw in their previous lives, often using the support of hired guards or esteemed companions.
	Soulborns stand as eternal witnesses to the ever-shifting world of Tanares, weaving together the threads of time as they preserve and honor the vestiges of their many lives.</text>

      <text>Standing tall and robust, the taii'maku are pacifist intellectuals who favor logic over emotions. They excel in math and engineering, creating remarkable inventions.

"Cough... cough... excuse me. I'll put my pipe aside. Well, as I was saying, think of the world as a big structure full of intertwined gears, activated by the correct operation of levers. Therefore, if a part is defective, or if the synchronization is out of rhythm, the entire structure can be affected, generating a chain collapse. In this way, we must be quick and precise to detect which parts need maintenance or replacement, so that the movement is adequately preserved. I hope you don't mind the extra detail, I tend to get carried away with my explanations."
- U'Tibam, the most brilliant mind of Tanar

The taii'maku, a majestic and enigmatic species, exude an aura of reverence and admiration that leaves a lasting impression upon those who cross their path. Towering figures with sinewy builds and earth-toned complexions, their most captivating feature lies within their fascinating, luminous white eyes, which seem to radiate boundless intelligence and curiosity. A signature trait of the taii'maku is their near-absence of emotion, cultivated through meditation and adherence to a philosophy steeped in logic, enabling them to maintain a serene, respectful, and stoic demeanor, even in the most dire of circumstances.
	Possessing a keen, logic-driven intellect, the taii'maku prioritize rationality in their daily lives, exhibiting remarkable prowess in engineering and mathematics. They frequently categorize decisions as either "logical" or "illogical" when evaluating situations and determining their course of action. Even their spellcasters perceive magic as sophisticated formulas and complex equations, employing this knowledge to forge exceptional mechanical golems and constructs. The taii'maku's legendary mobile cities, known as Illus, are powered by the arcane energies harnessed from bauronite ores, epitomizing their unparalleled mastery in harmonizing magic and technology to birth utopian wonders.
	As a nomadic society, the taii'maku are in perpetual motion, ceaselessly seeking new resources and knowledge, while refining theories in mathematics, physics, magic, and the fabric of the cosmos. They hold libraries and educational institutions in the highest esteem, embodying their devotion to the pursuit and dissemination of knowledge.
	This mindset, however, can render the taii'maku ill equipped to comprehend or participate in humor. Some may take jests literally or fail to recognize them as such, while others may attempt humor without the inherent flair for it, resulting in contrived or ill-timed jokes that provoke laughter at their own expense, rather than shared mirth.
	Their polite and pacifist way make them easy to coexist with other species, but their lack of emotions and rational minds may inadvertently offend or alarm others. Elves and dwarves, particularly those who have lived longer, tend to share a more detached perspective on life, resonating with the taii'maku, while halflings, humans, and gloomfolk may perceive the taii'maku as arrogant or even immoral when they present unemotional and logical courses of action.
	The taii'maku approach the world through a practical and unvarnished lens, perceiving everything, including society itself, as a machine where each component must function harmoniously. They often endeavor to "fix" individuals through education, much like mending machines, structures, or other malfunctioning systems. While their precision and efficiency are indeed commendable, their stoic demeanor, emotional detachment, and impassive expressions can occasionally lead to miscommunication with other species.

      <name>Taii'maku History</name>
      <text>Born during the Godly Age, the brilliant taii'maku species emerged from the wills of Tamera and Bauron as a species created to bring progress and harmony, so they could extend this benevolence to all living beings.
	As a nomadic people, the taii'maku cleverly avoided conflict by employing their extraordinary engineering prowess and bauronite extraction methods to construct the Illus, their magnificent mobile cities. This enabled them to relocate continuously, evading disputes with neighboring species.
	When the Ungods first attacked, the taii'maku focused on protecting their people and providing refuge to others. They employed sophisticated magical constructs to fend off the relentless onslaught. However, the Ungods released the kikokus, sinister insectoid creatures capable of corrupting and controlling the taii'maku's constructs. Although the taii'maku eventually repelled the kikokus, the victory came at the cost of thousands of their lives.
	In the wake of this conflict, the taii'maku formed an alliance with humans, establishing the Malrokian Kingdom under King Malrok's vision of peaceful unity. They innovated the concept of nonviolent dispute resolution through athletic competition in specially designed arenas. Regrettably, this noble idea was later corrupted by the Tanarean Empire.
	The Cult of Shadow Wing infiltrated the Malrokian nobility, forcing the taii'maku to confront the tainted aristocracy. The nobles' greed and refusal to heed taii'maku advice culminated in the Malrokian Curse—a disaster that nearly destroyed the world. Disillusioned, the taii'maku withdrew to their Illus, seeking solace in knowledge and solitude.
	During the Imperial Age, Emperor Baleroth attempted to gain access to the taii'maku's magical and engineering expertise but was met with resistance. This covert persecution only exacerbated their isolationist tendencies and mistrust of other species.
	The Kemet Invasion marked a turning point. The Illus endured relentless assaults, and Tanares heroes and taii'maku champions provided crucial support. This siege exposed the dangers of isolation, prompting taii'maku heroes to persuade their people to reconnect and exchange knowledge with other species. Gradually, the Illus reintegrated into a broader network of commerce and intellectual collaboration.
	Today, the taii'maku navigate the intricate politics of the realms, striving to protect their secrets and uphold their values. Some Illus remain independent, while others form alliances or openly support factions. Many have joined the Allied Forces, exploring new strategies to fight the Ungods.
	Although they yearn for cooperative endeavors, the taii'maku encounter challenges from unpredictable behavior and conflicting agendas among various factions. Their councils maintain vigilance against espionage and deceit, working to safeguard taii'maku secrets. Despite these hurdles, they persist in strengthening their repositories of knowledge.
	In recent times, the taii'maku have assisted in developing infrastructure across numerous human cities, particularly within the Republic and the Tanarean Empire. Their excep tional construction and engineering expertise have vastly improved the quality of life in these regions. They have al so established a nuanced relationship with the Magocracy of Mage Tower, engaging in lively debates and exchanging wisdom with their mages. However, the taii'maku remain wary, expressing concerns about the ethical implications of certain experiments conducted by the Magocracy.</text>

      <name>Contributing to a Better World</name>
      <text>The taii'maku stand in Tanares as architects of progress, tirelessly striving to forge a harmonious existence for all inhabitants. Their commitment to innovation and progress has given rise to astonishing constructs that seamlessly perform tasks, ensuring transportation, security, and unwavering support in their quest for an idyllic society.
	Masters of their craft, the taii'maku have achieved seemingly impossible feats: quenching the parched desert with life-giving water, taming the fury of unyielding floods, and constructing sophisticated sanitation systems. Their ingenious roadways bridge the gaps between cities and kingdoms, fostering unity and cooperation in the face of adversity.
	Taii'maku cities serve as radiant beacons of their grand vision, with constructs assuming the mantle of manual labor, allowing the citizens to immerse themselves in contemplation, research, and personal growth. Massive mechanical wagons and swift-flying vessels transport people with ease, while constructs dutifully cater to every conceivable task.
	In their pursuit of a brighter future, the taii'maku remain ever vigilant against the persistent menace of the kikoku. With unwavering resolve, they thwart these sinister creatures' attempts to reproduce and breach their resplendent cities.
	The taii'maku wield wisdom and reason as formidable weapons, serving as advisors and guides in a world beset by strife and corruption. Their most gifted strategists and thinkers labor tirelessly to craft intricate plans and tactics to counter the insidious influence of the Ungods, extending aid and warnings to other realms, even when their words fall on deaf ears.
	Through their steadfast dedication to logic and unyielding resistance to the vices and temptations of the Ungods, the taii'maku emerge as a formidable adversary in the battle against malevolent forces. Their very existence presents a challenge that the Ungods are all too eager to eliminate, yet the taii'maku remain undeterred, resolute in their mission to unite and uplift the denizens of Tanares.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Taii'maku Society</name>
      <text>In the heart of the taii'maku civilization, a steadfast dedication to logic, rationality, and the pursuit of knowledge beats like a resonant drum. Eschewing traditional faith in deities, they perceive gods as highly evolved entities, masters of profound wisdom and comprehension of reality. Within their ranks, clerics and paladins exist, but they view them selves as emissaries of superior wisdom rather than servants of a divine being.
	The essence of taii'maku culture lies in order and balance, reflected by their harmonious, symmetrical, and geometric city architecture. Crafted with meticulous accuracy, their urban landscapes optimize mystical energy efficiency and resource management. Their cuisine, mirroring their methodical nature, emphasizes objectivity and efficiency over taste and presentation, crafting meals that deliver optimal health and nutrient intake.
	In their relationships, the taii'maku exhibit an extraordinary form of empathy. Devoid of emotional experience, it stems from understanding the logical and practical needs of others. Their ethical framework originates from a deep thought experiment in which they shed all knowledge of
	identity, status, and personal circumstances to impartially inhabit the lives of every individual. This process allows them to grasp the needs and perspectives of all beings, forging an ethical rule that is equitable and just for all. Such an approach is vital for the taii'maku to create a society that caters to everyone's needs without succumbing to oppression or tyranny.
	In pursuit of this ideal, they strive for a harmonious societal balance, ensuring the well-being of all without sacrificing the few. Every voice is heard and respected, fostering unity and shared understanding.
	Marriage in taii'maku society is deemed a logical obligation and lifelong commitment. Couples are selected based on intellectual compatibility and the potential to counter balance each other's weaknesses, resulting in partners with vastly different skill sets. When raising children, taii'maku parents display a profound sense of responsibility, attentive ness, and devotion, particularly in education and imparting wisdom. However, their parenting approach lacks the emotional warmth observed in other species.
	Society is structured around a knowledge-based hierarchy, with an individual's status determined by their contributions to collective wisdom. Their economy revolves around trading knowledge and bauronite ore, prioritizing the exchange of information, discoveries, ideas, and components for crafts and research over traditional gold coins. This system nurtures a culture of perpetual learning and innovation.
	Taii'maku governance is anchored in public councils led by the eldest members, inviting anyone with a contribution to engage in discussions. Decisions are made through vot ing, emphasizing logic over personal biases and frequently resulting in unanimous or near-unanimous outcomes, as they discuss until every individual is satisfied.
	The deep Taii'maku language, comprised of intricate symbols and exact mathematical forms, enables efficient and meticulous idea exchanges, unparalleled in Tanares. In leisure, they partake in intellectual debates, exchanging logical arguments to persuade their audience, or team sports that demand exceptional coordination and tactics.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Math, Engineering, and Constructs</name>
      <text>Within the great halls of the taii'maku civilization, an un paralleled mastery of mathematics, engineering, and magic reverberates through every aspect of their intricate culture. This extraordinary fusion breathes life into a myriad of con structs, each pulsating with the volatile yet potent mystical energies of bauronite.
	Highly advanced constructs serve as the lifeblood of taii'maku society, ceaselessly fulfilling a diverse array of roles. From performing menial tasks and physical labor to acting as speedy vehicles, these constructs enable the taii'maku to dedicate their time to intellectual pursuits. Sentinel constructs vigilantly patrol the cities, responding to taii'maku commands and maintaining unwavering security. Transportation constructs range from horse-sized golems and massive mechanical wagons to soaring aerial machines and even city-sized, mobile Illus. The zenith of taii'maku engineering culminates in the impressive Giant Defenders, colossal constructs that rival the tallest giants and safeguard the Illus from ever-present threats.
	Yet, all taii'maku constructs necessitate fastidious maintenance to stave off corruption from their bauronite cores, which, if left unchecked, could render them uncontrollable and perilous.
	The taii'maku's resolute devotion to order, balance, and precision, coupled with their reverence for knowledge, forms the bedrock of their unique capabilities. They alone possess the aptitude to craft such remarkable constructs. Their culture fosters an environment that encourages ceaseless learning and innovation, transforming these constructs into more than just feats of engineering; they stand as emblematic representations of the taii'maku's relentless pursuit of progress.
	U'Tibam, the most eminent taii'maku mind of his era, epitomizes their exceptional intellect. His groundbreaking contributions to mathematics and the creation of the mightiest giant construct ever forged, a pivotal weapon against the Kemet Invasion, further highlight the taii'maku's ingenuity.
	The Illus frequently find themselves in need of specific resources to further their research or repair their constructs, often enlisting the aid of intrepid adventurers to procure the rare materials they require. Taii'Maku cities also tirelessly search for spies and purloined information or artifacts, offering bountiful rewards for their safe recovery. Prioritizing security above all else, the taii'maku remain perpetually vigilant for signs of infiltration, as the secrets of their constructs' creation and operation must be fiercely safeguarded.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Mathematical Approach to Magic</name>
      <text>In the arcane domain, the taii'maku stand as a testament to their revolutionary theories that intricately weave the tapestry of magic with the threads of mathematics. This matchless approach births the crafting of impeccably precise magic circles and potent enchanted artifacts, transcending the symbolic renderings typically employed by their wizardly counterparts.
	The taii'maku spellcasters envision the cosmos as bound by a set of logical principles that can be deciphered through mathematical expressions, deeming magic as an extension of the physical realm. This unique perspective enables them to interlace mathematics within their incantations, and as such, taii'maku wizards etch their spells as algebraic formulas in their grimoires, deeming conventional symbols to be cumbersome and inefficient.
	As bold adventurers embark on perilous journeys into the depths of time-forgotten ruins, they may chance upon ancient tomes inscribed by legendary taii'maku archmages or unearth enigmatic arcane mechanisms, both teeming with labyrinthine equations that call for the keen intellect of the most erudite taii'maku minds to decipher. As they navigate through the forsaken remnants of bygone Illus, they may unveil cryptic geometric patterns that cloak concealed chambers. Nestled within these shrouded sanctuaries, one may find elaborate taii'maku-crafted magic circles, poised to unleash formidable and mysterious forces.
	The taii'maku's unwavering belief in a world that is inherently logical and mathematically harmonious drives their relentless pursuit of transcending the limitations of the arcane. Through their groundbreaking amalgamation of mathematics and mysticism, they forge breathtaking spells, enchanted relics, and wondrous contraptions imbued with unparalleled potency.

      <text>Standing tall and robust, the taii'maku are pacifist intellectuals who favor logic over emotions. They excel in math and engineering, creating remarkable inventions.

"Cough... cough... excuse me. I'll put my pipe aside. Well, as I was saying, think of the world as a big structure full of intertwined gears, activated by the correct operation of levers. Therefore, if a part is defective, or if the synchronization is out of rhythm, the entire structure can be affected, generating a chain collapse. In this way, we must be quick and precise to detect which parts need maintenance or replacement, so that the movement is adequately preserved. I hope you don't mind the extra detail, I tend to get carried away with my explanations."
- U'Tibam, the most brilliant mind of Tanar

The taii'maku, a majestic and enigmatic species, exude an aura of reverence and admiration that leaves a lasting impression upon those who cross their path. Towering figures with sinewy builds and earth-toned complexions, their most captivating feature lies within their fascinating, luminous white eyes, which seem to radiate boundless intelligence and curiosity. A signature trait of the taii'maku is their near-absence of emotion, cultivated through meditation and adherence to a philosophy steeped in logic, enabling them to maintain a serene, respectful, and stoic demeanor, even in the most dire of circumstances.
	Possessing a keen, logic-driven intellect, the taii'maku prioritize rationality in their daily lives, exhibiting remarkable prowess in engineering and mathematics. They frequently categorize decisions as either "logical" or "illogical" when evaluating situations and determining their course of action. Even their spellcasters perceive magic as sophisticated formulas and complex equations, employing this knowledge to forge exceptional mechanical golems and constructs. The taii'maku's legendary mobile cities, known as Illus, are powered by the arcane energies harnessed from bauronite ores, epitomizing their unparalleled mastery in harmonizing magic and technology to birth utopian wonders.
	As a nomadic society, the taii'maku are in perpetual motion, ceaselessly seeking new resources and knowledge, while refining theories in mathematics, physics, magic, and the fabric of the cosmos. They hold libraries and educational institutions in the highest esteem, embodying their devotion to the pursuit and dissemination of knowledge.
	This mindset, however, can render the taii'maku ill equipped to comprehend or participate in humor. Some may take jests literally or fail to recognize them as such, while others may attempt humor without the inherent flair for it, resulting in contrived or ill-timed jokes that provoke laughter at their own expense, rather than shared mirth.
	Their polite and pacifist way make them easy to coexist with other species, but their lack of emotions and rational minds may inadvertently offend or alarm others. Elves and dwarves, particularly those who have lived longer, tend to share a more detached perspective on life, resonating with the taii'maku, while halflings, humans, and gloomfolk may perceive the taii'maku as arrogant or even immoral when they present unemotional and logical courses of action.
	The taii'maku approach the world through a practical and unvarnished lens, perceiving everything, including society itself, as a machine where each component must function harmoniously. They often endeavor to "fix" individuals through education, much like mending machines, structures, or other malfunctioning systems. While their precision and efficiency are indeed commendable, their stoic demeanor, emotional detachment, and impassive expressions can occasionally lead to miscommunication with other species.

      <name>Taii'maku History</name>
      <text>Born during the Godly Age, the brilliant taii'maku species emerged from the wills of Tamera and Bauron as a species created to bring progress and harmony, so they could extend this benevolence to all living beings.
	As a nomadic people, the taii'maku cleverly avoided conflict by employing their extraordinary engineering prowess and bauronite extraction methods to construct the Illus, their magnificent mobile cities. This enabled them to relocate continuously, evading disputes with neighboring species.
	When the Ungods first attacked, the taii'maku focused on protecting their people and providing refuge to others. They employed sophisticated magical constructs to fend off the relentless onslaught. However, the Ungods released the kikokus, sinister insectoid creatures capable of corrupting and controlling the taii'maku's constructs. Although the taii'maku eventually repelled the kikokus, the victory came at the cost of thousands of their lives.
	In the wake of this conflict, the taii'maku formed an alliance with humans, establishing the Malrokian Kingdom under King Malrok's vision of peaceful unity. They innovated the concept of nonviolent dispute resolution through athletic competition in specially designed arenas. Regrettably, this noble idea was later corrupted by the Tanarean Empire.
	The Cult of Shadow Wing infiltrated the Malrokian nobility, forcing the taii'maku to confront the tainted aristocracy. The nobles' greed and refusal to heed taii'maku advice culminated in the Malrokian Curse—a disaster that nearly destroyed the world. Disillusioned, the taii'maku withdrew to their Illus, seeking solace in knowledge and solitude.
	During the Imperial Age, Emperor Baleroth attempted to gain access to the taii'maku's magical and engineering expertise but was met with resistance. This covert persecution only exacerbated their isolationist tendencies and mistrust of other species.
	The Kemet Invasion marked a turning point. The Illus endured relentless assaults, and Tanares heroes and taii'maku champions provided crucial support. This siege exposed the dangers of isolation, prompting taii'maku heroes to persuade their people to reconnect and exchange knowledge with other species. Gradually, the Illus reintegrated into a broader network of commerce and intellectual collaboration.
	Today, the taii'maku navigate the intricate politics of the realms, striving to protect their secrets and uphold their values. Some Illus remain independent, while others form alliances or openly support factions. Many have joined the Allied Forces, exploring new strategies to fight the Ungods.
	Although they yearn for cooperative endeavors, the taii'maku encounter challenges from unpredictable behavior and conflicting agendas among various factions. Their councils maintain vigilance against espionage and deceit, working to safeguard taii'maku secrets. Despite these hurdles, they persist in strengthening their repositories of knowledge.
	In recent times, the taii'maku have assisted in developing infrastructure across numerous human cities, particularly within the Republic and the Tanarean Empire. Their excep tional construction and engineering expertise have vastly improved the quality of life in these regions. They have al so established a nuanced relationship with the Magocracy of Mage Tower, engaging in lively debates and exchanging wisdom with their mages. However, the taii'maku remain wary, expressing concerns about the ethical implications of certain experiments conducted by the Magocracy.</text>

      <name>Contributing to a Better World</name>
      <text>The taii'maku stand in Tanares as architects of progress, tirelessly striving to forge a harmonious existence for all inhabitants. Their commitment to innovation and progress has given rise to astonishing constructs that seamlessly perform tasks, ensuring transportation, security, and unwavering support in their quest for an idyllic society.
	Masters of their craft, the taii'maku have achieved seemingly impossible feats: quenching the parched desert with life-giving water, taming the fury of unyielding floods, and constructing sophisticated sanitation systems. Their ingenious roadways bridge the gaps between cities and kingdoms, fostering unity and cooperation in the face of adversity.
	Taii'maku cities serve as radiant beacons of their grand vision, with constructs assuming the mantle of manual labor, allowing the citizens to immerse themselves in contemplation, research, and personal growth. Massive mechanical wagons and swift-flying vessels transport people with ease, while constructs dutifully cater to every conceivable task.
	In their pursuit of a brighter future, the taii'maku remain ever vigilant against the persistent menace of the kikoku. With unwavering resolve, they thwart these sinister creatures' attempts to reproduce and breach their resplendent cities.
	The taii'maku wield wisdom and reason as formidable weapons, serving as advisors and guides in a world beset by strife and corruption. Their most gifted strategists and thinkers labor tirelessly to craft intricate plans and tactics to counter the insidious influence of the Ungods, extending aid and warnings to other realms, even when their words fall on deaf ears.
	Through their steadfast dedication to logic and unyielding resistance to the vices and temptations of the Ungods, the taii'maku emerge as a formidable adversary in the battle against malevolent forces. Their very existence presents a challenge that the Ungods are all too eager to eliminate, yet the taii'maku remain undeterred, resolute in their mission to unite and uplift the denizens of Tanares.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Taii'maku Society</name>
      <text>In the heart of the taii'maku civilization, a steadfast dedication to logic, rationality, and the pursuit of knowledge beats like a resonant drum. Eschewing traditional faith in deities, they perceive gods as highly evolved entities, masters of profound wisdom and comprehension of reality. Within their ranks, clerics and paladins exist, but they view them selves as emissaries of superior wisdom rather than servants of a divine being.
	The essence of taii'maku culture lies in order and balance, reflected by their harmonious, symmetrical, and geometric city architecture. Crafted with meticulous accuracy, their urban landscapes optimize mystical energy efficiency and resource management. Their cuisine, mirroring their methodical nature, emphasizes objectivity and efficiency over taste and presentation, crafting meals that deliver optimal health and nutrient intake.
	In their relationships, the taii'maku exhibit an extraordinary form of empathy. Devoid of emotional experience, it stems from understanding the logical and practical needs of others. Their ethical framework originates from a deep thought experiment in which they shed all knowledge of
	identity, status, and personal circumstances to impartially inhabit the lives of every individual. This process allows them to grasp the needs and perspectives of all beings, forging an ethical rule that is equitable and just for all. Such an approach is vital for the taii'maku to create a society that caters to everyone's needs without succumbing to oppression or tyranny.
	In pursuit of this ideal, they strive for a harmonious societal balance, ensuring the well-being of all without sacrificing the few. Every voice is heard and respected, fostering unity and shared understanding.
	Marriage in taii'maku society is deemed a logical obligation and lifelong commitment. Couples are selected based on intellectual compatibility and the potential to counter balance each other's weaknesses, resulting in partners with vastly different skill sets. When raising children, taii'maku parents display a profound sense of responsibility, attentive ness, and devotion, particularly in education and imparting wisdom. However, their parenting approach lacks the emotional warmth observed in other species.
	Society is structured around a knowledge-based hierarchy, with an individual's status determined by their contributions to collective wisdom. Their economy revolves around trading knowledge and bauronite ore, prioritizing the exchange of information, discoveries, ideas, and components for crafts and research over traditional gold coins. This system nurtures a culture of perpetual learning and innovation.
	Taii'maku governance is anchored in public councils led by the eldest members, inviting anyone with a contribution to engage in discussions. Decisions are made through vot ing, emphasizing logic over personal biases and frequently resulting in unanimous or near-unanimous outcomes, as they discuss until every individual is satisfied.
	The deep Taii'maku language, comprised of intricate symbols and exact mathematical forms, enables efficient and meticulous idea exchanges, unparalleled in Tanares. In leisure, they partake in intellectual debates, exchanging logical arguments to persuade their audience, or team sports that demand exceptional coordination and tactics.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Math, Engineering, and Constructs</name>
      <text>Within the great halls of the taii'maku civilization, an un paralleled mastery of mathematics, engineering, and magic reverberates through every aspect of their intricate culture. This extraordinary fusion breathes life into a myriad of con structs, each pulsating with the volatile yet potent mystical energies of bauronite.
	Highly advanced constructs serve as the lifeblood of taii'maku society, ceaselessly fulfilling a diverse array of roles. From performing menial tasks and physical labor to acting as speedy vehicles, these constructs enable the taii'maku to dedicate their time to intellectual pursuits. Sentinel constructs vigilantly patrol the cities, responding to taii'maku commands and maintaining unwavering security. Transportation constructs range from horse-sized golems and massive mechanical wagons to soaring aerial machines and even city-sized, mobile Illus. The zenith of taii'maku engineering culminates in the impressive Giant Defenders, colossal constructs that rival the tallest giants and safeguard the Illus from ever-present threats.
	Yet, all taii'maku constructs necessitate fastidious maintenance to stave off corruption from their bauronite cores, which, if left unchecked, could render them uncontrollable and perilous.
	The taii'maku's resolute devotion to order, balance, and precision, coupled with their reverence for knowledge, forms the bedrock of their unique capabilities. They alone possess the aptitude to craft such remarkable constructs. Their culture fosters an environment that encourages ceaseless learning and innovation, transforming these constructs into more than just feats of engineering; they stand as emblematic representations of the taii'maku's relentless pursuit of progress.
	U'Tibam, the most eminent taii'maku mind of his era, epitomizes their exceptional intellect. His groundbreaking contributions to mathematics and the creation of the mightiest giant construct ever forged, a pivotal weapon against the Kemet Invasion, further highlight the taii'maku's ingenuity.
	The Illus frequently find themselves in need of specific resources to further their research or repair their constructs, often enlisting the aid of intrepid adventurers to procure the rare materials they require. Taii'Maku cities also tirelessly search for spies and purloined information or artifacts, offering bountiful rewards for their safe recovery. Prioritizing security above all else, the taii'maku remain perpetually vigilant for signs of infiltration, as the secrets of their constructs' creation and operation must be fiercely safeguarded.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Mathematical Approach to Magic</name>
      <text>In the arcane domain, the taii'maku stand as a testament to their revolutionary theories that intricately weave the tapestry of magic with the threads of mathematics. This matchless approach births the crafting of impeccably precise magic circles and potent enchanted artifacts, transcending the symbolic renderings typically employed by their wizardly counterparts.
	The taii'maku spellcasters envision the cosmos as bound by a set of logical principles that can be deciphered through mathematical expressions, deeming magic as an extension of the physical realm. This unique perspective enables them to interlace mathematics within their incantations, and as such, taii'maku wizards etch their spells as algebraic formulas in their grimoires, deeming conventional symbols to be cumbersome and inefficient.
	As bold adventurers embark on perilous journeys into the depths of time-forgotten ruins, they may chance upon ancient tomes inscribed by legendary taii'maku archmages or unearth enigmatic arcane mechanisms, both teeming with labyrinthine equations that call for the keen intellect of the most erudite taii'maku minds to decipher. As they navigate through the forsaken remnants of bygone Illus, they may unveil cryptic geometric patterns that cloak concealed chambers. Nestled within these shrouded sanctuaries, one may find elaborate taii'maku-crafted magic circles, poised to unleash formidable and mysterious forces.
	The taii'maku's unwavering belief in a world that is inherently logical and mathematically harmonious drives their relentless pursuit of transcending the limitations of the arcane. Through their groundbreaking amalgamation of mathematics and mysticism, they forge breathtaking spells, enchanted relics, and wondrous contraptions imbued with unparalleled potency. It is their fervent aspiration to harness these mystical creations to reshape the world for the better.</text>
