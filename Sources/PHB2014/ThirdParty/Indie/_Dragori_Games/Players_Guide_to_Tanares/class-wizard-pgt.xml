        <name>Arcane Tradition: Lost Magic Researcher (HB)</name>
        <text>The downfall of Arcana marked the end of an era for magic, but the knowledge and power of the arcane still lies hidden in dungeons and ruins across Tanares. The Lost Magic Researchers are wizards who have dedicated themselves to uncovering the secrets of the ancient mages, who once wielded magic with greater proficiency and potency.
	These wizards boast a deep understanding of the arcane and have developed unique methods for augmenting their magic to levels beyond what is seen in the present day. They are also physically fit, a testament to their adventurous spirit and fearless pursuit of knowledge, as they delve into dungeons, climb down treacherous tunnels, and excavate long-forgotten ruins to uncover the secrets of the arcane.
	Lost Magic Researchers are adventurers at heart, driven by a thirst for discovery and a fearless spirit. They are not content to simply hone their craft within the safety of their towers, but instead brave dangers to seek out the knowledge of the past. Whether they are treasure hunters, archaeologists, cartographers, or even mercenaries, these wizards are united by their unwavering determination to unlock the secrets of the arcane.

Lost Magic Researchers in Tanares:
The Mystical Kingdom is shrouded in tales of its mighty wizards and their mastery of magic. Some believe that they pushed the limits of the Tanarean Magic Field, the magical fabric that enshrouds the world. These experiments resulted in magnificent wonders, but also claimed the lives of some of the practitioners. Vaeraunt, the Mastermind and leader of the Magocracy of Mage Tower, is one such practitioner and scholar of Lost Magic, who encourages young and daring arcane apprentices to pursue the same path, despite the dangers. These wizards delve into ruins and ancient sites in search of knowledge about these lost arts and share their findings with Vaeraunt.
	Archmage Avelum, the former founder of the Magocracy of Mage Tower, now trains chosen apprentices in his new home within the Republic of Freelands, a land of heroes and freedom. Avelum only selects the most capable individuals to tread this perilous path, fully cognizant of its inherent dangers. Although less common, practitioners of Lost Magic can still be found among evil factions. Some of them belong to the Cult of Shadow Wing, utilizing their expertise to unearth ancient artifacts that could further the Ungod's plans.
	Others may work for the kemets or Golg√∂ggoth, seeking ways to advance their agenda of global domination. Regardless of their affiliation, Lost Magic Researchers venture into ancient or forbidden realms with an unprecedented level of freedom.

In Other Settings:
Worlds are rarely brand new and without their share of mystery and lost treasures. Adapt your research to fit with an ancient civilization in the setting, or simply consider that you are after the knowledge and experiments left behind by wizards who died. If that is somehow not possible, then you are at the forefront of magic as an empirical science in your world, seeking to break the traditional boundaries of magic and elevate your spells beyond the known limits.

        <name>Mystic Detection (Lost Magic Researcher (HB))</name>
        <text>At 14th level, your quest for mystical artifacts has sharpened your ability to detect relics, objects, traps, and the flow of magical energy.
	You can sense any magic within a 90-foot radius, whether present in a magic item, artifact, creature, or location affected by magic. With an action, you can identify the nature of the magic, its level, and its school of magic, if applicable.
	If the source of the magic is an item or artifact, touching it will reveal its properties, usage methods, potential dangers, and any attunement requirements. You can also determine if the item was crafted through magic and the nature of that magic.
	If the magic source is a creature, touching it reveals the magic affecting it, its effects, and at the GM's discretion, the steps required to remove it.
