        <name>Martial Archetype: Death Knight (HB)</name>
        <text>The death knight is a fearsome warrior who wields the very essence of death's power. This chilling bond may arise from arcane rituals, a miraculous resurrection, or an encounter with the afterlife that attunes the warrior to death's dark might.
	Misunderstood and dreaded, Death Knights are often perceived as cold, sinister beings, seemingly indifferent to death itself. However, they merely regard it as an intrinsic aspect of life's cycle, a force they harness with great efficacy.
	In kemet society, Death Knights have achieved fame for their insatiable thirst for battle and intimate connection with death, leading to the refinement of necromantic augmentations over countless generations. They also emerge in other death-revering cultures such as the Kepesh, as well as amongst malevolent cults, corrupted Dorsianist dwarves, and Shadow Wing devotees. Remarkably, virtuous Death Knights can be found among a few tragic heroes and the Republic-aligned winter elves who renounced Gullog.
	Although Death Knights need not be inherently malevolent, it requires a stoic or extraordinary individual to attune their existence to death's dominion. Regardless, the mere presence of a Death Knight is a formidable threat, for their unyielding pursuit of victory is undeterred by the specter of death.

In Other Settings:
The Death Knight, a wielder of death's dark might, can be found in any world where the shadow of death looms over warriors. An inseparable part of life's cycle, death holds a captivating allure for those who stand in its presence, be it by their own choice or by the fates.
	This fearsome subclass can take on many forms: a fallen champion, a harbinger of evil, a warrior risen from the dead seeking retribution, or even a hero shrouded in mystery, harnessing a power feared by many for the greater good. Yet the Death Knight is not limited to just these archetypes. They can also be malevolent tyrants, leading an army of undead to conquer the lands, anti-heroes, wielding death's power in their quest for redemption, or even servants of death gods, serving as their deity's chosen instrument of destruction.
	Regardless of their role, the Death Knight is a force to be reckoned with, for death holds no sway over their relentless pursuit of victory. With their inextricable connection to death and mastery of its power, the mere mention of a Death Knight's name is enough to strike fear into the hearts of their enemies, making them a formidable presence on any battlefield.

        <name>Death Soul (Death Knight (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, you forge a bond with death and learn to harness its power through special energy points called Soul Points.

Death Powers:
You learn 3 Death Powers, which must be chosen from the Death Power List, and gain an additional one at levels 7th, 10th, 14th, and 18th. Some Death Powers have specific level requirements, which are noted in their description.

Saving Throws:
When a Death Power requires a creature to make a saving throw against its effect, the DC is calculated as follows:

	Death Power save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

Soul Points:
You have 2 Soul Points and gain an additional Soul Point at 10th level. One Soul Point is always spent when using a Death Power. You regain all of your Soul Points after taking a short or long rest.
	Additionally, you gain 1 Soul Point whenever an intelligent creature (Intelligence 3 or higher), excluding constructs, dies within 15 feet of you, by taking part of the energy released by its essence. However, the maximum number of Soul Points you can accumulate is equal to 1 plus your proficiency bonus, and any Soul Points gained in this manner are lost after taking a short or long rest.

        <text>Starting at 7th level, when you make a death saving throw, any roll of 3 or higher is considered a success. If you roll a 1, it counts as only one failure. Additionally, if you roll a 20, you regain hit points equal to your level instead of just 1. However, you still automatically fail death saving throws if you take damage while you are at 0 hit points.
	Additionally, as a bonus action, you can spend 1 Soul Point to regain up to 3 spent Hit Dice. You can use this additional effect once, regaining its use after a long rest.

        <name>Undead Master (Death Knight (HB))</name>
        <text>At 15th level, your intimate bond with death allows you to command the undead. You may cause any undead creature within a radius of 120 feet, who can see you, to make a Wisdom saving throw against your Death Power save DC. If it fails, the undead creature perceives you as a leader and becomes friendly, obeying your instructions.
	Intelligent undead creatures (Int 5+), however, have advantage on this saving throw and can resist your commands if you cause them harm or act against their fundamental beliefs. These intelligent undead can repeat their saving throw every 24 hours, potentially breaking free from your control. After 48 hours without your presence, any undead will automatically break free from this effect. You can only control a number of undead equal to your class level at the same time.

        <text>At 18th level, you exist in the twilight zone between life and death. You don't require food, drink, or sleep, and you cannot be affected by sleep effects or the frightened condition. Even though you don't need sleep, taking a long rest still requires at least 4 hours of inactivity to rejuvenate your body and mind. During this period, you remain alert and do not need to be unconscious.
