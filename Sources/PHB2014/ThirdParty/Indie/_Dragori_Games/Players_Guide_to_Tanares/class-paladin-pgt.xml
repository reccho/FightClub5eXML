        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Freedom (HB)</name>
        <text>The Oath of Freedom symbolizes a paladin's unbreakable spirit to rid the world of tyranny and defend the innocent from oppression. Known as Free Knights, these liberators rise above the limitations of religious institutions, instead following their own unwavering principles in their quest for justice. In a world where the very foundations of law and order can be corrupted and used as weapons of oppression, these heroes stand tall, enshrining the ideals of equality, fraternity, and liberty above all else.
	Free Knights approach each mission with unrelenting dedication and urgency, never backing down from the challenge at hand. Whether it be rescuing a lost child or exposing a corrupt church cardinal conspiring with evil forces, they work tirelessly and discreetly, never seeking recognition or glory for their heroic deeds. After each successful mission, they vanish into the night, ready to continue their endless fight against evil in all its forms.
	These paladins are faithful to deities of goodness and freedom, nurturing a relationship of reverence and respect with their divine patrons, rather than one of servitude. They embark on personal quests to overthrow tyrants, aid the needy, and defend freedom, unwaveringly upholding the ideals of liberty and unity, even in the face of conflicting laws and societal norms. With their skills, training, and unbreakable spirit, Free Knights roam the lands, fearlessly investigating and vanquishing evil wherever it may hide.

In Tanares:
Deemed heretics by the old Evolutionist Church, the Free Knights remained resolute in their pursuit of justice, combating corruption even within the Church's core. Their unwavering dedication to liberty has garnered respect and admiration from virtuous clerics and paladins within the Church who share their vision of a world liberated from oppression and tyranny.
	When the Church initiated reforms, the Free Knights were among the first to confront and combat corrupt members. However, after the initial purge, these liberators declined to join the Celestianist ranks, believing their duty necessitates maintaining a distance from the Church's hierarchy.
	These valiant warriors serve as beacons of hope, venturing into the shadows as lone champions to eradicate evil and safeguard the innocent. Fearless vigilantes, they relentlessly combat corruption and injustice, irrespective of its hiding place. Alternatively, they may lead gallant bands of adventurers, united in their quest to deliver hope and justice to a beleaguered world. With indomitable spirit and determination, the Free Knights are the custodians of freedom, never swayed by power's allure or the beckoning of a single faction, but perpetually championing righteousness and virtue.

Principles of Freedom:
Each Oath of Freedom is unique, reflecting the liberator's personal values and beliefs. However, the principles of kindness, selflessness, and freedom are firmly entrenched in all Free Knights.

Autonomy. Reject any organization or power that may restrict your ability to bring about good.

Goodness. Continuously strive to bring the greatest good to all whom your path may lead.

Inspiration. Lead by example, not by edict. Serve as a beacon of hope for the oppressed, inspiring others to join your noble cause.

Freedom. Defend individual freedoms and hold those accountable who threaten free will. Battle all forms of tyranny and oppression, and defend the ideals of equality, fraternity, and liberty.

Solidarity. Stand with the vulnerable and the oppressed, holding accountable those who would oppress them. Unite with others who share your ideals, and together, work towards building a better world for all.

        <name>Aura of Sacrifice (Oath of Freedom (HB))</name>
        <text>At 7th level, your dedication to protect your allies manifests in a tangible manner. If a creature within 15 feet of you suffers damage and you are conscious and able to perceive the creature, you can choose to mystically absorb half of that damage as a free action.
