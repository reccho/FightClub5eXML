      <name>Scoundrel</name>
      <text>Scoundrels are simplified rogues. They are ideal for new players who are looking for a less complexity or to create a more straightforward character without sacrificing effectiveness during play.
	Scoundrels are the very embodiment of cunning and guile, renowned for their mischievous tricks and underhanded dealings. Their sharp minds and silver tongues deceive with effortless charm, beguiling those around them and manipulating their adversaries to their advantage. With a love for the shadows and a disdain for fame, they are driven by wealth, adventure, or personal causes.
	Life on the street has honed the scoundrels into fiercely independent and cynical individuals, with a soul tempered by the harsh realities of survival. They learned to be acrobatic and agile, exploiting the weaknesses of their enemies and delivering devastating blows to their critical points with precision and speed. Wielding light weapons like daggers, they rely on speed and agility over brute force, moving with fluid grace that leaves their foes disoriented and struggling to keep up.
	In combat, scoundrels are the ultimate thieves and tricksters, leaving a trail of confusion in their wake. Their cunning, swiftness, and ability to strike from unexpected angles make them formidable opponents, cementing their reputation as masters of the shadows. With a carefree exterior and a quick wit, they are both dangerous and unpredictable, making them a valuable asset to any adventure group. But with their love for wealth and tendency to be motivated by personal gain, they can also be lucky yet unreliable allies. Scoundrels are survivors of the street, and their skills are the result of a lifetime of mischief, sly, and crafty schemes.
	You can't multiclass into Simplified Classes, or multiclass if you are a Simplified Class.
