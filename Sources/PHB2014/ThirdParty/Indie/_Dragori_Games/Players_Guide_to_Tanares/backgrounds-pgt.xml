d6 | Personality Trait
1 I love taking risks, and the more dangerous the job, the more inclined I am to take it.
2 I am considered vain for loving my work, but I can't understand how people are not able to see the beauty and refinement of mapmaking.
3 I have trouble concentrating on matters unrelated to my work.
4 I am very nostalgic, always commenting on places I've been to and taking every opportunity to show my notes and maps to others.
5 I collect a very particular thing, maybe stones, dirt samples or ancient maps from lost civilizations. I don't usually feel the need to talk about my collection, but if someone shows interest about it, I will spend hours talking about it.
6 I consider my craft one of the wonders — and necessities — of the world today, and I feel insulted or shocked if someone has not heard of it.

d6 | Ideal
1 | Community. I believe my gift should be used for society's common good. (Good)
2 | Tradition. Cartography is a timeless and delicate art which survived the greatest disasters, and must be preserved. (Lawful)
3 | Greed. I am always after making money in any way I can, and this is the only reason why I dedicate myself to this activity. (Evil)
4 | Aspiration. I strive to be the best in what I do, and therefore I will offer the best of my effort at everything. (Any)
5 | Beauty. More than geographical consultation, maps should convey the beauty and uniqueness of each place — so that we crave to explore those that are still uncharted. (Good)
6 | Avant-garde. There are many ways to represent the world, and I will show it to the traditionalists. (Chaotic)

d6 | Bond
1 | I might never be able to repay all the good things someone has done for me.
2 | I left my family to pursue my calling, they never understood what it meant for me.
3 | I have deep admiration for a famous cartographer, and was accused many times of copying his style.
4 | I learned my trade with someone who was first like a brother to me; he then became a rival. To this day, we compete at everything.
5 | My tools were stolen and I am set on recovering them.
While I can manage with those I'm carrying for the moment, I believe that only with my original tools I might reach my full potential.
6 | My journey is meant for me to prove myself and earn a beloved person's hand in marriage.

d6 | Flaw
1 | I am certain I am destined for greatness, and I will stop at nothing to earn more recognition, and a nobility title.
2 | I overindulge in earthly pleasures, and I will often spend my resources recklessly and selfishly if the occasion allows it.
3 | Any sense of self-preservation I might have disappears when I am presented with the opportunity to know and explore new sites.
4 | I see rivals and obstacles everywhere, and this hampers my personal growth and my ability to trust colleagues and adventurers.
5 | I was disgraced for plagiarizing a piece of work. I am deeply ashamed of that and I will try to hide this fact at any cost.
6 | I am a ruthless critic of the work of others, both within my field of work as in all other aspects of my life.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>You live in the shadows, your true identity shrouded in secrecy, while another identity allows you to navigate the tumultuous world of Tanares with ease. Perhaps you pose as a humble farmer, a stoic soldier, or even something more sinister. You have spent so much time in this other skin that it feels like a part of you, and you are recognized for it even in other regions. With the growing tensions of the Cold War, your unique ability to move unnoticed between your two identities provides a distinct advantage, allowing you to gather invaluable information for espionage purposes. But as the stakes become higher, the lines between your true self and your other identity begin to blur, and the risk of being discovered looms ever larger.

	• Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Investigation
	• Tool Proficiencies: Disguise kit
	• Equipment: Two sets of common clothes, two sets of documents for each identity, a sturdy bag, and a small pouch containing 15 gp

      <name>Feature: Another Life</name>
      <text>You possess a second identity that you've developed over the years, complete with the necessary documentation to authenticate each persona. You are known by one identity or the other, depending on the region or location you're in. Your extensive experience in living a double life has made you an expert in secrecy, and you must not need to make any ability check when trying to make people believe you are one of your two established identities.</text>

      <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
      <text>In a world wrought with instability and strife, the value of secrecy and stealth cannot be overstated. Espionage reigns supreme and those with the ability to blend in seamlessly with their surroundings are highly prized. Such individuals are often aloof, with a guarded air about them as they keep their true identities close to the vest. Every step they take, every word they utter, is calculated to maintain their disguise. The weight of their responsibility can lead to paranoia, constantly scanning their surroundings for any hint of danger.
	Yet, not all who walk in shadows are wrought with anxiety. Some have a natural magnetism, a charm that allows them to slip into a role like a second skin. They possess an innate ability to blend in with the most disparate of crowds, effortlessly becoming someone else entirely. But, even for those with a silver tongue, maintaining multiple identities is an arduous task. One slip-up, one careless mistake, and the consequences can be dire. A moment's distraction can bring an end to their carefully crafted charade and plunge them into the heart of danger.
