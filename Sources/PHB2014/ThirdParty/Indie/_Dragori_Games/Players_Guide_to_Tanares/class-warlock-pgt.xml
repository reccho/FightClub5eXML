      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Otherworldly Patron: Dark Hunter (HB)</name>
        <text>You made a pact with an obscure otherworldly entity that refuses to reveal its true origin, sharing with you only its goal: to destroy all aberrations and unnatural creatures that plague the multiverse. It desires you to act as its hand in your world, eradicating the dark beings hidden in the shadows.
	Different from other warlocks you train your body and mind to exhaustion to fight the creatures of darkness. You learn how to properly use all kinds of weapons to deliver your powerful magic abilities, channeling your powers through blades and bolts alike, becoming the terror of all dark beings.
	Moved by vengeance, a strange sense of justice, or some other personal goal, your path is often dark, grim, and solitary. One that most common folk would never have the guts to take, but that is the reason most warloks of the Dark Hunter choose this path.

In Tanares:
In the shadowy recesses of Tanares, warlocks of the Dark Hunter emerge as enigmatic figures, often misconstrued as perilous vigilantes. Yet, in reality, they are the unsung champions of the realm, selflessly risking their lives to shield the innocent and eradicate the malevolence that skulks in the shadows.
	Equipped with weapons infused with dark energies and wielding sinister magic to bolster their pursuit, these warlocks instill fear in their adversaries and command respect for their unparalleled expertise in tracking down monstrous beings. However, their notoriety as relentless aberration exterminators frequently engenders misunderstanding and suspicion from the masses.
	In truth, the warlocks of the Dark Hunter maintain their distance not due to their foreboding reputation, but because they recognize that proximity to others would only invite danger and suffering. Witnessing the ramifications of their actions and the wickedness they hunt, they opt to operate in solitude or as affiliates of the Celestianist Church to mitigate risks to those dear to them.
	Despite their solitary dispositions, these warlocks exhibit unwavering loyalty to their comrades, stopping at nothing to safeguard those they trust. As the vanguards of the innocent, they vanquish evil with calculated precision, employing darkness to combat darkness in a bid to restore equilibrium to the world. When peril looms, they are summoned to defend the innocent, responding with unshakeable resolve and courage.
	In a realm besieged by darkness and depravity, warlocks of the Dark Hunter are beacons of hope for the despondent and sanctuaries for the fearful. Though their path is fraught with shadow, desolation, and isolation, they stand as the steadfast guardians of Tanares, relentlessly battling to shield the world from the encroachment of evil.

        <name>Bane of Darkness (Dark Hunter (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 1st level, your mystical abilities become more potent against the unnatural creatures you are called to hunt. When you hit with a weapon attack against an aberration, undead, or a creature not native to the Material Plane, deal an additional 1d6 damage. This extra damage bypasses any resistance or immunity. This damage increases to 1d8 at 9th level, and to 1d10 at 17th level.

        <name>Dark Hunter (Dark Hunter (HB))</name>
        <text>At 1st level, you master the skills necessary for your mission. You gain proficiency with Perception and Stealth skills, as well as shields and martial weapons.
	Your patron grants you the ability to channel your magic through any weapon you wield. You may use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for attack and damage rolls when wielding a weapon.
	In addition, you may apply any invocations that produce an effect or additional damage upon a hit with an Eldritch Blast to your weapon attacks. This does not allow the use of invocations altering attack range or area.

        <name>Shadow Leap (Dark Hunter (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 6th level, your bond with the mysterious entity that empowers you deepens, allowing you to traverse distances instantaneously by stepping through an enigmatic plane. As a bonus action, you may teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.
	You may use this feature a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded up), and regain all expended uses after a short or long rest.

        <name>Cover of Darkness (Dark Hunter (HB))</name>
        <text>At 10th level, you can envelop yourself in darkness to defend against attacks. When a creature you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve its attack's damage against you and inflict 2d8 force damage on the attacker.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Terror of the Dark (Dark Hunter (HB))</name>
        <text>At 14th level, you gain the ability to sense the presence of unnatural creatures. You are always aware if any aberration, undead, or a creature not native to the Material Plane is within 60 feet of you, even if the creature is hidden.
	You can discern the direction and number of such creatures, as well as their general appearance, but you glean no further information. This ability doesn't grant you sight of these entities, but rather, an intuition of their presence.
	When you slay one of these creatures, all others within 60 feet of you that can see you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, they become frightened for 1 minute. Creatures immune to fear effects are not immune to this effect if they have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher.
