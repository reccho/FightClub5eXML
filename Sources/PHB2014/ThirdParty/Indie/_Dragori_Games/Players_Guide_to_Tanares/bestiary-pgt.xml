      <text>Greed watches over the material world from the Penumbral Plane via its magical Mask of Scrying. When they spy an appropriate target, usually some crusading do-gooder or powerful noble, they shift to the Material Plane and attack with their covetous globes. The globes cause enough damage to seem like a real threat, but this is a ruse. Their real power lies in the transmission of the Curse of Greed.</text>

      <text>Every day at dusk, in which a victim of this terrible curse fails to accumulate at least 500 gp in gold, goods, or treasures, their maximum hit points are reduced by 2 (1d4) points. The curse cannot be lifted by a simple remove curse spell, but it does grant the recipient the knowledge of how to end the curse. To remove a Curse of Greed, the victim must permanently sacrifice at least 10,000 gold pieces in valuable items, such as useful magic items, family heirlooms of great sentimental value, or other treasures.</text>

    <description>The tanarean pegasus is a stunning creature, known for its striking beauty and natural grace. This breed of pegasus boasts an impressive wingspan of up to 20 feet, making it a highly coveted mount for those seeking swift transportation and superior strength. However, training and handling this creature can present unique challenges. The tanarean pegasus lacks the intelligence of its regular pegasus counterpart, making it skittish and difficult to gain trust and obedience from. These instincts of self-preservation and tendency to flee can make the training process longer and more complicated.

To train a tanarean pegasus successfully, a trainer must create a secure and comfortable environment, introduce it to other trained mounts to develop socialization skills, and establish trust through consistent, patient handling and training. Despite these challenges, the tanarean pegasus is a valuable asset in Tanares, with its beauty, strength, and speed making it a worthy mount for those willing to put in the effort to train it.

Cost to training and Flying Points:
Base: 6 Flying Points
Monthly Cost | Extra Flying Points
20 gp | +1d6
50 gp | +2d6
80 gp | +3d6
120 gp | +4d6

Flying Maneuvers:

Rescue (2 FP). You can save an ally from falling. Use your reaction to fly to an ally that is falling within your flying range and hold them in the air. Apply only if another flying mounted enemy caused the falling.

Dive (2 FP). Using your mount's flight superiority, you quickly get out of the way of danger. You can take a reaction when you succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against an effect from another flying mounted enemy that would cause you to take half damage, such as fireball, to take no damage from the effect.

Flight Tenacity (4 FP). You know the dangerous movements of mounted enemies that would make you fall from the griffon. Whenever you or your mount would begin to fall due to an effect caused by a flying-mounted enemy, you can use this maneuver as a reaction to prevent the fall, considering a failed saving throw or ability check, if any, as a success.

Aerial Sprint (2 FP). The pegasus' instinct takes over and it charges against the mounted creature. As a bonus action, the mount gains extra flying speed for the current turn. The increase equals twice its flying speed (after applying any modifiers), but the mount must move toward a target flying-mounted enemy.

Inspiring Flying (3 FP). All allies gain 2 Flying Points. The mount regains this use after finishing a short or long rest.

    <description>The tanarean griffon is a fearsome creature with the powerful body of a lion and the majestic wings and head of an eagle. With a more muscular body than a regular griffon, it is a formidable opponent in combat. Though the tanarean griffon lacks intelligence and magical abilities, it more than makes up for it with its ferocity and strength. This makes it a difficult creature to train and control, requiring a patient and skilled trainer to gain its trust and loyalty.

The tanarean griffon can be unpredictable and aggressive, with a tendency to assert dominance over weaker foes. To successfully train one, a trainer must establish their own dominance and earn the griffon's respect through consistent handling and training. Providing a secure and comfortable environment is crucial to developing the creature's trust and obedience. Despite its challenges, the tanarean griffon is a powerful and imposing creature that can serve as a mount or companion for those who are willing to put in the effort to train it.

Cost to training and Flying Points:
Base: 6 Flying Points
Monthly Cost | Extra Flying Points
25 gp | +1d6
60 gp | +2d6
90 gp | +3d6
130 gp | +4d6

Flying Maneuvers:

Flight Destabilization (3 FP). A powerfull bull rush that can unbalance flying mounted enemies. As an attack, you try to destabilize the target's flight. The target must make a Dexterity or Strength saving throw with DC = 8 + griffon's Strength modifier + proficiency bonus. If it fails, it plummets towards the ground.

Winged Resilience (3 FP). The griffon's agility can be very effective against flying mounted enemies. Spend Flying Points to reduce the damage inflicted by a flying mounted enemy's attack by 12 points.

Flight Tenacity (4 FP). You know the dangerous movements of mounted enemies that would make you fall from the griffon. Whenever you or your mount would begin to fall due to an effect caused by a flying-mounted enemy, you can use this maneuver as a reaction to prevent the fall, considering a failed saving throw or ability check, if any, as a success.

Aerial Sprint (2 FP). The griffon' instinct takes over and it charges against a target flying mounted enemy. As a bonus action, the mount gains extra flying speed for the current turn. The increase equals twice its flying speed (after applying any modifiers), but the mount must move toward a target flying-mounted enemy.

Fearsome Claws (3FP). Three enemies lose 2 Flying Points. The mount regains this use after finishing a short or long rest.

    <description>The tanarean hippogriff is a majestic creature with the body of a horse and the head and wings of an eagle. Like its regular hippogriff counterpart, it can grow up to 10 feet in length and possesses incredible speed and agility. However, the tanarean hippogriff lacks intelligence, making it challenging to train and control. It can be skittish and easily frightened, requiring a patient and skilled trainer to gain its trust and obedience.

To train a tanarean hippogriff successfully, a trainer must create a safe and comfortable environment and introduce the hippogriff to other trained mounts to develop socialization skills. The trainer must also establish trust through consistent handling and training. Despite its challenges, the tanarean hippogriff is a valuable and sought-after creature, prized for its speed, agility, and even beauty.

Base: 4 Flying Points
Monthly cost | Extra Flying Points
15 gp +1d4
30 gp +2d4

    <description>The drake is a formidable creature that strikes fear into the hearts of many adventurers. With its muscular body, sharp claws, and fiery breath, it is a formidable opponent in combat. The drake is a solitary beast that does not form bonds with others. This makes it difficult to train and control, as it will only obey those it is intimidated by. The drake is also intelligent and can be difficult to outsmart, requiring a trainer with considerable skill and experience. To gain dominance over a drake, a trainer must establish authority and maintain a constant level of intimidation. While firm vocalization and daunting body language are usually sufficient, drakes occasionally try to engage in fights to demonstrate physical superiority. Therefore, it will sometimes be necessary to resort to physical intimidation with them, but it must be administered carefully to avoid triggering a worse violent response. Once the drake has been subdued, it can be trained in a variety of techniques, such as hunting and aerial combat exercises.

Drakes are carnivorous creatures that feed on a variety of prey, such as mammals and other creatures of the sky. Their diet is essential to maintaining their physical strength and agility. Training a Drake is a dangerous and difficult task, but those who are able to successfully train one will have a loyal and powerful companion that will serve them well in any adventure.

The only way to avoid this effect is to spend 6 Flying Points.
