        <name>Sorcerous Origin: Cultist (HB)</name>
        <text>The cataclysmic Malrokian Curse that shook the very foundations of Arcana, forever changed the Tanarean Magic Field. Many mages were suddenly severed from their magic, sending them on a desperate journey to reclaim it. Some ventured into the shadows, striking deals with enigmatic forces and embracing forbidden powers in their quest for magical restoration. This gave rise to new, sinister cults, filled with individuals who thirsted for power and sought to harness the malevolent forces of mystical energies.
	These cults formed unbreakable bonds with the unseen, transmitting their powers to future generations and unlocking new, mysterious methods of harnessing magic. But the power they obtained came with a terrible cost, warping their perceptions of reality and driving them to become fanatically unstable, consumed by their hunger for power. Despite this, they honed their obsession, amplifying their magic and summoning servants of pure nightmare from the penumbral plane.
	Today, numerous cultists have pledged their allegiance to various factions, the majority of which harbor malevolent intentions. Foremost among these is the Cult of Shadow Wing, a sinister congregation of Ungod devotees determined to unleash cataclysm upon Tanares and subjugate the world to the whims of their dark deities.
	Within the Cult, myriad subgroups flourish, each exemplifying the diverse methods of serving the four Ungods. Among them are the sly and duplicitous Purple Witches, as well as the formidable penumbral dragons, demonstrating the multifaceted nature of devotion in these unhallowed circles.
	On the other hand, some cultists have chosen to ally themselves with organizations that promote nobler causes. The Mage Tower's Council, for example, is dedicated to safeguarding the freedom of spellcasters to study and explore magic, while the Relic Hunters, driven by their love of adventure and desire to do good, roam the land in search of lost artifacts from the past, be they magical, artistic, or mundane. These fearless explorers wield their political influence to protect the knowledge and treasures of antiquity for future generations.

In Other Settings:
Cultists are malevolent figures that cast a foreboding shadow over any campaign setting. Tied to sources of power that are both strange and corrupt, such as demons, aberrations, malevolent gods, and the forces of the shadows, these unique characters stand out due to their fanatical devotion and their power to summon creatures deemed profane by society. While not all Cultists are inherently evil, their relentless pursuit of power and their questionable methods make them feared and reviled by all.
	The Cultist subclass brings a thick veil of mystery and unease to the game, making them ideal for creating characters that are both enigmatic and intimidating, or infusing any character with a sinister and mystical energy.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Fanatacism (Cultist (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 1st level, your obsession allows you to channel your powers to persist even under dire circumstances. When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you do not fall unconscious. You can act normally and take turns, though you still make death saving throws as usual and incur automatic failed death saves if you take damage.
	However, if you fail two death saving throws, including automatic failures from taking damage at 0 hit points, you immediately fall unconscious. Moreover, you only die after failing four death saving throws instead of three.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Summon from the Penumbra (Cultist (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 6th level, as an action, you can summon an eldritch spirit and imbue it with your magical power, turning it into a creature that obeys your commands. The creature manifests in an unoccupied space you can see within 90 feet of you.
	This creature is friendly to you and your companions. In combat, the creature takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys verbal commands that you give (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands, it defends itself but otherwise takes no action.
	When you summon the spirit, choose the Sloth Invocation, Envy Invocation, or Gluttony Invocation. The creature physically resembles the chosen aspect, which also determines some traits in its stat block.
	You can use this feature once, regaining use after a short or long rest. You can only have one such creature summoned at a time. If you use this feature while you already have a creature summoned from this feature, the previous creature disappears.
