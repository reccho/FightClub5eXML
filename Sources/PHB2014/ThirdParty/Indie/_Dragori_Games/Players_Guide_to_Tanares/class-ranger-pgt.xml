        <text>Arcane spellcasters are known to inspire fear with their formidable and unpredictable magic, but some rangers have taken up the mantle of Arcane Guardians to counter this threat. Trained by prestigious noble houses, arcane schools, or remote temples, these elite warriors are experts in suppressing and punishing the misuse of magic and eliminating magical creatures that wreak havoc on the lives of the common folk.
	Arcane Guardians are not your typical rangers. They possess knowledge of both wizard spells and ranger spells, granting them a powerful advantage in combating magical dangers. They have honed their skills in magic manipulation and resistance, and have learned to draw upon their inner reserves to unleash spells that surpass their normal capabilities. Their weapons are imbued with mystical energy that disrupts the magic of their foes, causing immense pain with each strike.
	Many Arcane Guardians are created through alchemical processes or magic rituals, either voluntarily to protect their people or through forced experimentation. Regardless of their origin, they possess a versatility that sets them apart from other rangers, including access to more aggressive spells. Whether hunting specific creatures or patrolling as protectors against megalomaniacal spellcasters and dangerous magical artifacts, Arcane Guardians are always ready to face the unknown and defend the innocent from the perils of magic. These fearless warriors embody the true spirit of a ranger, fearlessly facing danger and steadfastly defending civilization.

Arcane Guardian in Tanares:
	In Tanares, magic is as revered as it is feared. It has brought both marvels and disasters, such as the downfall of the once-prosperous Mystical Kingdom, which was destroyed by a Malrokian Curse. Society's fear of magic and mages led Emperor Baleroth to dedicate resources towards controlling and restricting the use of arcane powers.
	To protect the Tanarean Empire from magical threats, special groups were created to study and combat arcane magic. These Arcane Guardians underwent rigorous training and mystical experiments to hone their sensitivity to magical energies and track them. Many of them harbor a deep-seated hatred for the indiscriminate use of magic, either due to the Empire's manipulative training or because of the atrocities they suffered during their training. Regardless of their motivations, they treat magic users with suspicion and instability.
	Over time, some of these soldiers discovered that not all of the targets they hunted were truly dangerous conjurers. Many were merely political pawns, leading some Guardians to question their orders and seek a way out of the Imperial forces. Those who managed to desert and survive became mercenaries, adventurers, or reclusive hermits, always evading the reach of the Empire's agents.
	With the formation of the Magocracy of Mage Tower, many of these previously hidden rangers were invited to join a special force of arcane combatants, serving as part of the Magocracy's guard and army. Others took advantage of the Empire's diminished influence to live freely in the Republic or other nations beyond its reach.

        <text>The rapid spread of the penumbral threat has caused widespread fear and unease in populated areas, particularly in urban centers where these creatures can more easily blend in and corrupt individuals. In response, the Shadow Investigator has emerged, possessing the skills and intuition necessary to swiftly detect and eliminate these malevolent beings.
	Through their extensive network of connections and their keen senses, the Shadow Investigator gathers information, analyzes affected locations, and identifies their targets with precision. Their mastery of the enemy and their tactics, honed through extensive training in fighting the penumbral threat, allows for efficient and effective operations. Whether it's hunting down penumbral creatures or targeting sinister cultists, the Shadow Investigator is determined to root out evil at its source.
	Despite their unconventional methods, the Shadow Investigator remains a critical component in the ongoing struggle against the penumbral menace. They keep their knowledge close to the vest, sharing it only with trusted pupils or assistants, but their mastery of the enemy and their tactics make them an indispensable force in the fight. Though their methods may engender distrust or fear among the general population, the Shadow Investigator is a necessary presence in the ongoing battle against the penumbral threat.

In Other Settings:
The Shadow Investigator subclass can be an excellent addition to any setting, providing a great asset to any group with their skills in detecting and eliminating malevolent creatures or individuals.
	Although the Shadow Investigator's skills were honed for detecting and fighting penumbral creatures in Tanares, they can be adapted to track and eliminate any creature that threatens the safety of a town or city. Their unorthodox methods and social outcast status may cause distrust or fear among the population, but their dedication to rooting out evil at its source is paramount to keeping people safe.
	Whether in a high-fantasy or low-fantasy setting, Shadow Investigators can be employed to track and eliminate a wide range of creatures. For example, in a high-fantasy setting, they could track and eliminate evil wizards and magical creatures, while in a low-fantasy setting, they could hunt down thieves and other criminals that threaten the safety of a town or city. Shadow Investigators can be changed to be trained to track any creature that permeates human society and stalks the night, such as vampires, ghouls, doppelgangers, demons, and devils.
	The Shadow Investigator is a social outcast detective or monster hunter that walks in the shadows to track and remove the evil creatures that stalk at night. Players should discuss with their GM the most interesting creature types to track and eliminate for their campaign. With their unique set of skills and abilities, Shadow Investigators are an adaptable subclass that can be integrated into any campaign.
