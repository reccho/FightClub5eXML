You grant an elemental enhancement to a willing creature within range of the spell, giving it advantage on all ability checks of a single ability of your choice. As a bonus action, if the target is within range of the spell, you can switch the chosen ability or switch the target of the spell to another willing creature, if both are within range of the spell and within 30 feet of each other.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a 3rd-level spell slot or higher, you can choose an additional target for each level above 2nd. When using the bonus action to change the chosen ability, you change the ability bonus for all creatures and you can only use the bonus action to switch a single target at a time.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge affects a 20-foot line that is 5 feet wide and deals 2d6 fire damage plus 1d6 fire damage for each slot level above 2nd.

You attempt to disrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell, converting its magical power into healing droplets. If the spell being cast is 5th level or lower, it fails and has no effect. If it is 6th level or higher, you must make a spellcasting ability check. The DC equals 10 plus the level of the spell being cast. On a successful check, the spell fails.
	If the target's spell fails, you can choose to absorb the energy from the interrupted spell, gaining temporary hit points equal to the spell's level that lasts for 1 minute, or copy it, casting the spell immediately as if you were the original caster, and without requiring any material components.

You create a gaseous copy of yourself in an empty space beside you. This copy is indistinguishable from you, even by magical means or abilities such as true sight. The copy has the same stats as you, except for its hit points, as the copy disappears and the spell immediately ends if it takes any damage. The copy has its own turn, which can be immediately before or after your turn. You command what it does (actions, bonus actions, reactions, movement, etc.). It has no resources of its own, such as ammunition, ability uses, or spell slots, so every time it uses something that costs a resource, it uses the resources that you have. For example, if the copy casts a spell, it consumes one of your spell slots as though you had cast the spell yourself. The same principle applies to the use of potions, scrolls, and similar items.
	When you are targeted by an attack, spell, or ability that would damage you, you can instantly switch positions with the copy, which must be within 120 feet of you, so it takes the damage and other effects in your place, causing this spell to end automatically. If the damage dealt to the copy comes from a melee attack, the attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw, becoming stunned for 1 minute on a failure. A creature stunned in this way can make the save again at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on a success. You and your copy cannot be more than 120 feet apart, if that happens the spell ends automatically and the copy disappears.

A creature can discern the illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

	• Move an object (up to 20 pounds) up to 30 feet through the air.

	• Conceal shallow tracks or footprints by moving dirt around.

As you cast the spell, the gem used as a material component is consumed to bring visions of the target's ancestors, blending them with the target's memories and unlocking new potential within the individual. However, some of the target's memories are lost in the process. The target may choose to change any or all of their subclass, feats, or features, provided they meet the prerequisites for the chosen options. Certain abilities that require additional resources, such as gold, experience points, or training, cannot be chosen unless the target possesses the necessary resources at the time of casting.
	Once the spell is complete, the chosen options are permanent, and they cannot be altered by this spell or similar effects again. The GM may impose restrictions or penalties to reflect the significant impact of the decision.

You create eight plates of pure beryl at points within range of the spell. Each beryl plate is 6 inches thick and 10 feet tall by 10 feet wide. You can distribute the plates in any way you choose within range.
	The plates are perfect squares and can be placed in any position (horizontal or vertical). Any adjacent slabs merge with each other, and each plate can act as a foundation for another, allowing for continuous constructions in any direction, such as bridges or ramps, as long as at least one of the plates is anchored to the earth to be stable.
	A plate cannot occupy the space of a creature or object. If a plate appears in a location occupied by a creature, it is pushed to any side of your choice. If you try to trap a creature between the plates, the creature can make a Dexterity saving throw and position itself outside on a success.
	Each plate has an AC of 16 and 180 hit points, disappearing magically if reduced to 0, possibly causing the collapse of adjacent plates at the GM's discretion.
	As a bonus action, you can dispense the plates at any time during the spell. If you maintain concentration for the entire duration of the spell, you can choose to keep the plates permanently, but they will turn into plates of slightly greenish rock, without any value other than stone. If you choose not to keep the plates permanently or lose concentration before the end of the spell, the plates disappear magically without a trace.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can create two more slabs for each slot level above 5th.

You cast a small spark at a point within range and then it explodes into a wave of confusion in a 10-foot-radius sphere. All creatures in the area must make a Wisdom saving throw or become extremely disoriented on a failure.
	An affected target can't take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.
	At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.

Confusion Behavior:
d10 | Behavior
1 | The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn't take an action this turn.
2-6 | The creature doesn't move or take actions this turn.
7-8 | The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.
9-10 | The creature can act and move normally.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the confusion wave increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th.

Hostile creatures within the area that make an attack or saving throw must roll 1d4 and subtract the value from the roll.

You fill your mind with the calm that only water can achieve. For the duration, you become immune to psychic damage, any effect that may sense emotions or read thoughts, divination spells and the charmed and frightened conditions. Optionally, you can transform the effect into an aura, affecting willing creatures of your choice within 20 feet of you, but you must concentrate to maintain the spell in this way. In this option, the spell will last only until the start of your next turn, ending sooner if you lose concentration.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge affects a 30-foot radius sphere centered on you and deals 12d6 cold damage.

You choose a point on the ground within range and then a large rune appears there, emitting a cylindrical mystical barrier with a 10-foot radius and 30 feet in height. No spell of 5th level or lower cast outside the barrier affects creatures or objects within it, even if cast at higher levels. Creatures within the area can be targeted by spells, but do not suffer their effects, and area spells have their effects suppressed within the cylinder.
	You can also, as a reaction, deflect a spell of 3rd level or lower cast against a target within the barrier. Then you choose another creature within range but outside the area to be the target. If you do so, the spell ends.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a slot of 7th level or higher, you block spells of up to 6th level and can deflect a spell of up to 4th level.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge affects a 30-foot cone and deals 10d6 acid damage plus 1d6 acid damage for each slot level above 6th.

You point to a creature within range and place a magical command in its mind. The command forces the creature to perform some task or abstain from some action or to take a course of activity as you decide. The creature must understand you to be affected, and if it does, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. Whenever the charmed creature takes actions against its will, it takes 1 level of exhaustion, but no more than 1 level per day. A creature that doesn't understand you is immune to this spell.
	You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. If you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.
	You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A remove curse, greater restoration, or wish spell also ends it.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a 7th-level or 8th-level spell slot, the duration is 1 year. When you cast this spell using a 9th-level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells mentioned above.

You create an illusion of an object, creature, or other visible phenomenon as if you had cast the major image spell. But when the image is attacked or comes into contact with a creature, it explodes into a burst of air affecting a 20-foot radius sphere. Creatures in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they take 3d8 thunder damage, are deafened, and are thrown 80 feet in the opposite direction of the explosion. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw takes half damage, is not deafened, and is thrown 20 feet.
	A deafened creature must make a Constitution saving throw at the start of their turn, ending the deafened condition on a success. A thrown creature that has their movement impeded takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet they are unable to move. If they are obstructed by another creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking the same damage on a failed save or no damage on a success.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge affects a 40-foot line that is 5 feet wide and deals 11d6 thunder damage.

You conjure an earth guardian, with the same appearance as the figurine used, that emerges from the ground in an empty 10-foot cube. Use the stat block of an earth elemental to characterize the guardian, which will remain for the duration of the spell or until reduced to 0 hit points, disappearing magically when the spell ends.
	The guardian obeys you to the best of its ability and acts after you in the initiative order. You can give simple courseof-action commands, such as attacking a target or running in a direction, as a free action. If you want to give a command the size of a phrase, you must spend a bonus action. If you lose concentration, the guardian will continue to follow the last command until completed. If the guardian completes the action and cannot hear or obtain new commands, it will use the Dodge action and preserve itself as best as possible.
	You can use an action to regain concentration on this spell a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge infuses your guardian with energy, allowing it to use an action to cast the elemental surge cantrip as if it were you, only once during the spell's duration, dealing 5d6 acid damage.

You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell, turning the magic power into healing droplets. If the creature is casting a spell of 4th level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 5th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect.
	If this effect causes a spell to fail, a creature within range regains a number of hit points equal to 2d8 per spell's level.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell with a spell slot of 8th level or higher, you can automatically cancel a 5th-level spell slot per level above 7th.

Circles of hot and dry winds surround the targeted creature of this spell, creating a strong wind area with a 10-foot radius around it, granting a +2 bonus to AC and imposing disadvantage on ranged attack rolls made against it. Hostile creatures that start their turn or enter the area must make a Strength saving throw or be pushed out of the area on a failed save.
	During the target's turn, it can use a bonus action to make a ranged spell attack against a creature within 30 feet. If the attack hits, it deals 1d12 bludgeoning damage, and the attacked target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is pushed back 20 feet and fall prone; on a success, it is pushed back 10 feet and remain standing. If there is an obstacle in the way of the pushed creature, it takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was pushed, and if the obstacle is another creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it takes the same damage and also fall prone.
	In addition, if a creature is targeted by an attack and the attacker or the target is within 30 feet of the area of this spell, the target can take a reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack by sending a gust of wind towards it.

You touch a creature, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. The cursed creature feels terrible pain as if it were being burned. Every time you deal damage to the cursed creature, it takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. Additionally, at the start of its turns, the cursed creature must make a Constitution saving throw, and on a failure, the creature feels intense pain and wastes its action of that turn doing nothing.

You summon the power of wind to protect yourself, preventing damage and even deflecting attacks. For the duration, damage from ranged attacks against you is reduced by an amount equal to 5 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier. If the damage is reduced to 0, you can take a reaction to deflect the attack toward another target within the original range of the attack. When deflecting, you make a ranged spell attack against the new target, applying the original damage to it on a hit.

You create a magical sword made of pure diamond that rises from the ground. You and any creature who wields the sword are considered proficient with it. The sword's blade is incredibly sharp and is considered to be made of adamantine for damage reduction. In addition, it grants the creature who wields it a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls, and any natural roll of 19 or 20 is considered a critical hit.

The shield has 1d10+10 hit points and provides cover to you and any creatures directly behind it. If the shield hit points reaches 0 it is destroyed, ending the spell.
	While the spell is active, as a bonus action, you can move the shield up to 20 feet in any direction, and even shift it's orientation between vertical and horizontal, but you must remain within 30 feet of it or the spell will end. The shield will block any physical attacks or spells that would pass through it, as any solid barrier, but will not protect against area-of-effect spells or attacks that bypass physical objects.
	In addition, the shield may be used to carry objects up to 50 pounds or activate traps.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the shield's hit points increase by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.

Sleep Breath: You exhale a sleep-inducing gas in a 60-foot cone. Creatures in the area must make a Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 minutes. This effect ends if the creature takes damage or another creature uses an action to wake it.

If you have used the sleep breath, you can do a 8d6 fire damage breath, which does not awaken affected creatures.

You alter the gravity around up to six creatures of your choice within a 40-foot square within range. Each creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be affected by the spell for the duration.
	An affected creature has difficulty moving and suffers a penalty of -2 to its AC and to its Dexterity and Strength saving throws. Its movement and actions are limited (see below), allowing it to use only half of its movement and only an action or a bonus action on the same turn. The creature cannot maintain concentration on spells and if it attempts to cast a spell, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw; otherwise, the spell fails.

Limited Actions: The targets of the spell have limited but not prevented actions. If a creature wants to take a reaction, or use both its action and bonus action, or use its entire movement, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a success, it can use the chosen option as usual but suffers one level of exhaustion. On a failure, the creature only performs what this spell allows and suffers one level of exhaustion from the effort.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge deals 3d6 acid damage, and if it hits a creature under the effect of earth embrace, it takes double damage.

You can telepathically command the construct to perform simple tasks, such as carrying an object weighing up to 20 pounds. Note that the construct cannot make attacks and will dissolve after 10 minutes or when its hit points are reduced to 0.

	A trapped creature can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the creature accumulates 3 successes, it is freed, but is banished back to its original plane of existence. If it fails 3 times (including the initial one), the creature will remain trapped until it is released by another creature.
	A creature trapped for less than 1001 days that is unearthed exits the state of suspended animation and returns to its plane. A creature that has been trapped for more than 1001 days, when unearthed, is freed from the effects of the spell, but if it dies on the Material Plane within the next 1001 years, it will die permanently and not return to its plane of origin. After these subsequent 1001 days, the creature is free of any effects of this spell. You can release a trapped creature at any time with an action, as long as you are on the same plane of existence.

You make the entire ground tremble in a 60-foot radius centered on you. A number of creatures of your choice, equal to your Wisdom modifier, that you can see within range, are swallowed by the ground, falling into a huge earth maze. Each of the creatures is sent to a different maze, so they can't find each other. To escape the maze, the creature must accumulate 3 successes in Wisdom checks, each of which must be made with their action at the beginning of their next turns. The DC of the Wisdom checks is equal to your spell save DC. For each failure, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage from small cave-ins in the tunnels. A minotaur or other creature with the Labyrinthine Recall special trait (or a similar one) automatically succeeds on this check.

When you touch a silk scarf to a surface of rock or earth, you create a shelter for up to eight people. The entrance marked by the scarf can only be seen by those you designate and is invisible to others. Inside the 20-foot cube shelter is dry, has a comfortable climate, and a small crystal provides illumination that can be turned on or off with a word from anyone chosen. At the end of the spell, you can cast it again to maintain the same shelter, otherwise the spell ends. You can use an action to end the spell at any time, and when the spell ends, the void created fills and expels anything inside it out of it. The volume of available rock or earth must be compatible with the size of the shelter created, otherwise the spell fails.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge imbue the entrance with elemental energy, so that once during the spell's duration, when an undesired person enters the earth shelter, they must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 5d6 acid damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.

You ignite the flames of rage in a creature you can see within range, forcing the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, for the duration of the spell, the creature becomes frenzied and will always attack its nearest creature. If there are no creatures within reach, the affected creature will spend its entire turn moving to the nearest creature. The affected creature is also immune to the frightened and charmed conditions and cannot use spells or any spellcasting abilities, only making armed and unarmed attacks. Additionally, all of its attack rolls will have advantage, but all attack rolls against the affected creature will also have advantage.
	The affected creature can make a new saving throw at the beginning of its turns to break free of the effect on a success. If it has taken any damage since the end of its last turn, it will make the save with disadvantage.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge creates a burst, which affects a 10-foot radius circle centered on you and deals 5d6 fire damage.

    <text>With an action, you release pure elemental energy from your hands in a 15-foot cone. You deal 1d6 damage of your primary elemental type, as shown on the table below. All creatures within the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking only half damage on a successful save.
	You can also focus all energy on a ray. In this case, you make a ranged spell attack with a range of 60 feet and deal the same damage that it would deal in a cone (or other shapes),
even if empowered by Elemental Flux:

Cantrip Upgrade: This spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

Primary Elemental Types:
Primary Element | Damage Type
Air | Thunder
Earth | Acid
Fire | Fire
Water | Cold

At Higher Levels: With this special cantrip, you can expend one of your spell slots to increase the damage it deals. The extra damage added depends on the level of the spell slot used, as shown on the table below. If you use a spell slot of 4th-level or higher, the range of the spell's area of effect doubles (30-foot cone) and if you use a 7th-level or higher spell slot, the range triples (45-foot cone).

You commune with the element of air, and it answers your call. You can determine how the winds of up to 5 miles will behave, accelerating or stopping them. Each round that you accelerate or stop the winds, the winds in the area increase or decrease one stage on the Wind table:

Ether Confluence:
Wind Stage | Condition
1 | Calm
2 | Moderate wind
3 | Strong wind
4 | Gale
5 | Storm

In addition, as a bonus action, you can cause a strong gust of wind to blow in a direction of your choosing, affecting a 120 square feet area. Any creatures that start their turn or enter the area must make a Strength saving throw or be pushed 40 feet in the direction of the wind and be knocked prone. A creature whose movement is impeded by obstructed spaces, such as walls or objects two size categories larger, takes 1d6 damage for every 10 feet it moved before having its movement impeded. If you choose to have the wind blow against the ground or a creature that cannot move due to a wall or other obstructed space caused by large or larger objects, a creature that fails the saving throw is knocked prone and restrained until the beginning of its next turn.

You manipulate the earth, opening a fissure within range, starting at a point you can see. The fissure occupies a line 50 feet long and 10 feet wide. Within the line, a chasm opens up to a depth of 20 feet, and creatures within the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they fall into the chasm.

On a success, they can use their full movement to try to climb out, ending the condition when they leave the fissure, but for every 1 foot of movement required, they must spend an additional 1 foot, emerging in an adjacent space to the fissure if the movement is sufficient. On a failure, they cannot move. At the start of the next turn after the fissure is closed, it is fully sealed, and all creatures still inside it are incapacitated and have their movement reduced to 0. Creatures with burrowing movement are immune to the effects of closing the fissure. The fissure closes automatically at the end of the spell or if you lose concentration.

Elemental Flux: With your next elemental surge, you stomp the ground. All creatures in a 20-foot radius circle centered on you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 10d6 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.

You cause your body to alter its composition, becoming a flaming form, but without changing your AC. Anything you are carrying, of your choice, shifts along with your body and you gain the following characteristics:

	• You can pass through spaces as small as an inch, but moving 1 foot costs 2 feet of speed;

	• You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet;

	• Creatures that touch you, make a melee attack against you, start or enter a space within 5 feet of you, take 1d10 fire damage;

	• You become immune to fire and poison damage, resistant to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage from non magical attacks, and immune to the grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, and restrained conditions;

	• Your unarmed and weapon attacks deal an extra 2d10 fire damage.

	• You have advantage on Intelligence and Wisdom saving throws and ability checks.

At any time, as a bonus action, you can end the spell, returning your body and everything you are carrying to its normal state.

You ignite your spirit with flames, emitting an aura that generates adoration or fear in a specific type of creature around you. You choose a type of intelligent creature as the target of this spell, and all of those within range are affected according to the chosen aura as follows:

Frightful Aura: This aura causes the chosen creatures within range to feel fear. Each creature of the chosen type that starts its turn or enters the aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for the duration of the spell. A creature that succeeds the saving throw is immune to the effect for 1 minute. While frightened, the creature uses its movement to reach the safest place possible where it cannot see you and is out of range. When it is out of range and can no longer see you, the creature is no longer frightened. If the creature re-enters the range or can see you again, it becomes frightened once more. Whenever a creature takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Adoration Aura: This aura causes all chosen creatures within range to adore you as a revered entity. Each creature of the chosen type that starts its turn or enters the aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the spell's duration. A creature that succeeds the saving throw is immune to the effect for 1 minute. A charmed creature approaches you as closely as possible and will adore you in the best way its culture or customs would venerate a figure of respect, as determined by the GM. Whenever a creature can no longer see you and is more than 60 feet away from you, it is free from the effect, but will become affected again if it sees you or is within 60 feet of you once more. If a creature takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

All creatures you choose within the spell's range and that can see you must make a Charisma saving throw. A target automatically succeeds the saving throw if it is immune to the frightened condition. On a failure, the target is affected by the spell. Until the end of the spell's duration, you can, as a bonus action, specify a location that is not occupied by a creature where the creatures will believe that blazing flames are erupting, emitting extreme heat. At the start of their turns, each affected target within 30 feet of the chosen point must move away from the heat source at all its speed before taking any other actions. A creature that is forced to move by this effect may repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn, freeing itself from the effect on a success. A creature that does not move for any reason remains frightened until it moves away. A creature will not walk to a location that is obviously a mortal danger, such as a cliff, but it may provoke opportunity attacks during its movements.

You amplify the flames of leadership within you. For the duration of the spell, you have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion, Deception, and Intimidation) checks. Once during the spell's duration, you can give a one-word simple command to a creature within 60 feet, which must make a Wisdom saving throw, following the command on a failure. The command has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn't understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it. After following the command, all other effects of the spell end. Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the GM determines how the target behaves. If the target can't follow your command, the spell ends.

Approach: The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.

Drop: The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.

Flee: The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.

Grovel: The target falls prone and then ends its turn.

Halt: The target doesn't move and takes no actions. A flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain in the air.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a 4th-level spell slot or higher, for the duration of the spell, you gain an extra use of the command for every 2 slot levels above 2nd that you use. The bonus to ability checks granted by this spell only ends when the last use of the command is used.

You focus the energy of an area spell or effect that deals damage onto a single creature of your choice that was originally targeted by that spell or effect. The chosen creature must be within range of the spell or effect, and you must have a clear line of sight to it.
	The chosen creature takes an additional 1d6 damage of the same type as the original spell or effect, and the DC of any saving throws it makes against the spell or effect increases by 2.
	For example, if a fireball is about to detonate in a 20-foot radius around you and other creatures, you can use focused blast to redirect the full force of the fireball only to that creature. The target makes its saving throw as usual, but the original DC is increased by 2. If it fails, it takes an additional 1d6 of fire damage.
	You must have a clear line of sight to both the caster and the chosen creature. If you do not have a clear line of sight to either of these, the spell fails. This spell does not allow you to target a creature that was not in the original affected area.

You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 5-foot cube. This image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. Only one chosen creature can sense this image and it seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can't create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature.
	As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.
	Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation)
check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.

You alter the target's body composition, turning it into a living granite statue. The shape of the granite body is similar to the original form, being composed purely of granite and gaining the following characteristics:

	• Its AC becomes 17 + Constitution modifier and cannot be lowered to less than 17;

	• It becomes immune to poison damage, and resistant to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage and immune to the poisoned, paralyzed, and petrified conditions;

	• It gains tremorsense of 60 feet;

	• It gains claws capable of digging through non-magical and unworked stone and earth, with a burrowing speed equal to its walking speed;

	• Its unarmed strikes now deal 2d10 + Strength modifier bludgeoning damage and are considered magical;

	• It has advantage on Strength and Constitution ability checks and saving throws.

While it remains motionless, the target is indistinguishable from an ordinary statue.

You greatly increase the effect of gravity on a creature that you can see within range. The target creature is not prevented from taking actions, but using its movement, an action, or a bonus action requires a herculean effort, causing the creature to take 2d12 force damage and suffer one level of exhaustion for each action taken. In addition, attacks that deal bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage deal double damage to the creature.
	For the duration of the spell, at the start of each turn, the target creature may make a Strength saving throw, and if successful, it is free from the effects of the spell for that turn, but it still retains all exhaustion levels gained from previous failures. If the target's Strength score is 10 or less, it automatically fails the saving throw.

You stomp the ground with incredible force, creating a massive shockwave that travels through the earth. Each creature in contact with the ground and within a 90-foot cone from you is pushed back in the opposite direction from you. They are pushed away until they leave the area of the spell.
	Each creature that is moved in this way must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they fall prone and take 1d8 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet they were pushed away. Creatures that succeed on the saving throw take half damage and are not knocked prone, but still are pushed away from you.

Elemental Flux: With your next elemental surge, you stomp the ground. All creatures in a 30-foot radius circle centered on you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw taking 11d6 bludgeoning damage and being knocked prone on a failed save.

You alter the appearance of a number of willing creatures equal to your Wisdom modifier, all of which must be within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. You decide how they look, including height, weight, facial features, tone of voice, hair length, coloring, and distinctive features, if any. They can resemble a member of another species, although none of their statistics change, but you can choose one racial trait to grant to the transformed creatures. They also cannot resemble a creature of a different size, and their basic shape remains the same; if you are bipedal, you cannot use this spell to become quadrupedal, for example. At any time during the spell's duration, the affected creature can use its action to revert its appearance to normal, ending the effect on it.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.

Upon casting this spell, your eyes glow with an eerie light. At the start of each of your turns, you may choose any number of creatures you can see. Each one must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you. A creature frightened in this way must use its actions to move as far away from you as possible via the safest available route, unless it can't move. If it moves to a spot that is at least 60 feet away from you, it is no longer frightened. If the creature can't move, it must make another Wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn. On a failed save, it falls unconscious until it takes damage or until someone uses an action to awake it. A creature that was already frightened by this spell and is targeted again, it makes the saving throw with advantage.

	While frightened by this spell, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.

You can accelerate the wind to create a tornado that affects a cylinder with a 60-foot radius and 200-foot height centered on a point of your choice within range. Creatures that start their turn or enter the area, except for the caster and three creatures of their choice, must make a Strength saving throw or be sucked into the tornado.
	Flying creatures in the area must make the Strength saving throw with disadvantage, and flying creatures within 30 feet of the tornado must make a Strength saving throw to avoid being sucked into it. Unattended objects and items are also sucked into the tornado. Flying creatures can make another Strength saving throw, with disadvantage, at the beginning of their turn, freeing themselves from the effects until the start of their next turn.
	Creatures that are sucked into the tornado are pulled towards the center of the cylinder and lifted 40 feet in the air each turn. They are trapped in the tornado for the duration, considered incapacitated with a speed of 0.
	Buildings in the area take 20 points of bludgeoning damage at the start of your turns. If their hit points are reduced to 0, they are turned into debris and also sucked into the tornado.
	When the spell ends, each creature and object that was caught in the tornado is thrown 100 feet away in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face.
	If a creature is thrown in the same direction as debris from a building, it must make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid being crushed under the rubble. A creature hit by debris takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage.

You carefully create a powerful glyph on a surface, which can be a wall, table, throne, book cover, shield, etc., as long as it has a surface area of 1 foot in diameter. If you choose a surface that conceals the glyph, the spell will not take effect.
	The glyph is apparent and bright and clearly magical. While you cast the spell, you must set a trigger that you desire for the glyph's effect, such as touching or stepping on the glyph or the approach of a certain type of creature within 5 feet of it.
	When the glyph is activated, choose one of the following effects:

Disintegration: The glyph destroys the object or location where it was placed, heating it to the point of disintegrating everything within a 10-foot radius around it. A creature that touches the object or is in the area being disintegrated must make a Constitution saving throw, reducing its hit points to 0 and turning to dust on a failure or taking 6d8 radiant damage and 6d8 fire damage on a success.

Self-Destruction: The glyph self-destructs in a powerful explosion. All creatures within a 60-foot radius must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 40d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Eternal Heat: The glyph emits a lot of heat. For the next 1001 days, any creature that starts its turn or enters a space within 30 feet of the glyph takes 4d8 fire damage, and creatures that are beyond these 30 feet but within 60 feet of the glyph must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d8 fire damage on a failure.

The creature cannot have been dead for more than 10 days and revives with 1 hit point, free of any curses or conditions (except for exhaustion, which only recovers 1 level) that affected it at the time of its death. This spell does not restore lost parts and does not affect undead or constructs, or creatures whose soul does not want to resurrect, or creatures that have died from old age.

Elemental Flux: You can imbue your next elemental surge into the revived creature, which gains 5d8 temporary hit points lasting for 8 hours.

You forge a powerful connection between two willing creatures of your choice within range, causing them to instantly swap their current hit points and maximum hit points. If a creature's hit points drop to 0 as a result of the swap, that creature falls unconscious and begins dying.
	In addition to the hit point swap, the two creatures can choose to exchange any of the following effects, provided both creatures agree:

Condition Swap: Choose one of the following conditions: blinded, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, or stunned. If one of the creatures is currently affected by the chosen condition, that creature is cured of the condition and the other creature becomes affected by it. This exchange lasts until the spell ends, at which point the conditions return to the originally affected creature.

Skill Swap: The two creatures choose one skill, tool, or language proficiency each and exchange the chosen proficiency for the duration of the spell.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration of the condition swap and skill swap increases by 1 extra hour for each slot level above 3rd.

Elemental Flux: If used for the duration of the spell, but before any other spell is cast, your next elemental surge deals 5d6 cold damage or grants 5d6 temporary hit points to creatures of your choice within the area of effect.

You synchronize the energy fluids of 4 willing creatures, which you can see within range, to heal them. You can transfer any amount of hit points between them, as long as each one has at least 1 hit point and does not exceed their maximum hit points. At the end of the synchronization (hit point transfer), you heal an additional 2d8 hit points from each of the creatures that have transferred hit points (taken damage or regained hit points). Undead and constructs are not affected by this spell.

You energize a target creature, forcing it to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes restrained and vulnerable to lightning damage for the duration of the spell. The restrained creature can use an action to make another Constitution saving throw, and if it succeeds, it breaks free from the restraint.

	• They have advantage on Dexterity and Strength saving throws.

You gain the ability to teleport up to your speed, but every 5 feet of distance teleported spends 5 feet of your speed for the current turn (you must have at least 10 feet of movement remaining for the spell to work). You must teleport to a destination within your line of sight. For example, you could teleport to the top of a wall, but not to a point in mid-air unless you have a means of flight. When you teleport, you leave behind a trail of lightning that damages any creatures in its path.
	All creatures in a line between your starting point and your destination must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take 5d8 lightning damage. On a successful save, they take half as much damage.

You weave together strands of lightning into an invisible tunnel that can be up to 120 feet long and 5 feet in diameter. The tunnel remains stationary once created and lasts for the duration of the spell.
	Each round, the first creature or object that enters one end of the tunnel becomes an invisible and silent electrical charge that instantly travels through the tunnel to the other end, reforming in its original form. Creatures and objects that pass through the sides of the tunnel take no damage and are unaffected by the spell.
	However, when a creature is transported through the tunnel, any other creatures standing inside the tunnel's area take 2d6 lightning damage as the energy arcs through them. This damage has no visible source, and creatures that are transported through the tunnel are immune to it.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the length of the tunnel increases by 30 feet and the diameter increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 3rd.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge affects a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide and deals 5d6 acid damage plus 1d6 acid damage for each slot level above 3rd.

You create a barrier that looks like a net of pure energy. The barrier does not need to be sustained and can float in the air. It occupies an area of 60 feet in length, 20 feet in height, and one inch in thickness. Any creature within the area where the barrier was created must make a Strength saving throw, suffering 3d8 lightning damage on a failure and being thrown 10 feet in a direction of your choice. On a successful save, the target takes only half the damage and is expelled into the nearest free space, as chosen by the affected creature.
	The barrier magnetically affects an area of 15 feet around it. Inside this area, attacks made with metal weapons have disadvantage, and creatures made of metal or wearing metal armor move at half speed (moving 1 foot costs 2 feet of speed).
	A creature can attempt to pass through the barrier but must succeed on a Strength saving throw. On a failure, it takes 3d8 lightning damage and is thrown back 10 feet in a prone condition. On a success, it takes half damage and passes through the barrier.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge affects a 50-foot line that is 5 feet wide and deals 10d6 lightning damage.

You encase a touched creature with a barrier of lava, shielding it from attacks. For the duration, the creature is resistant to fire and cold damage. If the creature takes bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage from a creature adjacent to it, the barrier spews lava at the attacking creature, which must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d8 fire damage.
	Optionally, the creature protected by the barrier can take a reaction upon being hit by a melee attack to make the barrier explode, causing every creature within 15 feet, except itself, to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, creatures hit by the barrier take 6d8 fire damage. After using this reaction, the spell ends.

You create a magical precipitation area in a 20-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range that you can see. Creatures within the rain area gain advantage on saving throws against spells and resistance to magical damage. Additionally, any spells that are in effect on the area or on creatures of your choice that are in or enter the area are dispelled.
	Furthermore, when a spell is cast within the area or affects any space within it, you can choose to absorb the magic to fuel the precipitation. The absorbed magic has no effect, and the precipitation then heals your chosen allied creatures within the rain for an amount of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell slot used to cast the absorbed spell. The healing effect of this magic does not affect undead or constructs.

You touch an object, causing it to emit a faint glow that is imperceptible in bright light and difficult to notice in dim light conditions. The object can be any item (magical or not) of your choosing, weighing no more than 10 pounds.
	While the spell is active, you can sense the location of the object as long as it is within 240 feet of you, even if it is behind walls, doors, or other barriers. The location is communicated to you as a general sense of direction (e.g., "northwest") and distance (e.g., "close", "very far").
	You can dismiss the spell at any time as a bonus action, causing the glow to fade immediately.
	The DC to notice the glow is equal to your spell save DC. Only a creature specifically looking for the glow can use its action to make a Wisdom (Perception) check against this DC to notice the glow. The object can be hidden inside fabrics or other objects, making it impossible to directly see the glow, without hindering your ability to sense its location.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the weight limit of the object increases by 10 pounds for each slot level above 1st.

The magma servant will obey your commands to the best of its ability. You can give simple course of action commands, such as attacking a target or running in a direction, as a free action. If you want to give a command that requires a longer phrase, you must use a bonus action. If the creature completes the action and cannot hear or receive new commands, it will take the Dodge action to preserve itself to the best of its ability.

You surround a target creature within range with a thin layer of clean water, granting it the ability to breathe underwater and a swimming speed of 40 feet. While the spell lasts, the creature gains the following benefits:

	• Immunity to the effects of non-magical fire, gasses and liquids, including harmful acids, poisons and smokes.

	• You have advantage on saving throws made against harmful magic gasses (such as cloudkill and stinking cloud effects, and the breath weapons of some dragons).

	• Resistance to fire and acid damage.

	• Immunity to being grappled and restrained.

The water mantle continuously replenishes the water the creature breathes and is covered in, filtering out harmful substances.
	In addition, the creature can use a bonus action to end the spell and unleash a water gust attack against a creature within 60 feet. The water gust requires a ranged spell attack roll and deals 3d10 bludgeoning damage on a hit.

You magically influence, at your discretion, a number of people equal to up to three times your proficiency bonus. The creatures must be able to see and hear you clearly and the suggestion must be phrased in a way that makes the course of action reasonable. Igniting them to do something against themselves, such as self-flagellation, negates the effects of the magic.
	Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect.
	Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, they pursue the course of action you described to the best of their ability.
	For the duration of the spell, the inflamed creatures are immune to the frightened condition and will continue to carry out the proposed course of action. If the activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the target finishes what was requested.

However, the replica can only damage or affect in other ways creatures that failed the saving throw. It acts on its own turn and on its own initiative, but you can control its course of action. If the replica's hit points are reduced to 0, the spell ends, and it immediately dissipates.

	If a creature has a limb or body part covered by lava, it takes this damage at the end of its turns for the next minute or until it takes an action to remove the lava. A creature that is partially covered by lava has its speed halved and takes 4d8 fire damage for the next minute or until it takes an action to remove the lava.

You hold the piece of metal used in this spell and it disintegrates into metallic sand, swirling around a willing creature within range of the spell, granting them protection. A creature enveloped in this protection gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, is considered to have half cover, and when subjected to a Dexterity saving throw to take half damage from an effect, they take no damage on a success.
	Once during the duration, as a bonus action, you can change the target of the spell to another willing creature within range and at least 30 feet from the original target.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge affects a 40-foot line that is 5 feet wide and deals 10d6 acid damage.

You conjure a duplicate of yourself from the energy of the wind, which appears in an unoccupied space within the spell's range. The duplicate has an AC equal to yours and one hit point, and it performs saving throws and ability checks as it were you. The duplicate does not move, but any action you take can also be simulated by the duplicate at your choice. A creature can make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to realize that the duplicate is not real. The duplicate disappears if you use a bonus action to dismiss it, if you move more than 60 feet away from it, or when its hit points are reduced to 0.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge deals thunder damage, and on the damage roll, consider every 1 or 2 as a 3.

You manipulate earth and rocks to create objects within range. If using fresh earth (sand, clay, and general soils), you can create a large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot cube, or eight connected 5-foot cubes), such as statues, bridges, passages, pillars, doors, etc., as long as there is enough earth to do so. If using metal or solid rock,.you can create only a medium or smaller object (contained within a single 5-foot cube), such as a weapon, idol, crown, etc. The objects are usually solid, without gears or hinges, and generally of good quality. However, the quality of objects, such as jewelry, statues, or any that require artistic or professional knowledge, may vary depending on your proficiency or the availability of the right tools.

At Higher Levels: When you use a spell slot of 5th or 6th level, you can make a huge object of fresh earth (contained within a 15-foot cube, or twenty seven connected 5-foot cubes) or a large object of solid material (contained within a 10-foot cube, or eight connected 5-foot cubes). When you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can mold a gargantuan object of fresh earth (contained within a 20-foot cube, or four connected 10-foot cubes, or sixty-four connected 5-foot cubes).

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge affects a 20-foot line that is 5 feet wide and deals 7d6 acid damage plus 1d6 acid damage for each slot level above 4th.

    <text>Element: Water

You touch a non-magical object weighing no more than 5 pounds, causing its surface to become reflective like a mirror. During the spell's duration, the object captures all images and sounds within a 30-foot radius, as long as they are reflected on its mirrored surface.
	When the spell ends, the object reverts to its original state, and the captured images and sounds are retained, hidden within it. To access the captured images and sounds, the object must be submerged in any body of water large enough to completely cover it. Once the object is submerged, the captured images and sounds are displayed on the surface of the water and can be viewed as if you were on the location. The size of the water surface determines the size of the image, with a larger surface allowing for more details to be seen.
	The object can store the captured images and sounds for up to 1 year. However, once the object is submerged and the images and sounds are accessed, or if it is removed from the water before the end of it, the information is lost and cannot be recovered.
	The quality of the captured images and sounds depends on the quality of the object used as a mirror. Polished and well-maintained objects capture clearer and sharper images and sounds, while dirty and worn objects can produce blurred and distorted images and sounds.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the weight limit of the object increases by 5 pounds for each slot level above 2nd.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge affects a 20-foot line that is 5 feet wide and deals 2d6 cold damage plus 1d6 cold damage for each slot level above 2nd.

You deliver a powerful shoulder strike to your target. Make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the creature becomes stunned for 1 minute. On a critical hit, the primary target is violently pushed back 15 feet and can hit a creature of your choice as a secondary target, provided it's in the same direction and range as the primary target was pushed. In this case, the secondary target is also stunned. Oozes are immune to this spell.
	Each stunned target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of its turns. If they succeed, the stunned condition ends.

You discharge energy that affects the nervous system of all creatures of your choice in a 20-foot square within range. A creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw, becoming paralyzed on a failure. On a successful save, the creature's nervous system is fatigued and on its next turn, it cannot use one of its actions, be it an action, bonus action, or movement. A paralyzed creature can make another saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the condition on a success but still being affected by the action restriction on its next turn. If your concentration is broken, paralyzed creatures are released but still suffer from the action restriction. A creature that has passed the action restriction is freed from the effects of the spell.

You touch a non-magical object weighing up to 10 pounds, causing it to briefly glow with an earthy light before splitting into a number of identical copies equal to twice your proficiency bonus (minimum of 4). Each copy has the same appearance, weight, and physical properties as the original object, including any markings or inscriptions.
	However, the copies created by this spell bear an unnatural aura that makes them immediately identifiable as magical constructs to anyone who inspects them closely. As a result, it is very difficult to use these copies to deceive others or pass them off as genuine items.
	The copies created by this spell last for 1 hour or until they are destroyed, at which point they crumble into a pile of dust. You can end the spell prematurely by using a bonus action to cause one or more copies to disappear.
	The copies created by this spell are mundane objects and do not possess any magical properties. Additionally, they cannot be used to create copies of items made of precious metals or gems, as their unique physical properties cannot be replicated by this spell.

You transform a 30-foot-radius circular area, centered on a point within range, into quicksand. The area becomes difficult terrain and every creature within it at the time of casting, or that starts its turn or enters the area, must make a Strength saving throw. On the first failure, the creature begins to sink in the sand and becomes restrained. On the second failure, the restrained creature sinks even further, becoming incapacitated. On a third failure, the incapacitated creature sinks completely into the sand and becomes stunned. Each time a creature succeeds on a Strength saving throw, it regresses one step in the number of failures, becoming unburied if it reaches 0 failures.
	A creature that is completely buried by this spell cannot breathe, is under total cover, has disadvantage on Strength saving throws, and suffers 3d10 bludgeoning damage for each failure it has on Strength saving throws. Failures beyond the third are added to the number of failures.
	Another creature that is adjacent to a buried creature and is not under any effect of the spell can use an action to help dig out the buried creature. The creature must make a Strength ability check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees the creature from the spell's effects, but on a failure, it is pulled into the area of effect and counts as having failed a Strength saving throw against the spell. A creature within the area of effect that tries to help another does so with disadvantage on the Strength check.
	When the spell ends, all creatures that are restrained suffer 3d10 bludgeoning damage, all creatures that are incapacitated suffer 6d10 bludgeoning damage, and all creatures that are stunned suffer 10d10 bludgeoning damage. Objects and creatures that are dead or die from the final damage remain buried, while surviving creatures are expelled from the ground.
	Objects that are not being held are automatically buried, and structures within the area suffer 30 bludgeoning damage when the spell is cast, and at the beginning of each turn that you maintain the spell.

Elemental Flux: With your next elemental surge, you stomp the ground. All creatures in a 30-foot-radius circle centered on you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, taking 14d6 bludgeoning damage and being knocked prone on a failed save. Each creature within the quicksand area that is hit by this elemental surge fails in the saving throw automatically, counting as a failure for the spell too.

You create a large flower at a location of your choice within range that can envelop a willing creature, up to Huge size, that is within 15 feet of it. The creature is immune to damage, has its movement reduced to 0, and is incapacitated while inside the flower. The creature can leave the flower at any time. While inside the flower, the creature is healed for 2d8 + its Wisdom modifier at the start of each of its turns. The creature also removes 1 level of exhaustion every 2 turns spent inside the flower and gets rid of one curse, disease, or poison for every 4 turns spent inside it. If the creature remains inside the flower for the full duration of the spell, it regains any lost limbs.
	The flower automatically dissipates, ending the spell's effects if the creature exits it, you lose concentration, or the flower's hit points are reduced to 0. The flower has an AC of 15, 80 hit points, is resistant to non-magical damage, and immune to poison damage.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge affects a 30-foot cone and deals 11d6 poison damage and requires a Constitution saving throw.

You touch a body or a body part that still exists of a creature that has been dead for no more than 500 years. The part of the creature and any material components turn into a seed that automatically sprouts into a plant, generating a bulb where the body of the creature is recreated and restored. After 8 hours, the bulb opens, and the creature is revived, healed of all wounds, any poisons removed, all diseases cured, and freed from any curses that afflicted it when it died. The spell fully restores the body, replacing missing parts.
	If the body of the creature no longer exists, the casting time doubles, and you must speak the creature's name, take an object that belonged to it, and, as part of this spell, bring its spirit, which will be mixed with the material components when forming the seed. If the spirit is not available, the spell fails, and no components are expended.
	The spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists. The creature then appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 5 feet of the plant.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge, instead of dealing damage, imbues the creature's body with an elemental soul, leaving it immune to diseases and curses for a number of days equal to 10d6 days.

You harness a sacred water flow to reverse a loss of life in a body, resurrecting the creature. The creature cannot have been dead for more than 100 years, cannot be an undead or construct, must have a soul available for return to the body, and cannot have died of old age.
	At the end of the spell, the target creature returns to life with all wounds healed, regaining any lost limbs and free of any conditions, but it receives 4 levels of exhaustion. Additionally, the resurrected creature returns free of any non-magical diseases or curses. Magical diseases and curses will resume their effects if they are not removed beforehand.
	The flow of magic is very heavy and until a long rest is finished, you will receive two levels of exhaustion and have a -4 reduction to all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

Elemental Flux: With your next elemental surge, you imbue the creature targeted by this spell and yourself with elemental energy, granting both 6d8 temporary hit points that last for 10 hours.

You plant the seeds and grow a small, glowing plant that produces four fruits. If not harvested within 1 hour, the fruits wither and disappear. Once harvested, the fruits last for 24 hours before disappearing.
	A creature that consumes one of the fruits can remove any curses or frightened conditions from itself, and for the next 24 hours, it is sufficiently nourished, it gains 2d10 temporary hit points, becomes immune to the poisoned and frightened conditions, and has advantage on Wisdom saving throws.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you create one additional fruit for each level above 6th.

Elemental Flux: With your next elemental surge, you imbue the fruits with elemental energy. Before eating a fruit, a creature must speak a magical word. If a creature eats a fruit without speaking the word, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 7d6 poison damage and is poisoned for 24 hours. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and gains no benefits from the spell.

The magical fruit lasts for 3 days and disintegrates after this time.

A creature in the space where the pillar appears must make a Dexterity saving throw or be thrown 30 feet into the air, landing prone in an adjacent space to the pillar. If succeeded, the creature does not take damage but must choose an adjacent space to position itself.
	With a bonus action, for the next minute, you can topple the pillars in a direction of your choice, each occupying a 30-foot long and 5-foot wide line. All creatures within the line of the pillar's fall must make a Strength saving throw, taking 1d8 damage and becoming restrained on a failure. A restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC, freeing itself on a success. Huge or larger creatures are immune to this effect. If you do not topple the pillars, they will dissipate after 10 minutes.

Elemental Flux: With your next elemental surge, you stomp the ground. All creatures in a 20-foot radius circle centered on you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d6 bludgeoning damage and being knocked prone on a failed save.

You take a gem in your hand that crumbles when using the spell. When its fragments touch the ground, you generate an earthquake with a radius of 120 feet and an epicenter of your choice within range, causing the entire area of effect to become difficult terrain. At the time of casting and at the beginning of each turn of a creature within the area, it must make a Dexterity saving throw, becoming prone on a failure. Creatures that are concentrating on other spells must also make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC, losing concentration on a failure.
	Structures within the area suffer 60 bludgeoning damage when you cast the spell, and at the beginning of each of your turns that you maintain concentration. If they reach 0 hit points, they collapse and may cause damage to creatures beneath them, at the GM's discretion.
	In addition, at the GM's choice, other effects may occur, such as fissures or shifting ground. When a fissure is formed, it can have a depth of 3d4x10 feet and a width of 1d4x5 feet. Creatures in the area of the fissure must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they fall into the fissure, or choose one of the edges to remain on the surface on a success. When the ground shifts, at the GM's discretion, a block may rise or sink 1d4x10 feet, taking everything on it along and causing structures it cuts through to collapse.

Elemental Flux: With your next elemental surge, you stomp the ground. All creatures in a 30-foot-radius circle centered on you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, taking 14d6 bludgeoning damage and being knocked prone on a failed save.

	Whenever a creature attacks you in melee, your shield drains bodily fluids from the attacker, causing the creature to suffer 3d8 + your Wisdom modifier necrotic damage, and you add the same amount of temporary hit points to the pool generated by this spell.

You attempt to ignite the skin of a creature you can see within range of the spell. The target creature must have some type of skin or leather covering its body and, if so, must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, its skin or leather transforms into incandescent material like live coals. On a success, nothing happens.
	A creature with fiery skin gains resistance to fire damage and vulnerability to all other types of damage. It can move in extremely high temperature environments but suffers one point of exhaustion each turn it is in extremely cold temperatures (below 32 °F). Touching or coming into contact with this creature causes 1d6 fire damage and automatically ignites any flammable materials.
	The creature with ember skin can repeat the Constitution saving throw at the end of its turns, and if it succeeds three times, it is free from the effects. If you maintain concentration for 1 minute while the creature is under the effects of the spell, its skin will permanently be transformed into embers, making this effect permanent. This effect can be removed only by a wish or similar powerful spell.

You expel all the air from a 30-foot radius sphere centered on a point within range, and the area remains airless for the duration. All creatures within the area at the time of casting who require air to breathe must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they suffer one level of exhaustion, as the air is sucked out of their lungs.
	Furthermore, creatures inside the sphere are subject to the normal rules for suffocation. They can hold their breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + their Constitution modifier
(minimum of 30 seconds), and then survive a number of rounds equal to their Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round) before they drop to 0 hit points and begin dying.
	In addition, the airless area becomes difficult terrain for the duration of the spell, and any creature that starts its turn within the area or moves into it on its turn must make a Constitution saving throw, suffering one level of exhaustion on a failed save. Creatures within the area are considered deafened, and no sound can propagate within it.
	Additionally, creatures inside the sphere are immune to thunder damage, and no thunder damage can be caused inside the sphere.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th.

You and up to five other willing creatures within range take a step on the border of the Ethereal Plane, entering the region that overlaps with the current plane. While on the border, you can move in any direction as if you had a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can still see and hear the original plane, but everything appears grayed out and muffled, and you can't see anything beyond 60 feet.
	For the duration, as a bonus action, a creature under the effect can choose to move from the Ethereal Plane to the original plane and vice versa. The creature returns to the same mirrored location it was occupying on the plane it left (if it exits the Ethereal Plane in midair and without a flying speed, the creature will fall).
	While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by other creatures on that plane. Creatures not on the Ethereal Plane cannot perceive you or interact with you, unless a special ability, magic item, or spell has given them the ability to do so.
	You can move through objects that are not on the Ethereal Plane, ignoring any objects and effects from the plane you originated from.
	When the spell ends, you and your allies return to the plane of origin in the same location you occupied at the time. If you occupy the same space as a solid object or creature when this happens, you will immediately be moved to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you were moved.
	This spell has no effect if you cast it while on the Ethereal Plane or a plane that does not border it, such as one of the Outer Planes.

You summon up to five air spirits that take the form of beasts with a challenge rating of 1 or lower. They appear in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. A spirit disappears when it reaches 0 hit points or when the spell ends. They are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for each of them, which act on their own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you issue no commands, they defend themselves against hostile creatures, but they take no other actions. The GM can provide the statistics of the beasts.

You touch a creature, causing a collection of stones to gather and form an arm of stone that connects with the target's torso. The stone hand can hold and manipulate objects just like a regular hand, but it is not capable of attacking or performing somatic components for spells.
	The target gains the following benefits while the spell is in effect:

	• The target can wield a two-handed weapon or a versatile weapon with two hands, while still using the third hand to hold a shield or perform any other action that would normally require a free hand.

	• The target can use the third hand to hold a card or other small object in a way that is hidden from view, granting advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks made to cheat at games of chance.

	• The target can use the third hand to manipulate objects that would normally require the use of both hands, such as picking a lock or disarming a trap. If using three hands, the target gains advantage on any Dexterity checks made to interact with objects in this way.

	• The target can use the third hand to retrieve or stow an object that is normally out of reach, such as a potion on a high shelf or a weapon on the ground. The hand can reach up to 10 feet away from the target and can manipulate objects weighing up to 5 pounds. It must still use the appropriate action to do so.

	• The target can use the third hand to perform simple tasks, such as carrying a torch, holding a door open, or carrying a small object while using both of its regular hands for something else.

	• Attraction: The target feels a strong attraction to a creature or object of your choice, seeking to approach and interact with it in a non-threatening manner. This effect does not end combat, but may make the target less likely to harm or kill the object of their attraction, not putting itself in danger while doing so.

	• Anger: The target feels anger toward a creature or object of your choice, seeking to harm it or break it. In combat, if an enemy is chosen, the target may make this enemy a preferred target. The creature will not attack or do anything that would be against its principles or would endanger itself The target must make a Wisdom saving throw to resist the spell's effect. If the target fails the saving throw, they are affected by the chosen effect for the spell's duration.

You join your hands and focus, enveloping you and up to six willing creatures within 5 feet of you in a brilliant purple water. All the targets must be fully submerged in any liquid at the time of the casting, and they are teleported to another water source within 1 mile, through which you and the targets emerge. The destination is chosen by you and must be a known location.

You clap your hands, generating a 30-foot cone of thunderous shock. All creatures in the area must make a Constitution saving throw or become deafened. A creature deafened by this spell is also incapacitated. At the beginning of each turn, a deafened creature can make a Constitution saving throw to end the spell's effect on itself on a success. Undead, constructs, and creatures naturally deafened or already under the deafened condition are immune to its effects.

During the spell's duration, you can use a bonus action to analyze an area within 60 feet of you, detecting any blood drops, small objects, and weapons hidden within the area. Whenever you detect blood drops, make an Intelligence (Investigation) check to determine what you have uncovered. You learn the following information based on the results of your check:

	• 10 or more: You determine if any creature spilled blood and how many there are and their types.

	• 13 or more: You determine the severity of injuries, knowing if each creature is dead or alive.

	• 16 or more: You determine any weaknesses of the creature, if any.

In addition, for the duration of the spell, you gain advantage on your first attack each turn you make against a creature whose blood you analyzed for weaknesses, even if that creature has none.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge deals cold damage, and on the damage roll, consider any result of 1 or 2 as 3.

You unleash a burst of bubbles in a 30-foot wide, 80-foot long line, affecting all creatures within. Creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw or be engulfed in a bubble. Once trapped, a creature is considered underwater, incapacitated, and vulnerable to lightning damage. Its speed is reduced to 0, except for swimming speed. At the start of each of its turns, the trapped creature can make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice). On a successful save, it is no longer incapacitated but remains trapped inside the bubble. A creature can escape the bubble by destroying it. Each bubble has an AC of 17 and 30 hit points, is immune to acid, bludgeoning, cold, fire, lightning, poison, and psychic damage, and has resistance to non-magical slashing and piercing damage.
	Creatures outside the bubble can attack it, but if the attacker is Huge or smaller and uses a melee attack, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the attacking creature becomes trapped in another bubble that emerges from the first.
	If you lose concentration, the spell ends and all bubbles are destroyed. Creatures with a swimming speed automatically escape the bubble.

	During the casting and up to two hours after, the rain continues to lash the region, increasing about 5 cubic centimeters of water every 10 minutes of rain. The excessive amount of water will cause rivers to flood regions, entire lands to flood, and other effects from torrential rains.
	All creatures in the rain, except you, have their movement halved. Each turn a creature remains in the area, it must make a Strength (Athletics) check or become prone.
	All natural and magical fire sources up to 3rd level are extinguished and the area becomes lightly obscured for all creatures except you.

Each creature in the cone must make a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet back, take 2d4 bludgeoning damage, and fall prone. Walls and structures in the area, depending on how well-built they are, may be weakened or destroyed at the GM's discretion.

24 hours You concentrate all your control over the force of the element, causing the power of the wind to lift entire locations and relocate them to another place. The spell affects a circular area of land within range with a half mile radius and 100 feet in depth, lifting the block of land, including everything it carries above it.
	Once in motion, the block moves 30 feet per turn, uninterruptedly in the last commanded direction. With a bonus action, you can make the block start moving, change the direction of movement, or stop it.
	The block of land can only move through spaces it can fit into. If the block has its movement interrupted by an object or volume of land equal to or larger than it for more than 1 minute, the spell ends. Once the spell ends, the block descends slowly until it lands on the ground.
	Once during the spell's duration, you can grant control (concentration) to another creature that has spellcasting. You can create a block of land that levitates permanently by casting the spell on the same block for a year and, on the last day, defining a creature that will receive control over its movement without needing to concentrate or have spellcasting abilities. If the creature dies or is willing, you can change the control to another creature with a new casting of this spell.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge affects a 45-foot cone and deals 10d6 thunder damage. If cast against the levitated block of land, it takes no damage but is pushed 90 feet in a direction of your choice.

Your limbs morph into powerful claws. For the duration of the spell, you gain a burrowing speed equal to your walking speed. If you come across pure rock terrain, you can burrow at half your speed. When you burrow, you leave behind a tunnel that can only be passed through by creatures of your size or smaller.
	The claws can also be used to attack, you are considered proficient with them and they deal slashing damage equal to 1d8 plus your Strength or Dexterity modifier.

You create a volcano from a point on the ground within range. From the moment you cast the spell, a volcano begins to rise from the ground, growing in four distinct stages. Each round you maintain concentration on this spell, it produces additional effects of the next stage.

First stage: When you cast the spell, a 20-foot-radius sphere around the point you choose becomes extremely hot, and the ground becomes scorching hot. Creatures that enter or start their turn within the area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 6d8 fire damage on a failure or half as much on a success.

Second stage: The ground within the area of the first stage rises, transforming the area into difficult terrain and beginning to release toxic gasses. All creatures within the area and a further 20-foot radius must make a Constitution saving throw or become poisoned due to the toxic gasses. Additionally, the effects of the first stage increase to a 40-foot radius.

Third stage: The raised area explodes in lava, and all creatures in the 20-foot-radius sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 8d8 bludgeoning damage and 3d8 fire damage, are thrown 20 feet in the opposite direction, and become coated in lava. A creature coated in lava takes 8d8 fire damage at the start of each of its turns for the next minute, or until it is doused with 3 gallons of water or uses an action to clean itself. In addition, the area affected by the second stage increases to a further 20-foot radius, and the area affected by the first stage increases to a total of a 60-foot radius.

Fourth stage: A 20-foot-radius pool of lava forms at the center of the volcano, rising to a height of 40 feet and beginning to launch magma spheres into the surrounding area. The magma spheres strike three locations of your choice within 100 feet of the center and affect a 10-foot-radius circle. Creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 10d8 fire damage and become coated in lava on a failed save, or half as much damage and no coating on a successful save. Buildings within the affected area are destroyed, with the extent of the damage determined by the GM.

If you lose concentration on the spell, the volcano retreats, returning one stage per round, and ending after it retreats from the first stage.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge affects a sphere of a 30-foot radius centered on you. All creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 14d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

You use water to neutralize spells. With an action, you can target a creature, an object, or a magical effect within range. Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. Each spell of 4th level or higher requires you to make a Wisdom ability check (DC 10 + spell level), ending the spell on a success.
	When you cast this spell as a reaction, you can interrupt the casting of a spell, but you must still make the Wisdom ability check regardless of the spell's level, with disadvantage.

You sprinkle ruby dust over the flames, causing a barrier of pure magma to rise from the ground.

The barrier blocks the line of sight.
	When the barrier appears, every creature within its area is pushed to one side of it, as chosen by you, and must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d8 fire damage and being covered in lava on a failure, or taking half damage and not being covered in lava on a success.
	A creature that is covered in lava takes 2d8 fire damage at the end of each of its turns until it is either doused in at least 3 gallons of water or takes an action to clean itself.
	A creature can move through the barrier, but it is a painful and slow process. For every 1 foot moved, the creature must spend an additional 4 feet of movement. A creature that chooses to cross becomes covered in lava and must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 6d8 fire damage on a failure or half as much damage on a success.

You create a translucent barrier at a point within range, for the duration. The barrier floats in the air and does not require support, appearing in any position you choose, either horizontal, vertical, or angled. It has a thickness of 1 inch and you can make it semi-spherical or spherical with a radius of up to 15 feet, or flat, creating up to ten panels of 10-foot by 10-foot, which must be contiguous. If the barrier appears in a creature's space that cannot pass through it (see below),
the creature is pushed to one side of your choice.
	When creating the barrier, you can set one creature type or alignment (good, evil, chaotic, lawful) that cannot pass through the barrier. All other creatures or alignments can pass through it normally, but the chosen type cannot pass through the barrier in any way. Attacks and spells of the chosen creature type are neutralized by the barrier, which is indestructible for them, even affecting the Ethereal Plane.
	A creature that is not of the chosen type can choose not to pass through the barrier, so it can walk on the barrier as if it were solid ground, but once it does, it cannot go back on that decision.

	• You can move through spaces occupied by enemies and spaces of at least 1 inch wide without squeezing;

	• You become immune to poison and cold damage, resistant to fire, acid, bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage, and immune to the grappled, poisoned, paralyzed, petrified, restrained, and prone conditions;

	• You gain a swimming speed of 60 feet and the ability to breathe underwater;

	• You have advantage on Wisdom and Charisma ability checks and saving throws;

	• Whenever you take an Attack action, you can replace any number of your attacks with slam attacks, which are melee spell attacks with a reach of 10 feet that deal bludgeoning damage equal to 2d8 + your Wisdom modifier, and are considered magical for the purpose of damage resistance;

	• As an action, you can attempt to engulf a creature of your size or smaller within 10 feet of you. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes restrained and takes 3d10 bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns. Additionally, any bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage dealt to you before resistance is applied is split evenly between you and the engulfed creature.The engulfed creature can attempt to escape by taking an action and making a Strength saving throw. If it succeeds, it is freed and positioned in a space adjacent to you. You can only engulf one creature at a time, and when you move, any engulfed creature moves with you.

You have the power to control water in all its forms within range, creating a variety of magical effects.

	• You can alter the color and scent of up to 1 cubic foot of water, making it seem clean or dirty.

	• You can instantly chill, heat, evaporate, or freeze any liquid with a volume of up to 1 cubic foot, as long as no creatures are inside it.

	• You can create an instant and harmless sensory effect, such as the sound of rushing water, crashing waves, falling rain, a light mist, or even dampening or drying a surface. The effect must fit within a cube with a side length of 1 foot.

	• You can drain moisture from a small object or plants, such as a flower or fruit, extracting clear, potable water.

You can dismiss these effects with an action.

A creature absorbs the ambient water to restore itself. The creature regains 50 hit points at the moment of casting and an additional 50 hit points at the start of its turns until the spell ends. Additionally, if the target remains under the effect of the spell for an entire hour, the water can permanently regrow lost limbs and body parts, exactly as the original.
	If the target is in contact with a large body of water, such as lakes, rivers, and seas, the effects above are accelerated. If the target remains in contact since the end of its last turn, it regains all its hit points at the start of its next turn, and any lost limbs and other body parts are fully restored if the target remains in contact for at least 1 minute.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge affects a 45-foot cone and deals 12d6 cold damage.

Your arms are enveloped in water, forming semi-solid tentacles. While the spell remains in effect, you can freely control the tentacles, increasing your reach by 15 feet, including for touch spells, and you are able to manipulate and drag objects as if they were your own hands.
	The tentacles can be used to attack, requiring a melee spell attack to hit and dealing bludgeoning damage equal to 1d10 + your Wisdom modifier. Additionally, as a bonus action, you can grapple a creature hit, which will also be restrained until the grapple ends (the difficulty to escape equals your spell save DC). While holding a creature, you cannot use the tentacles to obtain the other benefits of this spell.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge affects a 10-foot radius circle centered on you and deals 2d6 cold damage.

You blow air and create a whirlwind that travels in a 30-foot long, 5-foot wide, and 15-foot high line, stopping at walls or solid structures. All creatures in the area, Large or smaller, must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creatures are pushed 20 feet in a direction of your choice. If their movement is obstructed by an obstacle, they suffer 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet moved.
	The gust also disperses gas or vapor, extinguishes unprotected flames, and causes protected flames, such as lanterns, to dance wildly, with a 50 percent chance to be extinguished.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge deals thunder damage, and on the damage roll, consider every 1 or 2 as a 3.

You breathe the winds of time over a creature or object, altering the temporal flow by accelerating its natural processes.
	When you cast the spell, you can choose to accelerate the aging process of the targeted creature or object by a factor of twenty, causing it to experience twenty times the normal effects of the passage of time. For example, you could cause a plant to grow to maturity in a matter of hours, accelerate the onset of a poison to take effect within seconds instead of minutes, or end a magical effect with a minimum duration of one minute instantly. This spell can age a touched creature or object by 20 days in one. If the target is a creature, it can make a Constitution saving throw to avoid this spell's effect on a success.
	Note that the spell only affects natural and mystical processes related to time, and does not affect the actions or abilities of the target. The spell can be used to affect a wide range of effects related to time, but the GM should determine the limits of the spell's effects and the potential consequences of using it in creative ways.

You create a whirlwind at a location of your choice. The point remains stationary for the duration. Whenever a creature other than you comes within 5 feet of it, that creature must make a Strength saving throw or be flung away in the direction established by you when the spell was cast. The creature is thrown 40 feet high and 20 feet away in that direction.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge deals 7d6 thunder damage.
