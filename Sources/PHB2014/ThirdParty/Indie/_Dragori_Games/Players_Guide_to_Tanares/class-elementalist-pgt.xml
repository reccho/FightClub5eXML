      <name>Elementalist</name>
      <text>In a serene garden, a wise elementalist master prepares tea for its disciples with the utmost precision, their every movement harmoniously aligned with the elements. As the tea leaves dance in the boiling water, the disciples sense a deep connection to the elements, feeling the master's power coursing through their veins.
	When confronted by ruthless bandits, a soulborn elementalist commands the elements with a flick of their wrist, unleashing an icy beam of pure energy that encases half of the bandits in a frozen tomb while the rest flee in terror.
	Against a monstrous beast, an elf elementalist stands resolute, igniting their weapons and those of their allies with blazing magic. Confidence burns within them as they prepare for an epic battle, ready to vanquish the darkness with the raw power of the elements.
	Elementalists are versatile and wise spellcasters who serve as advisors, sages, spiritual guides, and teachers. According to prophecies, they hold the power to stop Gullog and his undead armies.
	Born from an ancestral elven tradition, elementalists stand as a distinct group of spellcasters. Their mastery diverges from conventional arcane practices, delving into the harmonization of elements, energy flow, meditation, and spiritual enlightenment. These wise practitioners dedicate their lives to attuning with one of the four elements, each of which grants distinctive abilities and purpose. Fire elementalists command martial prowess and emotional control, earth elementalists foster unwavering resilience and deep moral compass, air elementalists exhibit cunning, guile, and grace of movement, while the scarce water elementalists practice healing arts, nurturing both body and soul, and advocating temperance and non-attachment. Despite mastering one element, elementalists can manipulate the other two elements that do not directly conflict with their chosen one, enabling combinations of elements to cast spells of magma, plant, lightning, and spiritual magic, and augmenting their vast repertoire.
	The elementalist's path is a lifelong odyssey built upon the master-disciple relationship. With unwavering commitment, the disciple studies, contemplates, and serves under their master, acquiring elemental wisdom and proper conduct. Years of labor and ordinary tasks precede the true awakening to the powers of Elementalism, as masters cautiously evaluate their disciples' character before bestowing such knowledge. This bond endures for life, underpinned by duty, respect, and honor. Disciples must venerate and assist their masters throughout their lives, undertaking tasks as required and ensuring their actions never tarnish their master's name. Concurrently, masters are obligated to impart wisdom, safeguard their disciples, and foster their spiritual growth, with any abuse constituting great dishonor.
	Elementalists regard their fellow practitioners as kin, despite differing principles and views among schools devoted to various elements. They engage in fervent debates, never overstepping the bounds of theological, philosophical, and metaphysical discourse. Their relationships with other magic users are intricate, often considering wizards and sorcerers untrustworthy due to their immense powers without requisite wisdom and moral enlightenment. However, those displaying tempered conduct and good character are highly esteemed. Clerics earn respect for their devotion and moral code, but their potential fanaticism incites wariness, whereas druids are perceived as kindred spirits, embracing a more primal yet venerable approach to wisdom.
	In the world of Tanares, an ominous threat looms as the immortal kemet leader, Gullog, seeks to conquer and turn all into icy death. Elementalists are at the heart of a prophecy that may provide salvation, seeing themselves as responsible for restoring the goddess Bás to her pacifist ways and ending Gullog's tyranny. Beyond the prophecy, elementalists serve as spiritual guides, royal advisors, and guardians of elemental energies. Guided by the teachings of venerable masters and their respected schools and enclaves, elementalists confront Tanares' challenges with the perspective of ancient wisdom.

      <name>History of Elementalism</name>
      <text>Within the time-worn tomes of Tanares, the tale of the elven kin is woven in intricate prose. Once thriving in a realm of unmatched beauty, the elves had their world shattered by the apocalyptic fury of their own goddess, Bás. Spurred by the heinous deeds of the malefic Ungods, her rage laid waste to the once-pristine elven lands. Amidst the frozen ruins, the remnants of the elves sought sanctuary in Tanares, guided by the wisdom of their remaining divine trinity.
	In their newfound haven, the divine triad endowed the elven people with the mystical knowledge of Elementalism, an art that would serve as their salvation and guide their path in the new world. Entwined within this sacred gift, a prophecy unfurled, foretelling the inexorable return of the vengeful Bás and the darkness she would bring upon Tanares.
	As the elves' prowess in Elementalism blossomed, they clung steadfastly to the hallowed teachings, safeguarding the ancestral secrets within their sanctified enclaves and revered schools. Their vigilance endured, ever-alert for the encroaching shadow of Bás's dreaded return.
	As the Evolutionist Church's hold on arcane magic intensified, their ranks infiltrated by Ungod cultists, Elementalism arose as a free and unshackled alternative. The Ungods took little notice of the elementalists, leaving them to hone their craft in peace while manipulating the persecution of wizards and sorcerers. Thus, the elves disseminated their knowledge among diverse species, nurturing a thriving community of elementalists across Tanares.
	Over the ages, water elementalism, once an esteemed elven tradition, dwindled as the winter elves forsook it in pursuit of dark prophecies that transformed them into the kemet people. The remaining elemental arts thrived, providing a substitute for arcane magic. New institutions were founded, as practitioners plumbed the depths of ancient texts, meditated, and performed rites to fortify their bonds with the elements. Their wisdom, echoing the ancient philosophies, became a coveted treasure for rulers, strategists, nobles, and merchants alike. In time, their enclaves, schools, and sects evolved into bastions of enlightenment and erudition.
	During the Kemet Invasion, the Tanares Empire's strength waned considerably. The kemets, under Gullog's command, invaded Tanares to fulfill Golgöggoth's scheme to strip mortals of their emotions, rendering them impervious to Ungod corruption. Though the combined forces of Tanares vanquished Gullog and the kemets, Bás resurfaced, reviving Gullog and forging an alliance with Golgöggoth to transform Tanares into a frozen, undead wasteland akin to the lost elven realm.
	With the ancient prophecy of Bás's return now unfolding, the elementalists must confront the trials posed by Bás and Gullog. The scarcity of water elementalists has led their enclaves to prioritize training new adepts, for it is believed that masters of all four elements are essential in facing Bás.
	As they ready themselves for the impending darkness, the timeless wisdom and deep connections of these exceptional spellweavers will forge the fate of Tanares.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Elementalism and the Ungods</name>
      <text>Elementalists, ever vigilant against the malevolent forces of the Ungods, always aware of the fate of the worlds taken by their corruption, dedicate themselves to thwarting these ancient beings and their wicked schemes. Knowing what happened to the elven world, elementalists recognize the price of failure and commit to safeguarding Tanares from a similar fate.
	Guided by the teachings of venerable masters, elementalists wield the elements to counter the myriad threats posed by the Ungods. They relentlessly confront the hidden servants who sow discord among mortals and battle the penumbral creatures that lurk in the shadows, seeking to breach into the Material Plane. Elementalists tirelessly work to prevent wars and unrest among factions, as they know that such conflicts only serve to empower the Ungods and hasten their nefarious plans.
	Air elementalists, cunning and acrobatic, infiltrate the hidden networks of the Ungods' servants. They disrupt the corrupt machinations from within, shielding the innocent from the clutches of the Cult of Shadow Wing. Earth elementalists, resolute and steadfast, stand guard over sacred places of power, preventing the Ungods from seizing these elemental energy sources. Fire elementalists, with their martial prowess, ignite the hearts of those who would defy the Ungods, inspiring them to resist the encroaching darkness. Water elementalists, rare and sagacious, offer healing and wisdom to those tainted by the Ungods' influence, cleansing them of corruption.
	To strengthen their ranks, elementalists endeavor to educate and inspire others in the ways of elementalism. Through rigorous training and the sharing of wisdom, they prepare new generations to battle the forces of the Ungods and avert the apocalyptic doom that befell their world. They instill a sense of duty, honor, and respect, nurturing lifelong bonds between master and disciple. Thus, the lineage of elemental wisdom endures, perpetually growing stronger.
	Elementalists draw upon the wisdom of their ancestral masters, forging a connection to ancient traditions and spiritual disciplines. Through long seclusions, rigorous study, and intense training, they become dignified forebears, their practices evoking a sense of time-honored tradition and spiritual commitment. They are ever vigilant against the encroachment of the Ungods' influence, striving to preserve the delicate balance of the world.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>The Return of Bás</name>
      <text>The elementalists hold the Cuibhle pantheon in the highest regard, venerating the elven gods as the wisest ancestors and elemental masters. Breith, god of spring and earth; Òigridh, goddess of summer and fire; Aibidh, god of autumn and air; and Bás, once the gentle goddess of winter and death, are believed to spin the wheel of life in an eternal dance.
	Bás, though lost to wrath and vengeance, remains an ancient master of elementalists. Her heart turned cold, and her vision clouded by hatred for the Ungods, so the elementalists do not seek her destruction, but rather her redemption. They liken her to the calm and raging oceans, her actions reflecting the duality of the elemental forces.
	Her alliance with Gullog and Golgöggoth, the Augur, unveiled chilling plans for an icy wasteland free of life, making the world immune to the Ungods' corruption. Bás's goal is a twisted version of her once noble purpose, and the elementalists are integral in halting her descent. Air elementalists disrupt the freezing winds, earth elementalists stand against the encroaching frost, fire elementalists combat the cold with their passion, and water elementalists, critical to restoring balance, strive to heal and rejuvenate the land, countering Bás's icy grasp.
	Rumors suggest that the most ancient elves, direct disciples of the gods themselves, have returned from seclusion following Bás's reemergence. They purportedly carry knowledge of three divine artifacts, imbued with the essence of the gods of Summer, Autumn, and Spring, holding the key to swaying Bás and guiding her back to her pacifist ways. These enigmatic masters are believed to be seeking new apprentices to aid in the journey to stop Bás once and for all.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>The four paths of Elementalism</name>
      <text>Elementalism The sacred art of Elementalism, passed down through generations of masters, manifests in four distinct paths, each reflecting the unique characteristics, tendencies, and worldviews of the elements themselves.
	Air Elementalists, known for their free-spirited and perceptive nature, embody the ephemeral essence of the wind. Their training emphasizes cunning, agility, and the art of deception. Through meditation and practice, these elementalists gain the ability to move with the swiftness of the breeze and even defy gravity. They find solace in tea-making, music, and exploration. When not in their schools, they often join merchant or adventuring groups as wandering masters, preferring to avoid conflict, but navigating challenges with cunning and quick thinking when necessary.
	Earth Elementalists, the bastions of stability and tradition, resonate with the unyielding resilience of stone. Their connection to the earth grants them an unparalleled awareness of its vibrations and mysteries. Often dedicating themselves to matters such as law, architecture, and history, they record the past and present through intricate calligraphy and poetic prose. They may find purpose in bureaucratic positions, state administration, or roles that maintain order, and while they will rarely start conflicts, they are the last to back down.
	Fire Elementalists, fueled by passion and prowess, wield both martial arts and elemental fire in a harmonious dance of destruction and creation. Their training encompasses the mastery of weapons, shields, and close combat. Many who leave their conclaves embark on the path of the soldier, mercenary, or adventurer, seeking wisdom and growth through the heat of battle. They inspire greatness in allies and are the most charismatic of all the elementalists.
	Water Elementalists, rare and nearly lost, have experienced a resurgence as the ancient art of healing and restoration is rediscovered. These wise scholars and empathetic healers possess an unparalleled understanding of life energy, allowing them to mend wounds and protect themselves from harm. They often serve as healers, physicians, counselors, and sages, sharing their wisdom and serenity with those in need. Their patience is formidable, but when pushed to the limit, their wrath is as powerful as a raging ocean.
	Each elementalist path reflects the unique teachings and focus of their respective masters, who guide their apprentices in the ways of their chosen element. Despite their elemental differences, all elementalists share a profound sense of unity and respect for one another. As the world faces the dark threat of Bás and the Forces of Darkall, the elementalists of Tanares stands united.</text>

      <name>Creating an Elementalist</name>
      <text>When creating an elementalist, you must define how do you belong in Elementalism. What is your role? Which element represents you? Do you agree with its precepts? Are you an ally of a group or hermit elementalist? Why are you an adventurer? What do you seek in the world?
	After that, you must also define which characteristics (if any) from your element you carry in your behavior and personality. Are you a passional, fiery person, or are you stubborn like a rock? Or, even if you are connected to a certain element, is your personality more aligned to a different one? These questions define your character's goals, and how it will work to achieve them.</text>

        <text>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player's Handbook, here's what you need to know if you choose elementalist as one of your classes.

Ability Score Minimum:
As a multiclass character, you must have at least the following ability score(s) to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already an elementalist.

	• Wisdom 13

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Multiclass Features</name>
        <text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does).
	Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared:
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.
	Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
	If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots:
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
	If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.
	For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic:
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

        <name>Primordial Element</name>
        <text>Every elementalist has a primary element they are connected to. At 1st level, you must choose your Primordial Element from the following options: Air, Earth, Fire, and Water. Your Primordial Element determines which spells you have access to, your Primary Element, your Secondary Elements, your Opposing Element, and a variety of features at 6th level, 10th level, and 14th level. You have access to spells from your Primary Element, your Secondary Elements, and the fusion of the two, choosing spells from their respective lists, as explained below, but never from your Opposing Element or its fusions. To find out what your Secondary Elements and Opposing Element are, refer to the Primordial Element table.

Primordial Element
Primary Element | Secondary Element | Opposite Element
Air | Fire and Water | Earth
Earth | Fire and Water | Air
Fire | Air and Earth | Water
Water | Air and Earth | Fire

For example: An elementalist who chooses Air can choose their spells from the Air, Fire, and Water spell lists, but can never choose spells from the Earth element, or use any Fusion Spells that include Earth.

      <feature>
        <name>Spellcasting</name>
        <text>Your studies and practices of the elementalism teachings have granted you the ability to cast spells by channeling the power of the elemental planes through the force of will over the elements.

Cantrips. Starting at 1st level, you know 3 cantrips determined by your primary element. You also know the special cantrip elemental surge, which has characteristics determined by your primary element, as well as the essential cantrip of your primary element and one essential cantrip of one of your secondary elements.

Spell slots. The elementalist table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your elemental spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these elemental spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
	For example, if you know the 1st-level elemental spell air beneath your feet and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slots available, you can cast air beneath your feet using either slot.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher. You know two 1st-level spells of your primary element and two 1st-level spells of your secondary elements of your choice from the elemental spell list.
	You learn two spells of your primary element and two of your secondary elements every time you gain access to a new spell level. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn two new spells of 1st or 2nd level. You can never learn to cast spells of your opposite element.
	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the elemental spells you know and replace it with another spell from the elemental spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your elementalist spells, since the power of your magic depends on your willpower over the elements. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an elementalist spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Spellcasting Focus. You can use an elemental focus as a spellcasting focus for your elemental spells.

        <name>Elemental Flux</name>
        <text>Starting at 1st level, when you cast an elemental spell, it generates a magical energy flow that allows you to enhance or modify your elemental surge cantrip. Each spell has in its description how to modify the elemental surge in the Elemental Flux field. This modification only applies to your next elemental surge cast and is lost if you finish a long rest.

        <name>Fusion Spells</name>
        <text>Starting at 1st level, you know all the fusion spells related to your primary and secondary elements, and of the same spell levels your elementalist class level has given you access to (two fusion spells per spell level). However, you can only cast them in a specific way. These fusion spells do not count against the number of your known spells.

Fused Elements | Fusion element
Air and Fire | Lightning
Air and Water | Spirit
Earth and Fire | Lava
Earth and Water | Plant

Casting Fusion Spells:
When you cast an elementalist spell of 1st level or higher, write down the spell's element. If the last two spells you cast have different elements, you can use a spell slot to cast a fusion spell that combines those two elements. When you do this, erase any previous spell notes. If you cast a spell that's not a fusion spell when you already have two spell notes, write down the new spell's element and keep only the last two spell notes, erasing the oldest one. Your spell notes disappear when you finish a short or long rest.
	For example, an elementalist casts accelerate and takes note that he has cast an air spell, then he casts burning eyes and takes note that he has cast a fire spell. When casting his next spell, he may choose to use any of his spell slots to cast a lightning fusion spell of whatever level he has access to, such as energize nerves. If he casts a lightning spell, he must erase all his notes, but if he casts earth armor, an earth elemental spell, he must take note of the earth element and can no longer cast a lightning spell, but now he can cast a lava spell.
