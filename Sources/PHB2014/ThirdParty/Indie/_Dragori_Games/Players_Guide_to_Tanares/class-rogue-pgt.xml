        <name>Roguish Archetype: Ninja (HB)</name>
        <text>Born from the crucible of oppression, Ninjas emerged from the ashes of poverty, bringing their fight against corrupt nobles and officials into the shadows. Trained in the lethal arts of combat, weaponry, and stealth, they wielded their surroundings as a deadly weapon, shrouding their identities in mystery to protect their communities from retaliation. Through relentless training and the refinement of their skills, these rebels transformed into merciless assassins, combat specialists, and the undisputed masters of disguise, all united under the banner of secretive and powerful clans.
	Each Ninja clan is fiercely dedicated to its own unique purpose, guided by the timeless principles of their ancestral leaders. They abide by a strict code of honor, shrouded in mystery, that is as unyielding as their commitment to their cause. While their methods may appear dishonorable to outsiders, the loyalty of each Ninja to their clan is unbreakable, even if it means committing acts that are ethically questionable. This unwavering commitment to the goals set forth by their ancestral leaders forms the very foundation of the Ninja's code of honor.
	In addition to their physical prowess, Ninjas wield a mystical power known as Ki, imbuing their techniques with otherworldly, ethereal effects. While their methods differ from those of monks, the similarities between the two are undeniable and respected by both groups. With their mastery of combat, stealth, and the mystical arts, the Ninjas are a force to be reckoned with, always keeping their true goals hidden from the prying eyes of the outside world.

In Tanares:
	The Kageryoshi, a clan of legendary and respected ninjas in the bustling city of Kagemori, were created by Kagekusari, a powerful Tameranium Dragon and the Fumetsu Tenshikin's son. To counteract the cunning criminal organizations attempting to corrupt Yama from within, led by the formidable Bauronite Avatar Dragon Yokensha, the Kageryoshi were forged to match their wits and strategy.
	The rigorous training of the Kageryoshi begins at a young age, culminating in a final test that involves facing Kagekusari himself in both humanoid and dragon form. Under Kagekusari's guidance, the Kageryoshi mastered their mystical Ki powers, becoming experts in stealth, deception, and manipulation. Their code of honor was unbreakable loyalty to Fumetsu Tenshikin, and they were trained to do whatever was necessary to ensure Yama's success and protect their leader, even if it meant breaking the rules or engaging in unethical acts.
	Fumetsu Tenshikin saw the unmatched skills of the Kageryoshi and appointed them as his elite agents, tasked with the most dangerous and covert missions, especially those in delicate international operations where Yama's other agents could not operate with discretion.
	The Kageryoshi's reputation for ruthlessness is rivaled only by their loyalty to their clan and code of honor. Those who have defected to opposing factions and use their skills for personal gain are seen as traitors and shunned by the Kageryoshi. Kagekusari, as their mentor and guide, embodies their loyalty and power, a testament to the unbreakable bond between the Kageryoshi and Fumetsu Tenshikin.

        <name>Ninja Expertise (Ninja (HB))</name>
        <text>At 3rd level, you can choose one skill from Stealth or Persuasion, and one tool from Disguise kit or Poisoner's kit, to gain proficiency in. If you are already proficient in the chosen skill, you may instead add it to your Expertise list.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Smoke Mastery (Ninja (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, you can use your bonus action to conjure and immediately throw a magical smoke bomb at a point on the ground within 15 feet of you. It creates a dense mystical smoke, heavily obscuring a 15-foot-radius area until the start of your next turn. You can see through the smoke normally and have advantage on attacks against creatures inside the smoke that cannot see you.
	While you are inside the smoke, your opportunity attacks deal an extra 1d4 damage to creatures that are also inside the smoke. You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 plus your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses after a short or long rest.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Ninjutsu (Ninja (HB))</name>
        <text>At 3rd level, your training in ninja martial arts grants you mastery of ninja fighting styles involving unarmed and armed strikes. You gain the following benefits while you are not wearing medium or heavy armor or wielding a shield:

	• You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes, and you can deliver Sneak Attacks with them as though they were finesse weapons.

	• You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage for your unarmed strikes or melee and thrown weapons. Starting at 6th level, your attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical damage. The damage die for these attacks changes to a d6 at 6th level, a d8 at 11th level, and a d10 at 16th level.

Note: If you are using a magic weapon, you may choose to use this feature's damage die while retaining the weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls and its other properties.

        <name>Kawarime (Ninja (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 9th level, when you use the class feature Uncanny Dodge, if there is a location within 20 feet of you that you can see and where a creature of your size could hide, you can teleport to that location, leaving behind a wooden decoy created instantly through your power. This decoy disappears at the start of your next turn.
	You still take half damage from the triggering attack, but you can take a Hide action immediately after teleporting.
	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), regaining all expended uses after a short or long rest.

        <name>Ninja Steps (Ninja (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 13th level, you develop the legendary ninja step. When you take the Dash action as an action or bonus action, you gain the following benefits:

	• You ignore difficult terrain and can move as though you have a climbing speed. Additionally, you can traverse extremely fragile surfaces, such as water or thin tree branches, as if they were solid ground, without regard for your weight or the weight of your equipment. However, you cannot support yourself in midair.

	• While traveling, you don't suffer penalties to Wisdom (Perception) checks due to moving quickly, and you can't be tracked, even by magical means.

        <text>At 17th level, your Sneak Attack becomes even deadlier due to your ninjutsu training. If you are hidden from a creature and make an attack that triggers your Sneak Attack damage against it, the damage dice for your Sneak Attack become d8s instead of d6s.
