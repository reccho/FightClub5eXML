        <text>The bards of the College of Life stand out as masters of life magic and music, wielding their art to tap into the life force that permeates the world. With their songs, they create a powerful connection to the essence of life, inspiring hope and healing even the most dire wounds.
	These bards are renowned for their mastery of the life force and their ability to communicate with animals and other woodland creatures. They can often be found in serene groves, surrounded by nature, where they commune with the creatures and bring peace to the land with their music. But they are also powerful in battle, radiating the vital energy of life to heal and protect their allies, using their melodies to infuse their surroundings with the power of life.
	One of the greatest legends in Tanares is the elusive Eighth Note, a musical technique said to hold the power to connect the lives of many creatures, healing physical and mental ailments, injuries, and curses. Some even believe that those connected through the Eighth Note are blessed with eternal youth and immortality.
	Despite its enigmatic nature, the College of Life remains dedicated to unlocking the power of the Eighth Note, bringing its benefits to the world of Tanares. Many bards have devoted their lives to uncovering the secrets of this legendary technique, with some even speculating that the renowned bard, Jade, holds the key to unlocking its power. Despite her silence on the matter, the College of Life continues its quest for the harmonious power of the Eighth Note, determined to bring its life-giving magic to all who seek it.

Any excess hit points become temporary hit points that last until the ally finishes a short or long rest.
