        <name>Divine Domain: Chaos Domain (HB)</name>
        <text>Clerics of chaos, primarily linked with the Windspeaker and Ba-Ka faiths, embrace spontaneity, freedom, and perpetual change. Their decision-making reflects this spirit, using luck and randomness to determine the optimal course of action in uncertain situations. It's not unusual for a cleric of chaos to cast lots when concrete evidence is lacking, acknowledging the futility of controlling chance and fully accepting it.
	These clerics maintain that unpredictability is the only constant and that excessive reliance on laws and order stifles progress. They consider hierarchy limiting, as it constrains individuals and favors those in power. They believe natural chaos enables creatures to unveil their true selves and achieve their potential through self-responsibility.
	Windspeaker clerics of chaos honor Tamera and Bauron, the dual deities, by accepting the unpredictable and leaving matters to chance. They assert the world was born from the fusion of these conflicting natures, creating chaos. Conversely, clerics of chaos devoted to Ba-Ka, the Spirit God of Magic, laud the deity's endorsement of magic in all its forms. They value that Chaos domain clerics can use magic from other domains, crediting this to Ba-Ka's influence. These clerics see the extensive and intricate power of magic as irrefutable evidence of chaos's potency, as magic transforms the world's structure and rules.
	The Evolutionist Church previously harbored clerics of chaos who considered Bauron a God of Chaos. However, recent revelations from angels exposed the Ungods' manipulation of sacred scriptures. Now recognizing Bauron as a law-abiding god of punishment, these clerics have either amended their views or left the church to pursue new life paths.

In Other Settings:
Clerics in this domain associate with chaos gods like Loki and Seth. They usually seek to subvert the status quo of the world, bringing chaos and disorder and destabilizing society and the prevailing authorities. Some may seek good and innovation, while others may dedicate themselves to destruction.

At each indicated cleric level, add the listed spells to your spells prepared. They do not count towards your limit.

        <name>Preparing Spells (Chaos Domain (HB))</name>
        <text>When you're preparing your spells, immediately after finishing a long rest, you may choose to prepare your spells using the cleric spell list, or roll 1d6 and compare the result to the Determining the List of Spells for Clerics of Chaos table to randomly determine which spell list you will use to prepare them.

Determining the List of Spells for Clerics of Chaos:
d6 | Spell List
1 | Bard
2 | Cleric
3 | Druid
4 | Sorcerer
5 | Warlock
6 | Wizard

When you prepare spells from spell lists other than the cleric spell list, they become considered cleric spells for you. You retain access to all spells from your domain, but not other cleric spells. All other cleric spellcasting rules apply normally. Even if you acquire a spell list whose normal casters do not know all spells on the list to prepare them, you will still use the cleric rules, able to prepare any spell on the list as if it were a known spell for you.
	As a cleric of chaos, it's important to prepare a spell list for each possible option above in advance. This will ensure that you're ready to play and can easily switch your spell list as needed, without making other players wait. Remember to be courteous and considerate to your fellow players, even as you embody the chaos of your deity.

Roll 1d10 and refer to the Infuse Chaos table to determine the new damage type. If the spell originally inflicts the same damage, the chaos-infused spell gains additional power, granting an extra 1d10 bonus damage of that same type. This bonus increases to 2d10 at 12th level.

        <text>At 2nd level, you can harness your Channel Divinity to emit an aura of pure chaos, confusing hostile creatures and inciting them to strike their allies. As an action, you raise your holy symbol, forcing all enemies within 30 feet of you who can see you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, they are compelled to move up to 10 feet towards another creature of your choosing and make a melee attack if possible. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks, and it occurs according to the initiative order.

        <text>At 1st level, you have a number of Courage Points equal to your Wisdom modifier. You recover all your Courage Points after a short rest. 
	The Courage Points can initially be used in three ways:

	â€¢ When a creature within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw, you can spend a Courage Point as a reaction to instill in it the will to fight on. The creature can make a new saving throw and must use the second result.

	â€¢ As a bonus action, you can spend a Courage Point to summon your inner strength and smite your foes. Until the start of your next turn, your first successful melee attack deals +1d10 damage of the same type as your weapon. This damage increases to +2d10 at 6th level, +3d10 at 12th level, and +4d10 at 18th level.

	â€¢ As an action, you can spend a Courage Point to shout a powerful war cry that strengthens your party's resolve. You and all allies within 30 feet of you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + your cleric level for 1 minute, and can roll a saving throw to remove any effect causing the frightened condition. While the temporary hit points last, they also give advantage on all other saving throws made against effects that cause the frightened condition.
