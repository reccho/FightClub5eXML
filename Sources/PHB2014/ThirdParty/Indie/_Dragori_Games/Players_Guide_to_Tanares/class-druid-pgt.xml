        <name>Druid Circle: Circle of the Bloom (Tanares HB)</name>
        <text>Druids of the Circle of the Bloom hold a special reverence for the power and importance of plant life in the natural world. They form deep, personal connections with the plants they care for, viewing them as beloved friends and family, and often giving them individual names. These druids are known to talk to their plants, nurturing their growth and helping them to flourish.
	Their deep connection with the natural world is so strong that it calls forth a guardian spirit from the forest to accompany them on their journey. This spirit takes the form of a physical plant, and is a tireless protector, ready to defend the druid from any danger. As the druid grows in power and knowledge, so too does their spirit, evolving into a more formidable form, yet never losing its bond with its chosen druid.
	The Circle of the Bloom is dedicated to preserving and restoring the natural balance of forests and other vegetation, recognizing that all creatures can benefit from the abundance and vitality of plants. From their bountiful fruits and herbs, to their life-giving essence and ability to heal, plants are a vital source of sustenance and growth. The most passionate members of the circle will even venture into the dangerous and mysterious Penumbral Plane to protect the plants that grow there, and to restore balance to the forces of nature.

Circle Spells:
Your mystical connection to the natural flora imbues you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level, you gain access to the spells listed on the Circle of the Bloom Spells table below. Once you have access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it does not count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you have access to a spell that does not appear on the druid spell list, the spell is considered a druid spell for you, nonetheless.


Circle of the Bloom Spells:
Druid Level | Circle Spells
3rd | spike growth, spore blow*
5th | speak with plants, wildpath*
7th | conjure woodland beings, tranquil grove*
9th | awaken, tree stride

Additionally, add poison spray to your list of known cantrips.

        <name>Plant Empathy (Circle of the Bloom (Tanares HB))</name>
        <text>Starting the 2nd level, you obtain the capability to comprehend and communicate telepathically with plants within 30 feet of you. For this communication, all non-intelligent plants are treated as creatures with basic Intelligence (i.e., Int 3). Their knowledge and cognizance are restrained by their intelligence, yet they can provide you with information regarding nearby places and creatures, including everything they have observed within the past day. However, keep in mind that gaining knowledge from plants might require persuading them or doing simple tasks (such as watering, pruning, or removing a troublesome rodent family) at the GM's discretion.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Plant Guardian (Circle of the Bloom (Tanares HB))</name>
        <text>At 2nd level, you learn a ritual that calls forth a spirit taking the shape of a plant-type creature known as a Plant Guardian. This ritual, involving roughly four hours of meditation, can be completed during a long rest. After the ritual, the Plant Guardian appears and stays with you until it drops to 0 hit points, or it's dismissed as a bonus action. In case of its death or dismissal, you can resurrect it by conducting the same ritual.
	The Plant Guardian follows the stat blocks listed on the Plant Guardian table and can take the form of a plant of your choice, determined at the time of the ritual and respecting the size of the creature.
	The Plant Guardian obeys your orders to the best of its abilities and is always friendly towards you. It has its own initiative and acts independently on its turn, but its actions are limited to Dodge unless you command it otherwise on your turn as a bonus action. In that case, the Plant Guardian can execute any action of your choosing that it is capable of on its next turn.
	When the Plant Guardian is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies, leaving behind only the wilted remnants of its form, which subsequently lose any attributes the original plant may have possessed.

Plant Guardian Table:
Required Druid Level | Plant Guardian Stat Block
2nd | Guardian Sprout
6th | Guardian Bush
10th | Guardian Shrub
14th | Guardian Tree
18th | Ancient Guardian

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Plant Wild Shape (Circle of the Bloom (Tanares HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 6th level, your Wild Shape ability allows you to transform into plant-type creatures. Additionally, you can choose to transform into a plant-type variant of a creature that you're already capable of transforming into. The creature has a wooden, branch and leaf appearance and is considered a plant-type creature in addition to its other types. Use the stat block of the same creature, but you have resistance to piercing or bludgeoning damage, and vulnerability to fire damage. All other rules for Wild Shape still apply as usual, including the max. CR.
	When in a plant-type form, you gain an additional ability: Branch Snare.

Branch Snare. Every time you hit a creature with a melee attack during your turn, you have the option to ensnare that creature if it is no more than one size category larger than you. The creature becomes grappled by you (escape DC 13, plus your proficiency bonus). As long as this grapple persists, your melee attacks are restricted to the ensnared creature only

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Bloom (Circle of the Bloom (Tanares HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at the 10th level, you can synchronize with your Plant Guardian, triggering it to bloom and bear fruit. This tuning process takes 10 minutes and results in your Plant Guardian producing a number of fruits equivalent to your proficiency bonus, which last for 24 hours.
	Your Plant Guardian must have received sunlight for at least one hour in the last 24 hours to produce these fruits. Consuming one of these fruits as an action confers several benefits:

	• For the rest of the day, the creature no longer needs to drink or eat;
	• The creature regains 1d12 hit points; and
	• The creature is cured of any diseases afflicting it, and the conditions blinded, deafened, and poisoned are removed.

You can only tune in again with your Plant Guardian after completing a long rest.

Additionally, you gain the innate ability to cast the speak with plants spell at will, without spending a spell slot.
