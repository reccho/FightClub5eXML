        <name>Primal Path: Path of the Brutal Hunter (HB)</name>
        <text>The Path of the Brutal Hunter is a barbaric tradition that holds to the notion that in the grand scheme of things, all beings are either hunters or prey. Those who embrace this path aim to become the ultimate predator, stalking and taking down the most formidable quarry they can find. The rite of passage for these barbarians involves solo hunting expeditions, where they must bring down the most powerful creature they can find. This rite is highly regarded within their tribes and serves as a way to prove one's worth, attain prestige, or face shame.
	Fueled by a burning desire to demonstrate their strength to themselves, their tribe, or their enemies, the Brutal Hunters relentlessly pursue their targets with unyielding fervor. They may hunt for revenge against those who have wronged them, eliminate enemies, or prove their dominance over powerful creatures, making them trophies to add to their collection.
	Brutal Hunters take immense pride in their hunting trophies, viewing them as a symbol of their strength and prowess. Their collection of teeth from their fallen prey is a source of great respect among their peers and serves as a testament to their power. They are never content to rest on their laurels and are always seeking out greater challenges and more powerful prey, driven by a thirst to prove themselves and secure their place at the top of the food chain.

        <name>Prey Mark (Path of the Brutal Hunter (HB))</name>
        <text>Upon selecting this path at the 3rd level, you can use a bonus action to designate a creature within your sight as your prey. This selection grants you the following benefits against your chosen quarry:

	• You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to perceive your prey, as well as on Wisdom (Survival) checks made to track it. 

	• Your prey have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) rolls made against you. 

	• Once you enter your rage, your attacks against your prey deal an extra 1d4 damage of the same type caused by the attack. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 1d6 at 9th level and 1d8 at 15th level.

You can have only one active prey at a time, and you can't switch targets unless the current target is defeated or until you finish a short or long rest. At the end of each rest, you must decide whether to retain or dismiss your current prey, provided you have one.

        <name>Primal Path: Path of the Penumbra (HB)</name>
        <text>Tanares is a world with many dangers and few places are as treacherous as the Penumbral Plane. It takes a truly exceptional individual to survive in this realm of darkness, and the penumbral barbarians are such a breed. These barbarians have honed their skills through constant conflict and challenges and are composed of the strongest, the bravest, and sometimes even the most reckless outcasts.
	The trials of life in the Penumbral Plane have given rise to a new path, one of unparalleled combative prowess. These barbarians undergo grueling physical and mental training to become masters of survival and combat, and many of the gloomfolks tribesmen aspire to join this path. By continuously hunting and feeding on the power of the fearsome penumbral creatures they become resistant to the Penumbral Plane's dangerous effects. These warriors wield weapons imbued with nightmarish power, striking fear into the hearts of their enemies.
	In addition to their combat prowess, penumbral barbarians are highly skilled navigators of the treacherous terrain of the Penumbral Plane. They possess great knowledge about the flora and fauna of the penumbra, as well as its many complex layers, using this expertise to gain an advantage in both survival and battle.
	The penumbral barbarians are a proud people, often sharing their incredible stories of survival and bravery with those who dare to enter their domain. These tales, recounted with conviction, combined with the warriors' fearsome reputation, leave a lasting impression on all who encounter them. The authenticity of these stories may be called into question, but the penumbral barbarians' unwavering spirit and bravery is undeniable.

In Other Settings:
Even if you are not playing in Tanares, the use of this sub class is not only possible but also straightforward. Simply adapt any mention of the Penumbral Plane to any similar dark or astral environments that you can treat as shadow, a good example being the Shadowfell.
