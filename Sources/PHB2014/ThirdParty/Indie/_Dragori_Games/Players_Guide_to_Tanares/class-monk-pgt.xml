        <name>Monastic Tradition: Way of the Animals (HB)</name>
        <text>Monks of the Way of the Animals embody the pinnacle of martial arts and wisdom, seeking to perfect their combat skills through a deep understanding of nature and the movements of different creatures. By blending and alternating between various animal stances, these monks have achieved a fluidity of body and spirit that is unmatched, expanding their Ki and granting them a broad and insightful perspective into the world.
	Not only are these monks masters of combat, but they also possess a unique worldview that is shaped by their connection to the animals they emulate. They see the world and those around them through the lens of different creatures, each with its own distinctive characteristics and traits. They might describe someone as cunning as a snake, determined like a tiger, precise like a praying mantis, cunning like a monkey, or unshakable like a dragon. This unique perspective has made the masters of the Way of the Animals be seen as wise sages, sought after by many who seek enlightenment and a deeper understanding of the world.

        <name>Animal Stance (Way of the Animals (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, you choose two of the six available animal stances. Each of these stances was created based on the observation of the fighting style of the creatures that named them: Crane, Monkey, Praying Mantis, Tiger, Snake, and Dragon. At 9th level, you learn another animal stance and another at 15th level.

Switching Stances:
During the initiative roll, you must declare which animal stance you will be in at the start of combat. However, you can switch animal stance throughout battle in three ways:

Spending a Ki Point: During your turn, you may spend 1 Ki Point to switch your animal stance. It does not consume any action and can only be performed once per turn.

Using the Switch Trigger of the Stance you are: If the Switch Trigger occurs, you may perform the Special Reaction described on your current Animal Stance to change to any other animal stance you know. You cannot use the Special Reaction and remain in the same Stance.

Using the Switch Trigger of another stance: If the Switch Trigger of another animal stance you know happens, you may perform the Special Reaction described on that Animal Stace to change your Stance to that same animal.

In summary, you can change your stance either by using Ki points, or:

	1. When the Switch Trigger of the Stance you are in happens, you may change to another Stance of your choice.
	For example: If you are in the Praying Mantis Stance and a creature within your reach declares a melee attack against you, you may perform an unarmed or monk weapon melee attack against the creature that declared the attack, due to the Praying Mantis Special Reaction. Then you must switch to another Stance you know.

	2. When the Switch Trigger of a Stance you have but you are not currently in happens, you may change to that stance.
	For example: If you are in the Tiger Stance and a creature within your reach declares an attack against you, you can switch to the Praying Mantis Stance and then perform an unarmed or monk weapon melee attack against the creature that declared the attack, due to the Praying Mantis Special Reaction. Then you must switch to the Praying Mantis Stance.
