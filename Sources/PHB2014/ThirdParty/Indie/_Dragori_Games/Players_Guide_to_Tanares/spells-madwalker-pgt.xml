    <text>As a bonus action, you can generate a glowing, bioluminescent substance. This secretion illuminates an area within 5 feet with dim light and leaves a luminous trail wherever you move. After 8 hours, the mutation ends, and the emission fades entirely.
	You can prematurely end this mutation to discharge a larger, slick amount of secretion over a 15-foot cone on the ground, rendering it as difficult terrain. All creatures within this area must pass a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that either enters or ends its turn in this area must also make the Dexterity saving throw. The area stays illuminated and slippery for 8 hours.
	You can augment the size of the cone, up to a maximum of +25 feet, gaining 1 extra Insanity Point for every additional 5 feet. Your total Insanity Points cannot exceed the limit when enlarging the area. Also, you cannot use this power if you are at your Insanity Point maximum.

    <components>(1 Insanity Point, +1 per extra point of damage (see below))</components>
    <classes>Madwalker (Aberrant Mutations)</classes>
    <text>Before rolling for an attack, you can, as a free action, infuse your weapons with dark energy. Until the start of your next turn, your next successful attack deals an additional 1d6 necrotic damage. Before the attack roll, you can choose to gain extra Insanity Points to bolster this damage, as long as the total points gained per use of this mutation do not exceed your madwalker level. For each extra Insanity Point you gain, add 1 to the necrotic damage roll. The total Insanity Points gained cannot exceed your current Insanity Point limit, except when using this mutation without gaining extra points.
	For instance, a 3rd-level madwalker using this power can gain 1 Insanity Point to deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage, 2 points to deal 1d6+1, or 3 points to deal 1d6+2. However, she couldn't gain 4 points, as it would exceed her level. If the current Insanity Point total is 10 and the limit is 12, she can only gain 1 or 2 points on this power. Once she reaches 12 points, she can still use this power (+1d6) but can no longer increase its damage.

Note: This ability enables a madwalker to rapidly elevate her insanity level if she wishes to reach the Penumbral Shape sooner.

	• As an action, you can pull, drag, or lift an object or willing creature, or cling onto something. When performing these actions, you can carry twice the weight your Strength normally allows.

	• As a bonus action, the tentacle can interact with objects. For instance, it can open or shut containers and doors, utilize keys, activate levers, push buttons, grasp small objects, and other similar tasks, subject to the GM's discretion.

	• The tentacle can function as an auxiliary limb, granting you advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) checks.

	• The tentacle can be used as a melee weapon endowed with light and finesse properties. It has a reach of 10 feet and deals 1d10 bludgeoning damage. If you're wielding a weapon in one hand, the tentacle can serve as a second light weapon for two-weapon combat.

	• The tentacle cannot wield a shield.

A creature hearing the sound can attempt a DC 18 Wisdom (Insight) check to identify it as an imitation. With an action, you can end this mutation and release a frightful roar that resonates across a 10-foot radius. Each creature within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or suffer 2d4 thunder damage and be frightened for 1 minute. An affected creature must attempt a new Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. Upon success, the effect ceases and the creature becomes immune to it for the next 24 hours.

	• You can launch a web at an object and pull it towards you. If it is heavier than 10 pounds, you must pull it using your own Strength.

	• You can affix the web to objects or solid surfaces, granting advantage on Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks when climbing.

	• You can use the web to obstruct an area up to 20 feet in diameter between two solid objects; a creature entering the blocked area must succeed on a Strength ability check or become restrained until the end of its next turn.

	• You can aim a web at a creature within range. If the creature fails a Dexterity saving throw, it is restrained for the duration of the effect. It can attempt a Strength saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the condition.

Furthermore, for the duration of the link, both can use the Help action on Intelligence ability checks made even at a distance.
	Alternatively, this mutation can be used against a hostile creature to access its surface thoughts. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw; otherwise, you discern its emotional state, and it has disadvantage on all attacks against you until your the start of next turn.

They occupy the same space as you and move with you for 1 minute, mirroring your every action and randomly shifting positions around your body, making them indistinguishable from you. For the duration of this mutation, each time a creature targets you with an attack, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your clones. With two clones, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one clone, you must roll an 11 or higher.
	A clone's AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a clone, it is destroyed.
	If a creature adjacent to you is attacked, you can take a reaction to confuse the attacker with one of your clones and impose disadvantage on the attack roll, destroying the clone.
	These are the only ways to destroy a clone, as it ignores all damage and effects.
	Creatures that don't rely on sight or can see through illusions (such as truesight) are unaffected by this mutation.

    <text>As an action, you can take on the qualities of a penumbral bat, gaining a set of distortive wings that provide a flying speed of 30 feet, blindsight within a 60-foot radius, and clawed feet capable of grabbing objects and creatures up to one size larger than yours.
	While flying, you can use your bonus action to make a proficient melee weapon attack to grab a target on a hit, enabling you to carry items or creatures weighing up to 45 times your Strength score without penalties to your speed, or weighing above that to a maximum of 90 times your Strength score, but your speed is halved.
	This transformation lasts 10 minutes, and you can opt to extend its duration for an additional 10 minutes by gaining 3 more Insanity Points. If you're in the air when the effect ends and you don't extend it, you fall immediately.

An eruption of penumbral energy streaks between these portals, forcing any creature within a 10-foot wide line extending the distance between the portals to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they suffer 4d8 necrotic damage and 4d8 force damage, taking half as much damage on a successful save. The portals vanish at the end of the turn.

As an action, you alter your glands to produce potent pheromones that radiate up to 60 feet around you for the next hour. Any humanoid creature that enters or starts its turn in this area must make a Constitution saving throw. Creatures engaged in combat with you have advantage on this saving throw.
	Those who fail are charmed by you, viewing you as a friendly acquaintance, while those who succeed are unaffected. Creatures immune to poison or those that don't need to breathe automatically succeed. Winds of moderate or greater speed disperse your pheromones, negating this effect.

As a bonus action, you can manipulate objects up to 30 feet away from you, provided their total weight doesn't exceed 30 times your Wisdom score. If an object isn't worn or carried, you can move it up to 30 feet in any direction. Worn or carried items require the owner to fail a Strength saving throw for you to move them. Your telekinetic control also allows you to handle small objects delicately, open containers, retrieve or store items, or pour out the contents of a vial. This control lasts up to 10 minutes.
	Alternatively, as an action, you can use your telekinesis to hurl a creature up to one size larger than you up to 30 feet away in any direction of your choosing. If this creature collides with a solid structure or another creature, it suffers 6d10 bludgeoning damage and falls prone. The creature it collides with can make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage and to avoid falling prone.

You can use your action to attack with them, making four attacks, one with each tentacle. They have a 10-foot reach, use either your Strength or Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls, and deal 3d4 bludgeoning damage per hit.
	When a creature enters a space within reach of a tentacle, you can lash out with an immediate attack (as a free action) up to four times until the start of your next turn. Successful hits can be used to grapple the target, automatically dealing damage at the start of each of its turns. As an action, a grappled creature can attempt to escape with a successful Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against a DC 20. A grappling tentacle cannot attack.

Upon invoking this mutation, make a proficient melee weapon attack against a creature. On a hit, you bite the creature, dealing 7d8 slashing damage and 7d8 necrotic damage, and causing a bleeding effect.
	The bleeding creature takes 1d10 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns and can attempt a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns to staunch the bleeding. If your bite damage reduces a Medium or smaller creature to 0 hit points, you can consume it with a bonus action, earning temporary hit points equal to half the bite damage. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour.

Each targeted creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or suffer 6d8 psychic damage and perceive you and your allies as incarnations of their deepest fears due to memories you implant. They remain frightened of you and your allies for the duration.
	Alternatively, you can forgo the damage to implant different types of memories in those who fail their saving throw. Consult with your GM for potential uses. Affected creatures can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success.

The afflicted creature suffers 10d10 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns, and you recover hit points equal to half the inflicted damage. The target's speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it can use an action to try to pry you off, making a Strength saving throw. On a success, you are dislodged and fall prone in an adjacent space. While leeching, you are unable to take actions, bonus actions, or reactions, and you are immobile, sticking to your host. Should the creature's hit points reach zero, your parasitic grip ceases, and you appear in an unoccupied adjacent space. At the start of your turn, while leeching, you can gain an extra Insanity Point to voluntarily detach and stand in a nearby unoccupied space.
