      <name>Redeemer</name>
      <text>Amidst the bustling city, a tiefling preacher stands on a crate, captivating the faithful with honeyed words that evoke adulation. The crowd showers him with trinkets and coins, and he catches them with a sly smile, claiming the treasures in the name of the gods. But the faithful can't help but wonder if his motives are pure, and if their requests will come true.
	As the sun sets, a cirrus enters the home of an ailing child, unnoticed by all. The parents offer everything they have, believing in the wanderer's saintly aura. With a gentle touch, the cirrus fills the room with hope, and the child is miraculously cured. The guardian angel fades into the night, never seeking payment or recognition. A silent and selfless savior.
	In a murky alleyway, an elf waits for bandits and their stolen gold. When they appear, he unleashes an inky burst of energy, sending one of the thieves flying. The others falter, and the elf claims the coins as a reward for justice. Many question his methods, and if his desire for retribution goes too far. The elf justifies his actions as the means to a righteous end.
	Redeemers are divine spellcasters chosen by the gods, using energy rays to heal or harm. Guided by prophetic dreams, they possess unique charisma and influence to inspire others. They purify negative emotions, bestow blessings and are embodiments of Tamera and Bauron's duality.
	Across the vast eons of Tanares, redeemers have served as divine emissaries of the celestial deities Tamera and Bauron, bestowed with divine magic and exceptional charisma. Endowed with a natural ability to move mortal hearts, they develop a plethora of skills, individually guided by their prophetic dreams and visions of destiny. Bound by their divine calling, redeemers tread a unique path, interpreting and sharing their revelations of the gods' will, which grants them profound insights into the world.
	Amidst the spreading darkness of the Ungods' corruption, redeemers emerge as spiritual beacons, wielding their divine gifts to cleanse objects tainted by mortal sins and malevolent desires. In doing so, they turn these once-corrupted items into wellsprings of sacred power, banishing the influence of the Ungods and gaining power to give their blessings upon those in need.
	As visionaries of unrivaled allure, redeemers shepherd their followers, inspiring unwavering faith in their divine guidance. Skilled in the arts of negotiation, trade, and leadership, they serve as revered advisors and orators, their celestial blessings from both Tamera and Baron granting them a harmonious perspective on the world and the wisdom to find balance between extremes.
	Though their convictions may diverge from established doctrines and from each other, most redeemers remain united by their divine purpose. Their liberty of belief extends even to those who renounce the gods, embracing twisted philosophies to justify their actions. Yet, their divine powers remain undiminished, stirring fervent discourse within the halls of the Celestianist Church regarding their sacred nature.
	As prophets and visionaries, redeemers effortlessly draw adherents to their cause, forming tight-knit circles of devout believers. With their vast array of divine spells and their innate ability to perceive the emotions of others, they become sought after by those yearning for spiritual guidance and divine intervention.

      <name>Redeemer History</name>
      <text>In the nascent days of Tanares, when the divine permeated the land, an extraordinary caste of individuals arose. Consecrated by the deities Tamera and Bauron, they came to be known as the redeemers. At first, these divine envoys were scarce and enigmatic, yet their influence would reverberate across the ages, shaping the world in ways both profound and nuanced.
	Among these celestial emissaries were the cirrus Windspeakers, who partook of the gods' words through the angels that forged them. They were but the vanguard of the redeemers who would traverse Tanares' realms, guided by prophetic dreams and visions heralding the world's pivotal moments.
	Throughout the epochs, redeemers have stirred cult followings with their singular interpretations of divine will. Yet their distinctive wisdom and divine endowments have incurred the wrath of the Evolutionist Church, which sought to suppress them in its quest for spiritual hegemony.
	As the Evolutionist Church ascended to prominence, wielding unparalleled might and sway, it came to regard redeemers and the cirrus people with contempt. The redeemers' distinctive interpretations of sacred texts and their god-given powers were perceived as a threat to the Church's dominion. This tension ultimately culminated in a campaign of persecution, with the Church hunting redeemers and driving the cirrus species to the brink of extinction.
	In contemporary times, the Evolutionist Church has undergone a metamorphosis. With the return of a few angels to the mortal plane, the Church has been compelled to confront the corruption within its echelons and the manipulation of its sacred texts by the insidious Ungods' agents entrenched in the Church's ecclesiastical hierarchy. In response, the Church has rebranded itself as the Celestianist Church, embarking on sweeping reforms to expunge the Cult of Shadow Wing from its midst.
	In this era, redeemers took even greater prevalence. Their divine gifts and prophetic insights, once spurned by the Evolutionist Church, are now embraced by many within the reformed Celestianist Church. Nevertheless, some redeemers harbor mistrust towards the Church's past transgressions and choose to maintain their autonomy, cultivating their own followings and interpreting the gods' will as they deem appropriate.
	The redeemers' tenacity and adaptability have enabled them to endure millennia of persecution and transformation. Today, their divine powers and unyielding convictions remain as potent as ever. As charismatic leaders, spiritual guides, great prophets, and potent spellcasters, the redeemers stand as pivotal figures in the politics and power struggles among the diverse factions and kingdoms seeking to sway the common people to advance their agendas.</text>

      <name>Purging the Corruption</name>
      <text>Unfettered by dogma or doctrine, most of these consecrated beings follow their personal convictions, channeling their divine-bestowed powers to purify Tanares and battle the sinister Ungods.
	Gifted with an unparalleled aptitude for discerning and extracting malevolent energies from precious objects, redeemers transmute these dark forces into sanctified blessings. They personify the restorative radiance of Tamera and the annihilating fury of Bauron, embodying a duality that empowers them to expunge Tanares of the corruption spawned by the nefarious Ungods.
	In their call against the forces of darkness, redeemers are guided by cryptic dreams and prophetic visions bestowed by Tamera and Bauron. This divine foresight enables them to undermine their adversaries and tilt the balance in the protracted, ages-old struggle that has determined the destiny of Tanares.
	All too aware of the redeemers' formidable abilities, the Ungods contrive insidious stratagems to thwart their celestial foes. They desecrate temples, infiltrate religious institutions, manipulate governing bodies against rising redeemers, and foment dissension among believers in a bid to sabotage the redeemers' influence and obstruct their divine mission.
	Yet, redeemers possess a steadfast conviction that remains unshaken, employing their versatile talents to surmount the challenges of their sacred vocation. Through their divine revelations, redeemers frequently find themselves in the path of the Ungods' schemes, either consciously or inadvertently wielding their extraordinary powers to shield Tanares from the darkness that seeks to engulf it.
	In a realm plagued by corruption, redeemers stand as instruments of the gods, their divine endowments a testament to the might of Tamera and Bauron, and their conferred gifts a beacon of hope in the battle to purify Tanares from the malevolence that imperils it.</text>

      <name>Religious Conflicts in Tanares</name>
      <text>Tanares, a land steeped in diverse and tumultuous religious traditions, has long been a crucible for conflicting ideologies. Redeemers have historically stood amidst this strife, their unique insights into the divine will often clashing with prevailing dogmas of established institutions. Despite these variations, redeemers have consistently demonstrated an ability to wield divine powers, often leading to the formation of devoted followings. This only served to fuel further conflict, providing ample opportunities for the sinister Ungods and their minions to sow discord and manipulate opposing factions, ultimately corrupting the souls of the fallen.
	The Celestianist Church, formerly known as the Evolutionist Church, venerates the celestial deities Tamera and Bauron and remains the dominant religious institution in Tanares. Despite recent major reforms, spurred by angelic revelations regarding the true nature of the gods and the corruption of sacred scriptures by the Cult of Shadow Wing, the Church maintains its power and structure in the land.
	Ranged against the Celestianists are various factions, including the insidious Cult of Shadow Wing, which favors the four Ungods seeking to engulf Tanares in corruption. The fallen elven goddess Bás, while also opposed to the Ungods, is an enemy of the Church too, due to her apocalyptic solution that defends a world of ice and the undead.
	While the Ba-Ka faith, worshiping the Spirit God of Magic, had historically clashed with the Evolutionist Church due to the Evolutionists aversion to arcane magic, the Celestianist reform has eased tensions between them, albeit with lingering distrust. The Cuibhle Pantheon, an elven religion venerating elemental deities, has forged an alliance with the Celestianist Church against Bás and the Cult of Shadow Wing.
	Other faiths, such as Luminism, Fumetsu Eido, Fruitlism, and Dorsianism, occupy unique positions in Tanares. Lumina, the Goddess of Wisdom, has formed a new alliance with the Celestianist Church, while Fumetsu Tenshikin, a dragon claiming godhood through angelic artifacts, has transitioned from a tolerated enemy to an uneasy ally. Fruitful, a halfling deity, and Dorsi, the Guardian God of dwarves, both enjoy strong relationships with the reformed Church.
	However, it is the Windspeaker religion of the cirrus people that best exemplifies the religious turmoil that has historically plagued Tanares. The cirrus, once a thriving civilization, were nearly eradicated by the Evolutionist Church's inquisition, which condemned the Windspeaker faith as heresy due to its divergent interpretations of sacred scriptures. The reformed Celestianists, despite theological differences, now seek to mend relations with the surviving cirrus and Windspeakers.
These religious divisions and alliances, complex in nature, share a common theme: the interplay of divine power and mortal interpretation. Redeemers, with their unique divinely inspired dreams, have only further fueled these conflicts, as their singular visions rarely align with the religious interpretations of others.
	With recent revelations concerning the gods' true nature and the corrupted sacred scriptures, the religious landscape in Tanares teeters on the precipice of a new era. While some redeemers have joined the reformed Celestianist Church to help cleanse it of corruption, others remain cautious of the institution's past and continue to pursue their divine callings independently.
	The religious strife in Tanares, shaped by the interplay of divine gifts and mortal interpretation, continues to mold the destiny of this multifaceted realm. As new alliances form and old adversaries reemerge, the redeemers find themselves both catalysts and agents of change in this ever-evolving tapestry of faiths and religions.</text>

      <name>Preachers, Merchants and Community Leaders</name>
      <text>and Community Leaders The redeemers, as heavenly conduits of the divine twins Tamera and Bauron, navigate the intricacies of Tanares with their celestial gifts, which manifest as both transcendent oratory and preternatural sagacity. These divine emissaries, with their captivating presence, serve as harbingers of the gods' wisdom and custodians of sacred relics.
	By day, most redeemers traverse the social tapestry, pursuing their celestial mandates while tending to their communities, confronting the Ungods' corruption, and bestowing their blessings upon the deserving. As influential orators, they amass devout adherents who heed their inspiring exegeses of sacred texts and dreams, forging new communities and sanctuaries that espouse their doctrines.
	Understanding the significance of wealth in furthering their divine mission, redeemers often embrace roles as prosperous merchants or astute investors. However, they perceive riches as a means to an end—a vessel through which to channel their blessings and advance their cause—rather than an object of materialistic desire.
	The redeemers' ethical compass transcends the confines of earthly institutions, often placing them at odds with established religious orders such as the Celestianist Church. Despite these tensions, some redeemers ally with the Church to amplify their influence, while others retain their independence, disseminating their personal interpretations of scripture and gathering followers as prophetic visionaries.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Prophetic Dreams</name>
      <text>The dreams of the redeemers are steeped in mystique, woven from ethereal reveries and enigmatic signs gifted by their celestial patrons, Tamera and Bauron. Unlike the unwavering conduits of the divine, who draw upon celestial energies through steadfast devotion, the redeemers first awaken their spellcasting prowess amidst visions of resplendent grandeur, infused with the very essence of divinity.

The recent resurgence of the angels saw them confirmed the divine origins of the redeemers' dreams and visions, emphasizing the need for discerning interpretation. Yet, the myriad conclaves of the redeemers are far from immune to internal strife. A great number of beliefs unfurl, as some advocate for collective endeavors to decipher the cryptic symbols embedded within the revelations, asserting that the wisdom of the most exalted should guide the interpretations. In stark contrast, others extol the merits of individual sovereignty, resolute in their belief that each redeemer must divine the meaning of their own visions, as the gods intended solely for the chosen recipient and no other.

This divergence of convictions gives birth to factions within the hallowed halls of the redeemers' temples, underscoring the unique nature of each redeemer's visions as they embark upon their sacred missions. Despite the turbulence, an atmosphere of mutual respect prevails, with the majority acknowledging the divine gifts of their brethren, united by their shared vocation to shepherd and uplift the denizens of Tanares and their unyielding bond with Tamera and Bauron.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Redeemer Dreams</name>
      <text>The redeemers possess a rare gift, one that allows them to receive prophetic dreams and visions from the gods. These dreams are not only meant to inspire and guide the redeemers themselves, but to aid and motivate others as well. The Dream Table outlines the different styles of these dreams in vivid detail, from the Empowering and Enlightening to the Lucid and Nightmarish. Each style is accompanied by a short description, a common use in campaigns, including an explanation of why the gods might choose to send such a dream, and an example of what one might look like.

These dreams can be a powerful tool in the hands of a skilled GM, one who can use them to weave a rich tapestry of story and character development. But they should not be viewed as a shortcut or a means of bypassing important plot elements. Instead, they should be employed to help players deal with unsolved challenging puzzles or overlooked plot hooks. The gods should always be on the side of the redeemers, guiding them towards success, but never at the expense of overall enjoyment of all players.

Style of Dream | Description | Use | Example
Empowering:
The redeemer has complete mastery over their powers and abilities in a dream, and utilizes them to achieve great victories, exploring their full potential.
	Allows the redeemer to see where they are failing to best utilize their skills and how to implement better strategies. The gods use this method to empower the redeemer and help them grow in power and skill.
	The redeemer failed in a recent encounter because they didn't know how to use their powers effectively. In an Empowering dream, they are shown how to better utilize their abilities, waking with newfound confidence.

Enlightening:
The redeemer experiences a profound moment of insight or clarity, allowing them to understand a previously unknown truth.
	Provides the redeemer with information that they did not have previously, allowing them to solve a puzzle, understand a situation, or make an important decision. The gods use this method to reveal hidden knowledge and provide the redeemer with greater understanding.
	The redeemer has been trying to uncover the secret of a puzzling letter, but neither they nor their friends can solve it. In a dream, the gods show a clue that helps them connect the dots and identify the solution.

Lucid:
The redeemer realizes that they are dreaming and can control their actions in the dream, as if they were awake.
	Allows the redeemer to explore new scenarios, try out new abilities, or have a fun diversion from the campaign. The gods use this method to allow the redeemer to have a personal experience with them or other servants of the gods, in a place separate from the events of the physical world.
	The redeemer has been feeling stressed out and burned out from the amount of combat and traps they are facing in a dungeon. In a dream, they have a relaxing vacation in a tropical paradise, where they interact with different people that may provide new information or quests.

Nightmarish:
The redeemer is plagued by terrible visions of death, destruction, or loss.
	Creates tension, provides a warning, or sets up future events. The gods use this method to instill a sense of urgency or fear in the redeemer, motivating them to act.
	The redeemer has been feeling uneasy about a recent peace treaty signed with a neighboring nation. In a dream, they see a terrible vision of the treaty falling apart as one of the diplomats dies.

Past Life:
The redeemer experiences a dream that seems to be from a past life or the life of an ancestor, providing them with insight into past history or about their own origins.
	Provides the redeemer with information about their character's past or provides them with insight into their own personal history. The gods use this method to provide the redeemer with information they lack about their own roots or to help them understand an important aspect of their character's backstory.
	The redeemer has a dream where they see themselves as a priestess in a long-ago battle and learn that the death knight that is now their enemy was once her beloved husband, who fell by the blades of its own traitorous comrades he swore to protect.

Prophetic:
The redeemer has a cryptic dream about a future event filled with symbolism and prophetic messages that are all connected to a critical situation they are in or will be in.
	This dream is useful for challenging the redeemer's ability to interpret signs and connect information, creating puzzles, and communicating a specific message or warning about the future. The gods use this method to ensure their intervention does not supersede mortal free will and agency.
	The redeemer dreams of a looming invasion of their home city and sees symbols and flashes of specific scenes, such as a golden glass filled with wine, a crown with 7 rubies, and a light pointing south. These symbols may mean that the culprit is one of the 7 lords of the south, the one known for its vineyard, leading the redeemer to investigate and interpret the signs to prevent the invasion.

Prophetic Warning:
The redeemer experiences a clear and direct vision that warns them of an impending disaster or danger, providing a clear goal, path, and call to action.
	This dream is useful for giving the redeemer a warning they can act upon and providing a clear command to intercede on a specific situation. The gods use this method to guide mortals in preventing disasters or preparing for upcoming events.
	The redeemer dreams of a dragon attacking a town at dawn, giving them the chance to return and prevent the disaster they missed due to not noticing the clues previously.

Recurring:
The redeemer has the same dream multiple times, with minor differences each time, providing a major long-term goal and small bits of help as they advance towards it.
	This dream is useful for providing the redeemer with a sense of direction and culminating in a big climax for their story. The gods use this method to guide mortals on long journeys.
	The redeemer dreams of standing in front of a mysterious locked door with a different symbol on it each time, gaining new information to interpret the symbol and ultimately unlocking the door to reveal its secret.</text>

      <name>Creating a Redeemer</name>
      <text>The first step to creating your redeemer is to define their personal beliefs. While their power originates from the gods, it's important to consider what they believe the gods want from them and any prophetic dreams they may have had. Not all redeemers know precisely where their powers come from; they simply know that they are fueled by gold and other emotion-infused material goods. By defining your redeemer's beliefs, you can map out the discourse they will adopt—one of divine salvation or personal fulfillment, for example.

Once you have established your redeemer's beliefs, consider what they do with the gold they receive. Do they use their powers to help people in the best way possible, fulfilling their desires? Or do they move from town to town, collecting gold from the desperate and becoming rich? Do they view other redeemers as competitors or potential allies who can help them solve people's problems?

Finally, it's important to define what led your character into the life of adventure. Were they seeking an easier way to obtain gold and artifacts? Did they have a divine dream that drove them to adventure? Are they looking for protection by being part of a team, or do they want to gather an army to prepare for the Armageddon? Perhaps they seek to spread the word of the gods to as many people as possible. Whatever the case, understanding your redeemer's motivations and beliefs will help you create a rich and engaging character for your campaign.</text>

When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of your new class's starting proficiencies, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a redeemer.

	• Armor: light armor
	• Skills: one skill from the class's skill list</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Multiclass Features</name>
        <text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does).
	Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared:
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.
	Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
	If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots:
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
	If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.
	For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic:
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

      <feature>
        <name>Spellcasting</name>
        <text>You have been blessed by the gods who have granted you divine powers, so that you are capable of casting cleric spells.

Cantrips:
You know four cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Redeemer Spells Known column of the Redeemer table.

Spell Slots:
The redeemer table shows how many spell slots of 1st level and higher you have available to cast spells. To cast one of these spells, you must spend a spell slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all spent spell slots when you complete a long rest.
	For example, if you want to cast the 1st-level spell bless and you have one 1st-level spell slot and one 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast bless using either spell slot.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the cleric spell list. The Spells Known column of the Redeemer table shows when you learn more cleric spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For example, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one cleric spell you know and replace it with another spell from the cleric spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability:
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells, since the power of your magic depends on your ability to project the divine magic within you into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

Ritual Casting:
You can cast any cleric spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag in its description.

Spell Focus:
You can use any gold coin as a focus for your cleric spells.

      <feature>
        <name>Rays</name>
        <text>As a redeemer, your greatest weapons are your rays, which shoot directly from your hands. Starting at 1st level, you can fire a Positive or Negative ray using your action, as long as you have at least one free hand. Your rays have a range of 60 feet and must target a single creature.

Positive Ray. Must target a willing creature. Grants 1d4 temporary hit points, which last for 1 minute. Note that temporary hit points don't stack, but instead replace each other, as per the general rule for temporary hit points.
	The temporary hit points granted by the ray change to 2d4 at 5th level in this class, 3d4 at 11th level, and 4d4 at 17th level.

Negative Ray. Make a ranged spell attack against the target creature, dealing 1d6 necrotic damage on a hit. This damage ignores any immunity or resistance the creature has if it's an unnatural creature. In Tanares, unnatural creatures are those not created by Tamera and/or Bauron, such as penumbral creatures, Ungods, undead, and aberrations. If you're playing in another setting, talk to your GM to decide what types of creatures fit this definition.

The damage caused by your ray changes to 2d6 at 5th level in this class, 3d6 at 11th level, and 4d6 at 17th level.

        <name>Magic In Rays</name>
        <text>Starting at 1st level, while wearing light or no armor and not carrying a shield, you can use your action to cast a spell (including cantrips) using one of your rays. If you do, your spell affects a single target determined by the type of ray used, and the spell's range adapts to the ray's range. However, you must still meet all other requirements for casting the spell and using the ray.
	You can use this ability a number of times equal to 1 plus your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it after a short or long rest.
	If the spell requires a saving throw and the ray needs an attack roll, make the attack roll first. If the attack hits, the target is affected by the spell and must then make the saving throw, as indicated in the spell's description.
	For example, if you are a 4th-level redeemer and use this ability to cast blindness/deafness using a 2nd-level spell slot, the spell's range increases to 60 feet instead of its normal range of 30 feet. You must make a ranged spell attack against the target, dealing 1d6 necrotic damage on a hit. The target must also make a Constitution saving throw or become blinded or deafened, as described in the spell's description. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

	During a short rest, you can alter your spell list, including cantrips from this class, sacrificing 1 gold piece per level of each spell changed in this way (minimum 1 per spell).

You can also attempt a Charisma ability check contested by the creature's Wisdom. If successful, you ascertain whether the creature's challenge rating or character level is significantly lower (-4 or more), slightly lower (-1 to -3), equal, slightly higher (+1 to +3), or significantly higher (+4 or more) than your level. If this would uncover a secret, the GM may decide to make you aware of the existence of a secret but not what it entails.

Decay | The target takes only half of all damage caused by the ray and the spell, but becomes cursed by your magic for 1 minute. At the end of each of the creature's turns, it takes half the damage again, then it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw to end this effect.
Despair | You instill the fear of the world-end on the creature. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1d4 rounds.
Omen | Before the target creature makes a saving throw against your spell, choose two numbers between 2 and 20. If the creature's roll equals either of the chosen numbers, it automatically fails the saving throw. If the creature has advantage on the saving throw, use the highest of its two rolls. If the creature has disadvantage on the saving throw, use the lowest of its two rolls.
Apocalypse | All other creatures within 10 feet of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they are affected by the spell (but not your ray) as if they were the original target. You must make any necessary attack rolls, saving throws, or decisions for each affected creature, as if casting the spell against that target.

In addition, controlling the emotions of the masses ensures that wars are less likely to happen. Shepherds are excellent leaders of crowds, often religious leaders, prophets, and healers.

        <name>Cycle Of Redemption (Shepherd)</name>
        <text>At 2nd level, you receive a special marking on your character sheet called the Cycle of Redemption. The position to which you move the marker on the Cycle, when you use one of your rays, will guarantee you a unique benefit, which will last until the beginning of your next turn.
	After taking a long rest, you determine your starting position on the Cycle and then place a marker on your character sheet in the chosen position. You move this marker every time you declare firing one of your Rays. The position you will be in at the end of this move will determine the benefit you will receive until the beginning of your next turn. You do not receive any benefits if you did not use your action to perform a ray in your turn.
	The movement happens before the ray is shot, so all benefits to moving in a new position are applied before the ray is used. This movement still happens if you are using Magic in Rays, and is also applied before the spell is cast.

        <name>Crowd Leader (Shepherd)</name>
        <text>Starting at 15th level, your role as a Shepherd provides you with exceptional skills in engaging with crowds and building trust with individual members. When making a Charisma (Performance) check to interact with a non-hostile group of at least three creatures, you can add your proficiency bonus in Deception or Persuasion to the check in addition to your proficiency in Performance. If the check succeeds, you capture the absolute attention of the creatures, instilling trust in them during the interaction, and they have a disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks for anything besides you during this period.

        <name>Mob Mentality (Shepherd)</name>
        <text>At 18th level, you can once per day influence a group of creatures by bending their will to your commands. Any individual who can hear and comprehend your speech for 1 minute must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature that fails will pursue the course of action you described as if affected by the suggestion spell, behaving this way until the order is completed or 7 days have passed. The course of action must be expressed in one or two sentences, and follows the same restrictions and limitations as the suggestion spell.
	This effect isn't considered magical but is instead the result of your powerful persuasiveness, so affected creatures will feel persuaded rather than enchanted or manipulated. Affected creatures have advantage on saving throws against any effect that would compel them to act against your suggestion.
