      <name>Madwalker</name>
      <text>I n the Penumbral Plane, a dwarf crawls inside a nest of arachnid aberrations. Swarmed by monsters, he easily shrugs off their attacks. When he finally sees the queen, the dwarf shapeshifts into an arachne himself and handily defeats his opponent.
	While fighting in an Arena match, a gnome makes an aberrant tentacle grow from his back. Using it to cross a pit with a series of acrobatic moves, he lands right by his enemies. Grinning, he grapples his opponents with the tentacle and throws them one by one into the pit, ensuring his Team's victory.
	A human is pursued by the Ironhand. Her crime? Existing. As she is surrounded by guards, a pair of twisted wings sprout from her back. She takes flight and leaves town, knowing that on her back are not only tentacles or wings, but a target.
	Shadowy and agile guides and hunters of the Penumbral Plane who hate penumbral creatures. They wield aberrant powers, but at the cost of their sanity, walking a thin line between power and madness.
	The madwalkers, survivors of the Penumbral Plane's malevolent embrace, are individuals forever marked by their terrifying experiences with abominations spawned by the vile influence of the Ungods. Their fractured minds bear the scars of unspeakable horrors, yet they have harnessed the dark energies of the Penumbra to exact retribution upon the loathsome progeny of the Ungods. Their mastery of this mysterious force and the resilience forged in the depths of their insanity makes them formidable champions in the eternal struggle against the encroaching darkness.
	To earn the powers of a madwalker, an initiate must undergo a terrifying rite of passage, confronting and vanquishing either Watchers or arachnes, before attuning to their essence by absorbing their power. Occasionally, this transformation transpires spontaneously when individuals seeking vengeance become trapped within the Penumbral Plane, fighting for their lives and slaying aberrant creatures to survive. However, a knowledgeable mentor can shepherd the initiate through this process, enabling them to deliberately overcome their monstrous adversaries, assimilate their energy, and assume the mantle of a madwalker.
	The source of a madwalker's power determines their abilities and the path they tread. The Nightmare's Augury Trail, achieved by hunting and assimilating the essence of a servant of Golgöggoth, the Augur and master of the Watchers, grants madwalkers foresight and exceptional mental fortitude, as well as daunting defensive prowess. Conversely, the Aberrant Arachinid Trail, obtained by hunting and assimilating the essence of an arachnid servant of Bellera, the Ungods' progeny, bestows upon madwalkers unmatched hunting expertise, empowering them to orchestrate lethal ambushes and wield potent toxins against their prey.
	Ostracized by society as deranged and tainted, madwalkers dwell on the fringes of civilization. Yet their unique ability to withstand the Penumbra's insidious corruption, navigate its treacherous landscapes, and confront its dark horrors with lethal precision make them invaluable allies to mighty kingdoms and influential organizations.
	Delving into the abyss of their own madness, madwalkers manifest their innermost nightmares in corporeal form. At the zenith of their insanity, they can temporarily assume the guise of a penumbral monstrosity, granting them immense power. However, this metamorphosis demands a terrible price, leaving them enfeebled in its aftermath.
	The madwalker's journey is a precarious balancing act between their humanity and the source of their power — the insanity that threatens to consume them. They navigate a treacherous path fraught with daunting challenges as they strive to maintain their sanity while wielding the unfettered power of their nightmares. Those who master this power can unleash a force beyond the comprehension of mere mortals.

      <name>Madwalker History</name>
      <text>In the shadowy annals of Tanares' history, the genesis of the madwalkers traces back to the Ancient Age, a bygone era where intrepid mortals dared to probe the enigmatic Penumbral Plane. These forays, aimed at combating the ceaseless menace of penumbral monstrosities, were often led by individuals fueled by vengeance against the insidious offspring of the Ungods. As they ventured into the twisted depths of this Penumbral Plane, these tormented souls were tainted and driven to the brink of insanity by confrontations with grotesque, aberrant horrors. Only a sparse few of those who endured and narrowly evaded becoming aberrations themselves were left so irrevocably warped that they were transformed into the first madwalkers.
	As the sands of time relentlessly marched forward, these enigmatic warriors fractured into two factions, each drawn to disparate sources of power. One faction pursued the malignant might of the Arachnes, malevolent minions of the Ungods, believing that mastering their adversaries' power would bring about ultimate retribution. The other faction yearned for the essence of the Watchers, fallen angels in servitude to Golgöggoth, the Augur. These tainted beings could defy the Ungods' servants, their energy morphing into a formidable weapon.
	These factions harbored disdain for one another, each unwavering in their conviction of their chosen path's dominance. Arachnid madwalkers derided the Augury faction as feeble, incapable of withstanding corruption. Conversely, Augury madwalkers loathed utilizing their enemies' power, contending that the Watchers' essence is more closely aligned with their righteous, vengeful crusade.
	Throughout the history, madwalkers were cast out as tainted pariahs, yet they persisted on the fringes of society, lurking in Tanares' penumbral recesses to hunt the abominations they swore to annihilate. For centuries, the Evolutionist Church, ensnared in the Ungods' duplicitous web, pursued the madwalkers as heretics. This persecution persisted through the dark and grim Fallen Age until the dawning of the Imperial Age.
	A recent turning tide came when several resurgent angels unveiled the gods' true intentions, unmasking the Ungods' deceit inside the Evolutionist Church. This revelation sparked the transformation of the Church into the Celestianist Church, which began to perceive madwalkers as potential allies. The Awakened, an elite monster-hunting order within the Church, incorporated numerous madwalkers, bolstering their ranks and elevating their status in the ongoing struggle against the Ungods.</text>

      <name>Fighting Madness with Madness</name>
      <text>with Madness The madwalkers hold the ability to harness the chaotic essence of their fragmented psyche, channeling the eldritch terrors of the Penumbra as potent weapons. These tainted warriors stand unbowed in the relentless battle against the festering malignancy that lurks deep within the world's core. Bound to the Penumbra by the torment of their shattered minds, madwalkers possess an innate sense for detecting penumbral beings, portals, and rifts, allowing them to relentlessly pursue their prey through the darkest recesses of existence.
	Masterful madwalkers wield the power to conjure temporary penumbral rifts—interdimensional gateways that forge a tenuous connection between the nightmarish realm and the Material Plane. This unparalleled mastery makes them invaluable allies in the age-old struggle against the dreaded Ungods, as they can skillfully enter or exit the Penumbral Plane to confront the eldritch horrors that lie hidden within.
	However, the Penumbra's power demands a dire sacrifice. Madwalkers teeter precariously on the brink between the fragile bounds of sanity and the unfathomable abyss of madness. In moments of utmost desperation, a madwalker may choose to embrace their darkest nightmares, undergoing a horrifying transfiguration into a fearsome penumbral monstrosity. This metamorphosis allows them to assume the form of one of the many penumbral creatures, such as emoguns, Watchers, or even arachnes, depending on their source of power. In doing so, they gain immense strength and resilience, but at the perilous cost of potentially succumbing to the Penumbra's all-consuming lunacy</text>

      <name>The Whispers of the Penumbral Plane</name>
      <text>Penumbral Plane In the uncharted depths of the cosmos, where the mortal realm's influence wanes, lies the Penumbral Plane. This eldritch and twisted dimension, born of the corruption wrought by the vile Ungods, unfurls into six distinct layers—each a haunting echo of a plane devoured by the Ungods' insatiable hunger for planar domination. This realm teems with macabre denizens, including insidious cultists, tainted penumbral dragons, and distorted emoguns—sullied souls of mortals whose dying hearts were consumed by sins and darkness.
	The Surface is cloaked in an enigmatic shroud of mists, reflecting a warped simulacrum of Tanares, and ruled by the enigmatic penumbral dragons. The mists possess a potent corruptive power, and even the most deranged madwalkers steer clear of this forsaken place. Numerous cavern entrances and pathways offer temporary refuge from the mists and the dreadful penumbral dragons that hunt the skies above.
	The Eternal Cathedral, the first layer of the Penumbra, extends infinitely as a vast, shadowy sanctuary. Once sacred, it now echoes with the whispers of the damned. Filled with crumbling altars, toppled statues, and rotting libraries, this formerly holy realm is ruled by Gideoni, the fallen High Cardinal of the Evolutionist Church, now leader of the Cult of Shadow Wing and the chosen of The Mystical One. Commanding legions of devout cultists and emoguns driven by fear and pain, Gideoni's power casts a dark pall over the cathedral.
	Delving deeper, the Caverns of the Magma Giants sprawl as a labyrinthine network of colossal tunnels and chambers, riddled with rivers and lakes of molten lava. Amidst the ruins of forgotten cities and fortresses, constructed by powerful and thriftless giants, now reside emoguns empowered by wrath and gluttony, alongside other twisted beasts spawned by the Fleshspawner himself. Ardillog, the Everspawning Chimera, watches over this fiery domain with a vigilant eye, ever prepared to be summoned to the material plane at its bestial master's behest.
	Descending further, the Crystal Forest emerges. Within its gleaming, narrow tunnels and cavernous expanses, one encounters crystalline flora that shimmer and resonate with eerie vibrations, all filled with spider webs. Bellara, mistress of this crystalline expanse, leads an army of arachnes and emoguns that feed on grudge and pride; they hide in the webs, ready to hunt the unwary.
	The Endless City, the fourth layer, sprawls across a desolate expanse the size of a continent. This once-grand world-sized metropolis now lies in ruin, its narrow streets, alleys, and decrepit buildings overtaken by shadows. Catharina, servant of the Lady of Sins, presides over this decayed realm, conspiring with Bellara as they command covens of Purple Witches and powerful hags that transform entire sections of the ancient city into swampy lands filled with sewage water, mutated rats, and emoguns spawned by lust and disgust, ensnaring invaders with illusions and enticing their curiosity to curse them with hexes.
	Treading deeper still, the Clock Level reveals itself as an endless array of bronze gears and mechanisms, its passages opening and closing with clockwork precision, creating a labyrinth of gears, levers, and shifting walls. The emoguns here rejoice on sloth and sadness, wandering this domain. Ruled by the First Queen, the ancient hive mother of the Kikoku, her swarm hides in all crevices of the endless gears that form this level, ready to attack or seize control of the many ancient bronze constructs and assail invaders in the territory of their Queen.
	At last, the Inverted Archives await. Within this enigmatic realm where gravity is inverted and ancient library rooms are connected only through one-way metallic mirrors that serve as portals, the Dark Collector, master of this domain, presides over a group of sinister hoarders who have succumbed to corruption; they command all penumbral creatures in the archives, which teem with emoguns that prey on greed and envy.
	Sparse respite can be found in this dark realm, with a few Dragon Council Towers hidden in secure places across the different levels, a handful of rare gloomfolk tribes that maintain small territories for themselves, and a few surviving collectors that have resisted corruption. These small and elusive individuals are difficult to communicate with, as they are more likely to flee than to engage in conversation or combat. However, they may offer refuge to those who are gravely weakened or visibly wounded.</text>

      <name>The Madwalkers and the World</name>
      <text>The enigmatic madwalkers tread a path shrouded in mystery and fear, their existence once maligned by the zealous crusade of the dominant Evolutionist Church. In the wake of scandals unveiling the Ungods' corruption within the Church's core, the reformed Celestianist Church has adopted a more subtle stance, tolerating the madwalkers while withholding public support as it labors to restore its tarnished reputation.
	The madwalkers' minds, frayed by their connection to the ominous penumbral beings, inspire disquiet among the populace who tremble before their unnerving abilities and unsettling visage. Yet, it is this very instability that grants them the power to empathize with those whose sanity has been ravaged by the abominations of the Penumbral Plane, extracting invaluable knowledge where others flounder.
	Possessing a singular, twisted perspective, they devise tactics and strategies that confound even the most brilliant of minds. This uncanny ability to discern hidden patterns renders the most exceptional madwalkers highly sought after by organizations and kingdoms seeking to shatter conventional paradigms with groundbreaking insights.
	As they navigate the cities of Tanares, madwalkers are ever mindful of the need for discretion. They cloak themselves in shadows, acutely aware that common folk can sense the disturbing penumbral aura that envelops them.
	In the forsaken outskirts, where society's outcasts huddle together, madwalkers find a semblance of solace. Amidst these dark fringes, they escape the judging eyes of the people, forging a tenuous sense of belonging in a world that would otherwise cast them aside. Their shared experience of being pariahs nurtures a sense of brotherhood among them, while their similarly warped minds exchange ideas through fleeting glances and subtle gestures that only they can comprehend.
	To earn a living, many madwalkers hunt penumbral creatures, presenting their slain quarry to the Dragon Towers as evidence of their victories and claiming bounties offered by the Draconic Council. Although the pervasive fear surrounding them stifles any hope for public acclaim or positions of influence, a select few madwalkers maintain an artful facade, concealing their true nature as they excel in their chosen fields. These few can become powerful nobles, seen as eccentric by others, and are able to fund and provide protection to many aspiring madwalkers.
	Simultaneously, factions entangled in Tanares' cold war covet the singular prowess of the madwalkers, enlisting them as assassins and infiltrators in covert operations. Their actions reverberate throughout the societies they traverse, bearing far-reaching consequences.</text>

      <name>Creating a Madwalker</name>
      <text>To create a madwalker character, start by deciding how you became a madwalker. What brought you to the plane of nightmares? How you acquired your powers, you had a mentor or you survived alone the horrors of the plane of nightmares?
Did you seek out its power, or were you pulled in by accident?
How your newfound abilities and your changed mental state affected your daily life, and what sort of relationship do you have with the people from your past?
	In addition to backstory, it's important to consider your madwalker's personality. Are they playful and mischievous, or dark and brooding? Do they revel in their powers or feel a sense of guilt and responsibility for what they can do?
	Finally, think about how your madwalker fits into the larger world. Do they have allies or enemies who know about their powers? Are they hunted by those who fear their abilities, or sought after by those who desire their power? Why are you adventuring? Vengeance against an evil being, desire for power and wealth, or for some other personal reason?

In Other Settings:
As long as there are nightmares in your setting, a madwalker can tap into its oneiric fabric and embody its creations; it is therefore not only possible, but easy, to play as a madwalker in other settings. Even though only a few minor powers of a madwalker relate to the Penumbral Plane, many other settings have similar dark or astral environments that you can treat as if they were the madwalker's penumbra, such as the Shadowfell.</text>

        <name>Multiclass Features</name>
        <text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does).
	Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared:
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.
	Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
	If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots:
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
	If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.
	For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic:
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

        <name>Insanity Effects (Optional Rule)</name>
        <text>Insanity Effects When the madwalker advances in one of the first three Insanity Steps, they must also roll a d8 to determine how their mind is being affected by madness.
	At 1st level, the madwalker can choose 1 to 3 of the following effects to not be part of the insanities they are subject to.
	When advancing an Insanity Step, the madwalker rolls a d8 and checks the Insanity Effects table. If they roll the number of one of the types of madness they chose not to be subject to, they advance each of the effects they are already suffering by one level. If they are not suffering any effect, nothing happens.
	Whenever this roll results in one of the effects they did not remove from their list, they gain a level of that madness, suffering its bonuses and penalties. If they are already suffering from that madness, they advance it to the next level, adding a new effect. If they are already at the second level of that madness, nothing happens.
	The effects of each level of madness are cumulative and end if the madwalker takes a long rest.

Insanity Effects:
D8 Result | Insanity Effects
Delirant (1) | You see and hear things that no one else does, convening hidden meanings. You have disadvantage on all Wisdom ability checks but gain advantage on all intelligence ones. The things you see and hear speak to you, inciting you to do as they say. At the start of your turn roll a die, if it's even you add 1d4 to all rolls in your turn, if it's odd you subtract 1d4 of all rolls in your turn.
Maniacal (2) | You find the world around you fun. Whenever an ally fails a saving throw or attack, you gain +1 to attack rolls and -1 to AC until the end of your next turn. The whole existence is a joke, and you laugh in the face of danger. You have -1 to your AC, but your attacks deal +1 damage and you are immune to being stunned, incapacitated and to sleep effects.
Enraged (3) | Your anger makes clear to others that they should not bother you. You automatically fail any Charisma (Persuasion) check, but you have advantage on all Charisma (Intimidation) checks. When your anger explodes, you become a crazy beast, hurting yourself and everyone in your way. All your melee weapon attacks do +2 damage, but they also cause you to take 2 damage that cannot be resisted or reduced in any way
Fearful (4) | You see the world's dangers as they truly are, making you very cautious. You have disadvantage on all initiative checks, but you cannot be surprised and you have +2 AC until the start of your first turn on each combat. You know that they are after you. You gain +1 to AC and on all saving throws, but your fear also cripples your actions. You have -1 to all attack rolls and ability checks.
Sadistic (5) | You like to see others suffering. At the start of your turn, if there is an enemy adjacent to you and you can attack it, you feel the need to harm it in some way. All attacks made to cause harm against one of such enemies have a +1 on the attack roll, and all actions that are not done to cause harm to one of them have -1 to all its rolls. You like to kill other people. On your turn, whenever a non-allied creature adjacent to you has 0 HP, you have disadvantage on all rolls on your turn that are not made with the intention to kill that creature. If you kill it, you regain hit points equal to half your level (rounded up).
Fanatic (6) | You know the powers from beyond that talk to you in your nightmares. You are one of their chosen. You immediately gain Insanity Points equal to 1 + half your madwalker level (rounded up), but your Insanity Steps don't cause penalties to your saving throws. The ancient entities feed you with unfathomable power. Your Insanity Steps penalty increases by -1, but once per turn you can add 1d6 psychic damage to an attack or aberrant mutation that causes damage.
Gloomy (7) | You feel sad, and don't really feel the need to place effort into things. You always consider that you rolled a 10 on all ability checks. Nothing really matters to you, and all is pointless. You don't apply ability modifiers on any damage roll you make. Reduce all damage caused to you by 5 (to a minimum of 1).
Narcissistic (8) | You know how great you are, but you cannot accept when others cause you to fail. When you hit an enemy you gain +1 to attack rolls until you miss an attack (the bonus doesn't stack). When you miss an attack on an enemy, you gain -1 to attack rolls until you hit an attack (it doesn't stack). Someone like you cannot be touched by lesser beings. You have +1 AC, but whenever an attack hits you, you take 1d4 extra psychic damage. This damage ignores immunities, resistances, and cannot be reduced in any way

        <name>Aberrant Mutation</name>
        <text>You can produce unimaginable temporary modifications to your body, known as Aberrant Mutations. Some of them require the target(s) to roll a saving throw to resist their effects.

	Aberrant Mutation save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Known Aberrant Mutations:
At 1st level, you know the Dark Energy 1st-level Aberrant Mutation and two other 1st-level Aberrant Mutations of your choice from the list later in this section. You may learn a new Aberrant Mutation at every odd level in the madwalker class, as shown in the madwalker table on page 139. If you wish, when you gain a madwalker level, you may choose one Aberrant Mutation that you already know and replace it with another.
	Each of your Aberrant Mutations must be of a level no higher than your madwalker level allows. For example, when you reach 5th level of the class,you can learn a new Aberrant Mutation of 1st or 2nd level, but you cannot know more than four Aberrant Mutations.
	You can use only one Aberrant Mutation per round, but you can have more than one of them active.

Insanity Points:
Madwalkers delve deeper and deeper into the realms of madness as they use their powers. After activating an Aberrant Mutation, at the end of your turn you acquire the number of Insanity Points stated in its description.
	Once you amass a specified number of Insanity Points, you receive a penalty to your AC and all attacks and saving throws, as shown in the Insanity Steps table. When you reach maximum Insanity, you transform into a Penumbral Shape. After the transformation ends, you remain at maximum Insanity and stop gaining points (keeping the penalties).
	You lose all Insanity Points after finishing a long rest.

Insanity Steps:
Total Penalty to Attacks, AC and Saves | Insanity Points (1st to 4th Levels) | Insanity Points (5th to 8th Levels) | Insanity Points (9th to 12th Levels) | Insanity Points (13th to 16th Levels) | Insanity Points (17th to 20th Levels)
-1 penalty | 3 to 5 | 6 to 11 | 9 to 17 | 12 to 23 | 15 to 29
-2 penalty | 6 to 8 | 12 to 17 | 18 to 26 | 24 to 35 | 30 to 44
-3 penalty | 9 or more | 18 or more | 27 or more | 36 or more | 45 or more
Penumbral Shape | 12 (maximum) | 24 (maximum) | 36 (maximum) | 48 (maximum) | 60 (maximum)

        <text>Starting at 1st level, when you reach the maximum number of Insanity Points indicated on the table, your shape becomes that of a penumbral creature for as many minutes as your madwalker level. You automatically revert to your normal form if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.
	Each level grants you access to new Penumbral Shapes, according to the following table:

You have access to the basic shapes and, starting at 2nd level, you also have access to the shapes from your Trail of Madness, as shown in the table. When this ability activates, choose and transform into one of the basic or trail shapes available. If there is not enough space for your chosen shape to fit, the transformation fails and you lose its use.
	While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

	• All attacks, damaging spells, and effects from your shape deal 1d4 extra damage, increasing to 2d4 at 6th level, 3d4 at 12th level, and 4d4 at 18th level.

	• Your game statistics are replaced by those of the penumbral creature, but you retain your alignment, personality, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining the creature's Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throw proficiencies, and all other proficiencies it may have. If the penumbral creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours.

	• While in your Penumbral Shape, you may not activate Aberrant Mutations, cast spells, or use any of your original form's features. Any active Aberrant Mutation ends immediately. Except for your proficiencies, mental abilities, and Blades of Madness feature, you only have access to the features of your Penumbral Shape.

	• The Insanity Steps table penalties do not apply while in this form.

	• The transformation automatically interrupts your concentration in spells and features you may have already cast or activated.

	• When you transform, you assume the creature's maximum hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if your Penumbral Shape has 1 hit point left and you take 10 damage, you revert and your normal form takes 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.

	• When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature's shape and size. The equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

	• You ignore Tamera's Light (that deals damage to penumbral creatures while exposed to direct daylight)

Madwalkers that follow this path are not only feared but also hated by the Arachnes. The gruesome ritual they undergo attunes them to the energies of Ungods and the Arachnes, harnessing their vicious powers by taking the heart of an Arachne, a price paid willingly for power.
	These madwalkers move through the shadows, sensing and manipulating the chaotic vibrations of the Penumbral Plane, blades dripping with deadly poison, and hands weaving sticky webs that ensnare prey. They feed on their victim's fear, savoring the scent of terror that fills the air before they strike with unmatched intensity and aggression.
	Their transformations are an affront to all that is natural, becoming horrid, fearsome exemplars of cunning and viciousness. The resulting humanoid-spider hybrids are chaotic deadly creatures that send shivers down the spine of even the bravest warriors, their presence alone an omen of a horrible fate. These madwalkers revel in their sinister powers, embracing their chaos and savoring the taste of their prey's terror as they move through the shadows, always aware of the price they pay for their power.
	With their senses attuned to the deep hunger of the spiders, the madwalkers that follow this path move through the Penumbral Plane as deadly predators, always on the hunt for their next victim.

Madwalkers that follow this path have delved into darkness, seeking the strength of the Watchers, natural enemies of all other penumbral creatures, so they can gain power to destroy them. By taking the heart of one of Augur's Watchers, they have unlocked the energies of the Penumbral Plane, transforming themselves into twisted beings of immense power.
	Though the Watchers regard them as mere nuisances, these madwalkers relish their newfound might.
	With their senses attuned to Augur's powers of vision and dark prophecy, these madwalkers move through the shadows with sinister intent. Their intuition predicts future events with eerie accuracy, and they can see what no other mortal can perceive.
	Their transformation is a grotesque and horrifying spectacle, turning them into floating creatures of writhing tentacles and spikes, covered in sinister scales, with a massive mouth filled with serrated teeth that feed on the pain and suffering of their victims. Their minds become even more twisted and focused in this state, consumed by thoughts of domination and control.
	Some of these madwalkers struggle against their nature, seeking to use their power for good, but others succumb to their darkest desires, using their might to oppress and dominate others. Nevertheless, many of these dark beings have turned their eyes towards heroism, using their fearsome abilities to fight against the very darkness that empowers them.
	Their very presence strikes fear in the hearts of their enemies, and their power is unmatched. They pay a terrible price for it, but they do not regret their path, as they continue to grow stronger, becoming even more powerful as they move through the penumbra with their newfound abilities.
