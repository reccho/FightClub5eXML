      <name>Description</name>
      <text>You were living a difficult life before your destiny suddenly changed through a miraculous turn of good fortune. Perhaps a benevolent deity gave you precisely what you most desired. You might have stumbled across a Deck of Many Things and drawn a card with a potent, positive effect. Or maybe you inherited a modest fortune from a distant relative you didn't know you had.
	Regardless, you left the daily miseries of your old life behind in favor of a life of adventure and excitement. Your old debts have been paid, responsibilities you thought inescapable are behind you, or you suddenly possess rare and unusual skills unknown to ordinary folk.

	• Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Persuasion
	• Tool Proficiencies: One gaming set of your choice (such as playing cards or three-dragon ante cards)
	• Languages: One of your choice
	• Equipment: A bottle of black ink, an ink pen, five sheets of paper, a gaming set (matching your chosen proficiency), a signet ring, a set of fine clothes, and a pouch containing 18 gp

      <text>Your unexpected good fortune is reflected by a minor boon. You gain the Lucky, Magic Initiate, or Skilled feat (your choice). Your choice of feat reflects the transformation that changed your life. An encounter with a genie who gave you three wishes might have resulted in magical powers represented by Magic Initiate. If you paid off all your family debts with a fortuitous round of three-dragon ante, you might be Lucky instead. Alternatively, you could use the Skilled feat to reflect whatever trial you endured to secure your new destiny and to model the knowledge and abilities imparted to you by whatever force transformed your life.</text>

      <name>Building a Rewarded Character</name>
      <text>Rewarded characters have varied histories, but they have one thing in common: they were down on their luck before their lives abruptly turned around. They might have given up all hope of a happier life, only to suddenly get a second chance. A rewarded character has often spent many years struggling to escape painful circumstances. Now, extricated from the (sometimes literal) prison that was their former life, they throw their cares to the wind and become adventurers.
	If your character's life was changed by a Deck of Many Things, consider which card was responsible. Perhaps the Fates card undid a tragic mistake your character made in their youth. The Gem card could have wiped out debts incurred over a lifetime. Maybe the Sage card provided the advice needed to escape a hopeless situation, the Star card increased an ability score to its current value, or a Wish spell cast after drawing the Moon card transformed your character from a peddler to a fledgling sorcerer infused with magic and new knowledge and skills. If you're making a character at higher than 1st level, magic items they have could have been granted by the Key or Sun card.</text>

      <text>The Fated Destinies table provides narrative ideas inspired by the Deck of Many Things that you can use as prompts while developing your character. The entries are geared toward characters who rely on faith, conviction, or fate—particularly clerics, druids, and paladins—but any character's story can benefit from them. When using this table, you can choose the entries that speak to you or randomly pull cards from The Deck of Many Things card set.
	The prompts can be personality traits, relationships, or events. Most are described as part of your character's past, but they might foretell events in your character's future. Consider how much your character knows about the destinies detailed in the table; these events might be a mystery to your character, shared only between you and your DM. Or perhaps your character learned about these events through omens or the readings of a fortune teller.

Fated Destinies:
Card | Heroic Tie
Balance | You were trained by an organization that opposes a deity or another powerful cosmic force.
Comet | You were born under a sign associated with cataclysm, and every attempt to glimpse your future reveals ill omens.
Donjon | A religious organization imprisoned you, perhaps because of a crime you committed against that faith or because the leaders considered you the servant of a rival power.
Euryale | You or your family are watched by secretive figures. They usually keep hidden, but you've seen they wear an unknown symbol.
Fates | You made a choice in your past that haunts you. Whatever the consequences, it's not clear you made the right choice.
Flames | A powerful figure opposed to your beliefs vexes your life; even your triumphs seem to serve this being's ends.
Fool | What could have been one of the happiest moments in your life turned into a tragedy.
Gem | You inherited land containing the ruins of a temple where a coveted relic was hidden.
Jester | You were brought up to believe in a prophecy of impending doom, but you perceive potential and hope where others expect disaster.
Key | An inflexible person with power over you threatened to bring about disaster, but your decisive action prevailed.
Knight | The defenders of a religious organization such as a druid circle, paladin order, or temple watch over you.
Moon | You are most comfortable at night, and all your greatest successes have taken place then. You also bear a silvery, crescent-shaped birthmark.
Puzzle | Your studies led you to a scrap of prophecy or the memoir of a prominent figure, which calls your beliefs into question.
Rogue | A devout individual whom you looked up to revealed themself to be false, a disciple of a power opposed to your beliefs.
Ruin | You were once a favored adherent of a religious order, but you've been cast out in disgrace.
Sage | An otherworldly being whispers advice to you in dreams or visitations, taking on different guises and speaking through others.
Skull | You were returned to life through resurrection magic, divine intervention, or a mysterious circumstance you don't yet understand.
Star | When you adopted your current beliefs, your life changed dramatically for the better.
Sun | While you never placed much stock in the beliefs you were taught, adhering to them saved you from a catastrophe.
Talons | You have a well-used holy symbol from someone you looked up to, and you feel uncertain anytime you're without it.
Throne | You were born to a family of divinely favored folk, and they have big expectations for you.
Void | Your soul, or a loved one's, is doomed to be taken by a Fiend, a powerful Undead, or another wicked power.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Everything was going so well! You had a life of luxury, love, and comfort when you suddenly lost it all. Perhaps you were framed for crimes you didn't commit and lost your reputation, fortune, and career. Maybe a rampaging dragon or another monster wiped out everything you had in a single calamitous afternoon. Or you might have sought out a Deck of Many Things, hoping to make your successful life even more glorious—only to draw a destructive card that changed your destiny forever.
	Your desperation has driven you to the career of adventurer. You don't seek out dark dungeons and their monstrous inhabitants for excitement and glory; you do it because every other path is closed to you. But you have risen high on fortune's wheel once before, and with luck and fortitude, you could do so again.

	• Skill Proficiencies: Stealth, Survival
	• Tool Proficiencies: One gaming set of your choice (such as playing cards or three-dragon ante cards)
	• Languages: One of your choice
	• Equipment: A cracked hourglass, a set of rusty manacles, a half-empty bottle, a hunting trap, a gaming set (matching your chosen proficiency), a set of traveler's clothes, and a pouch containing 13 gp

      <name>Feature: Still Standing</name>
      <text>You have weathered ruinous misfortune, and you possess hidden reserves others don't expect. You gain the Alert, Skilled, or Tough feat (your choice). Your choice of feat reflects how you've dealt with the terrible loss that changed your life forever. If you've kept your senses sharp for every opportunity and climbed your way out of misery by seizing the tiniest scrap of hope, choose Alert. If you've redoubled your efforts to reclaim what was once yours, choose Skilled. If you've stoically persevered through your misfortune, select Tough.</text>

      <name>Building a Ruined Character</name>
      <text>Ruined characters were on top of the world before misfortune struck. Many were wealthy. Others come from modest backgrounds, but they were surrounded by friends, family, and loved ones. They might have been famous, or simply never encountered serious hardship before. Some were born to privilege or rose to prominence through trickery or a false reputation. Now a Deck of Many Things—or another calamity—has knocked them down like a house of cards.
	If your character's life was ruined by a Deck of Many Things, consider which card was responsible. Perhaps your character was imprisoned for years by the Donjon or Void card, and now everyone they knew has died. Maybe your character drew the Rogue card, and the person closest to them—a spouse, child, or parent—turned against them. A devil unleashed by the Flames card might have destroyed their life. The Ruin or Talons card might have stolen the character's material goods or saddled them with vast debt.</text>
