    <text>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this hooked, obsidian dagger.

When you hit a creature with this magic weapon and roll a 19 or 20 on the attack roll, the creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw as the dagger flares with sickly light. The creature takes 6d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, the creature disintegrates into dust.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

    <text>These tinker's goggles have 3 charges. As an action, you can expend 1 charge to shoot a beam of fiery light from the goggles at a creature you can see within 120 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 fire damage. The goggles regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

Cursed: The goggles are cursed, and becoming attuned to them extends the curse to you. You can't remove the goggles or end your attunement to them until you are targeted by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic.
	Whenever you use the goggles' fiery beam and the target rolls a 20 on the d20 for the saving throw, the goggles expose you to a flash of violent bright light. As a result, you have the blinded condition for 24 hours.

If you're proficient with shields, you are proficient with attacks made using this shield. On a hit, it deals 1d6 slashing damage. If you throw the shield, it reappears in your hand the instant after it hits or misses a target.
	A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.

	The armor has 4 charges. You can use the charges in the following ways while wearing the armor:

Equalize: When you or a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself is about to roll a d20 with advantage or disadvantage, you can expend 1 charge and take a reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by advantage or disadvantage.

Expunge Imbalance: As a bonus action, you can expend 2 charges to cast the Lesser Restoration spell from the armor.

The armor regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.

This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer's vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.

Starlight Strike: As an action, you can spend any number of charges to launch bolts of frigid starlight. You launch a number of bolts equal to the number of charges spent, and you can direct the bolts to target one creature or several, so long as all creatures are within 120 feet of you and you can see them. The bolts automatically strike their targets, and each bolt deals 2d4 cold damage.

Whirling Hail: As an action, you can spend 3 charges and cast the Ice Storm spell (save DC 16).

Marked Card: As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge to draw a card from the deck and place it in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. The card then becomes marked with an invisible sigil. Once within the next 24 hours, as an action, you can speak the marked card's name and teleport to the card's location, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, appearing in the closest unoccupied space to the card. After you teleport in this way, or after 8 hours, the card returns to the deck, and the mark on it fades.

Riffling Portal: As an action, you can expend 3 charges to cast the Arcane Gate spell from the deck. The deck vanishes, and fluttering cards create the spell's portal rings. When the spell ends, the deck reappears in your possession.

Shuffling Stride: As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge to throw a card from the deck to an unoccupied space within 60 feet of yourself and teleport, along with any equipment you're wearing or carrying, to that space. The card then vanishes and returns to the deck.

    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>Over the centuries since the first Deck of Many Things was created, many have sought and failed to replicate it. But some have created new cards. These forty-four additional cards are known collectively as the Deck of Many More Things. (More information on creating new cards for this deck appears in chapter 2.)
	Like the Deck of Many Things, the Deck of Many More Things manifests differently on various worlds. While it can include fewer or different cards, it frequently appears with a Deck of Many Things as part of a combined deck of sixty-six illuminated cards. The combined deck is usually protected by a box or pouch. The forty-four cards of the Deck of Many More Things bear similar imagery to those in the Deck of Many Things and have potent magical effects, which are detailed later in this description. Notably, cards from the Deck of Many More Things are more likely to be beneficial, though about a third of them are still dangerous.
	Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly. Unless a card allows you to draw additional cards, any cards drawn exceeding this number have no effect.
	As soon as you draw a card, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card you declared no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. Unless a card states otherwise, if you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck and take effect simultaneously.
	Unless it is the Fool or the Jester card, a drawn card immediately takes effect, fades from existence, and reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card multiple times.
	The DM can use the physical cards provided in The Deck of Many Things card set to build a combined Deck of Many Things and Deck of Many More Things, including whichever cards they desire. Alternatively, roll on the Deck of Many More Things table below to randomly determine what cards are drawn.

* Found in the Deck of Many Things as depicted in the Dungeon Master's Guide.

Aberration: You gain telepathy within a range of 90 feet.

Beast: You immediately transform into a random Beast with a CR of 5 or lower. Your game statistics—including your ability scores, hit points, and possible actions—are replaced by the Beast's game statistics, and any nonmagical equipment you're wearing or carrying melds into your new form and can't be used. Any magic items you're carrying drop in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of your new form.
	You remain transformed in this way for 2d12 days; nothing can alter your form while you're under the effects of this card, but the Wish spell can end the transformation early. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the same state you were in when you initially transformed.

Book: You gain the ability to speak, read, and write 1d6 + 2 languages of your choice.

Bridge: You gain the ability to cast the Time Stop spell 1d3 times. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).

Campfire: You immediately gain the benefits of finishing a long rest.

Cavern: You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. You also gain the ability to move up, down, across vertical surfaces, and along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.

Celestial: You sprout a pair of softly luminescent, feathered wings from your back and gain a flying speed of 30 feet.

Construct: A homunculus appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. The appearance of the homunculus is determined by the DM, and the homunculus treats you as its creator.

Corpse: You immediately drop to 0 hit points, have the unconscious condition, and must begin making death saving throws. Spells and other magical effects that restore hit points have no effect on you until you are stabilized. If you fail three death saving throws, you die and can be resurrected only by the Wish spell.

Crossroads: Roll a d20. If the roll is even, you age 1d10 years. If the roll is odd, you become younger by 1d10 years, to a minimum of 1 year. This effect can be undone only by the Wish spell, divine intervention, or similar magic.

Door: You gain the ability to cast the Gate spell 1d4 times, requiring no material components. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).

Dragon: A dragon egg appears at your feet and immediately hatches into a dragon wyrmling. The type of dragon is chosen by the DM. The wyrmling views you as its parent and is staunchly loyal to you and your allies.

Elemental: You become immune to one of the following damage types (choose immediately upon drawing this card): acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.

Expert: Your Dexterity score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.

Fey: A fey crossing opens into the Feywild, and you're immediately pulled through it, disappearing in a flash of rainbow-colored light. You draw no more cards.
	The fey crossing appears as a shimmering fractal of light above the deck, and it remains open for 1 minute after the card is drawn. The precise location in the Feywild to which the fey crossing leads is determined by the DM.

Fiend: A powerful Fiend appears in a nearby unoccupied space and offers you a deal. The precise nature of this deal is up to the DM, but usually the Fiend offers some material reward in exchange for you and your allies completing a task for the Fiend. The Fiend is indifferent to you and can be bargained with; it keeps its side of any bargain it makes, though it might twist the wording of any agreement to suit its purposes. If attacked, or if negotiations fail and you refuse the Fiend's offer, it returns to its home plane.

Giant: You immediately grow 2d10 inches in height, and your hit point maximum and current hit points both increase by 20.

Humanoid: You can immediately choose to stop drawing from the deck, regardless of how many cards you initially declared.

Lance: All your ability scores increase by 1, to a maximum of 20.

Mage: Your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.

Map: At any time you choose within 1 year of drawing this card, you can mentally name or describe an object or individual that is familiar to you. You immediately know the location of the object or individual, as well as the distance between you and the object or individual, even if the object or individual is on a different plane of existence. If you named an individual, you know if they are alive and any conditions they have. If you named an object, you know if it is broken or not. If you named a magic item that has charges, you know how many charges it has remaining.

Maze: You gain 1d3 levels of exhaustion.

Mine: A pile of 2d6 gems (each worth 5,000 gp) and 1d10 chunks of precious ore (each worth 2,500 gp) appears at your feet.

Monstrosity: A Large or larger Monstrosity with a challenge rating of 10 or less (chosen by the DM) appears in an unoccupied space within 15 feet of you. The creature is hostile toward you and attacks immediately. The creature disappears when it is killed or when you are reduced to 0 hit points. If there isn't enough space for a Large or larger creature to appear, this card has no effect.

Ooze: A gelatinous cube immediately appears in your space and engulfs you. The gelatinous cube is hostile and remains until it is destroyed. If there isn't enough space for the gelatinous cube to appear, this card has no effect.

Path: Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.

Pit: A pit opens beneath you. You plummet 3d6 x 10 feet, take damage from the fall, and have the prone condition.

Plant: You gain the ability to cast Speak with Plants without using a spell slot; you must finish a long rest before you can cast it this way again. If you have spell slots of 3rd level or higher, you can cast this spell using them. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).

Priest: Your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.

Prisoner: Glowing chains made of magical force appear and wrap around you. You have the restrained condition until the chains are destroyed or you are freed. While you have this condition, you can't cast spells, and any magic items you're wearing or carrying have their properties suppressed. You draw no more cards. The chains are immune to damage and can't be dispelled using the Dispel Magic spell or similar magic. However, a Disintegrate spell destroys the chains instantly, freeing you. Another creature can also free you by succeeding on a DC 30 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.

Ring: A rare or rarer magic ring appears on your finger. If you have the attunement slots available, you're automatically attuned to the ring when it appears. The DM chooses the ring.

Shield: A rare or rarer suit of magic armor that you are proficient with appears in your hands. The DM chooses the armor. If you lack proficiency with any armor, your base AC instead now equals 12 + your Dexterity modifier while you aren't wearing armor.

Ship: You gain proficiency in three skills chosen by the DM.

Staff: A rare or rarer magic rod, staff, or wand appears in your hands. The DM chooses the item.

Stairway: You can choose to either decrease your number of declared draws by two or receive a rare or rarer wondrous item, which appears in your hands. The DM chooses the item.

Statue: You immediately have the petrified condition as your body is transformed into marble. The petrification lasts until you are freed with the Greater Restoration spell or similar magic.

Tavern: Your Charisma score increases by 2 to a maximum of 22.

Temple: A deity or entity of similar power becomes bound to aid you. At any point in time between drawing the card and when you die, you can use your action to call on this entity for divine intervention, and the entity is bound to answer. The parameters and nature of this intervention are chosen by the DM. If you die without having used this intervention, the deity fulfills its obligation by casting the Resurrection spell on you. Once the entity has answered your call for divine intervention or resurrected you, the entity is no longer bound to aid you.

Tomb: At any time you choose within 1 year of drawing this card, you can cast the True Resurrection spell once without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).

Tower: Draw two additional cards beyond your declared number of draws. The magic of these cards doesn't immediately take effect; instead, choose one of the two additional cards to keep, returning the other to the deck. The magic of the card you keep takes effect immediately thereafter.

Tree: Your skin immediately becomes rough, like tree bark. Your base AC now equals 15 + your Dexterity modifier while you aren't wearing armor, but you have vulnerability to fire damage. This transformation can be undone only by the Wish spell, divine intervention, or similar magic.

Undead: Somewhere on the Material Plane, a revenant rises. This revenant blames you for its existence and relentlessly hunts you to exact its revenge. The revenant exists until either 1 year passes, the revenant kills you, or you use a Wish spell to banish it permanently to the afterlife.

Warrior: Your Strength score increases by 2 to a maximum of 22.

Well: You learn three cantrips of your choice from any spell list.

The devil is initially unfriendly toward you and your companions. Roll initiative for the devil, which has its own turns. The DM has the creature's stat block. On each of your turns, you can issue a verbal command to the devil (no action required by you), and as long as you are holding this card, the devil obeys your commands. Otherwise, it is under the DM's control and acts according to its nature—it might attack you if it thinks it can prevail or try to tempt you to undertake an evil act in exchange for further service. After 1 minute or when the devil's hit points drop to 0, the devil returns to the Lower Planes. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

    <text>This deck of heavy vellum cards hums with the magic of the Elemental Chaos.
	The magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (a deck of real-world playing cards can simulate the deck). As an action, you can draw a random card from this deck and throw it to make a ranged spell attack, using Dexterity for the attack roll. The card has a range of 30 feet. On a hit, it deals 1d4 slashing damage and imposes a magical effect determined by its suit, as detailed in the Deck of Wild Cards table. The card immediately returns to the deck after it hits or misses a target.

Deck of Wild Cards:
d4 | Suit | Effect
1 | clubs (Rods) | The card explodes in a burst of fire. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d8 fire damage.
2 | diamonds (Coins) | The card shoots streaks of lightning. The target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the blinded condition until the end of your next turn, and each creature within 10 feet of the target takes 1d6 lightning damage.
3 | hearts (Cups) | The card covers the target in a thick layer of ice. The target takes 1d10 cold damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the restrained condition until the end of your next turn.
4 | spades (Swords) | The card unleashes a sharp, concussive blast. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it take 1d6 force damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or have the prone condition.

Blinded:
	• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.

    <text>Created in the image of the Deck of Many Things, this deck of ivory or vellum cards bestows an assortment of minor benefits and penalties on those who draw from it. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two.
	Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw, then draw them randomly. Any additional cards drawn have no effect. Unless a card states otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card you declared no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck and take effect simultaneously.
	Unless it is the Mystery card, a drawn card immediately takes effect, fades from existence, and reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card multiple times.
	You can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck, as shown in the Deck of Wonder table.

*Found only in a deck with twenty-two cards.

Beginning: Your hit point maximum and current hit points increase by 2d10. Your hit point maximum remains increased in this way for the next 8 hours.

Champion: You gain a +1 bonus to weapon attack and damage rolls. This bonus lasts for 8 hours.

Chancellor: Within 8 hours of drawing this card, you can cast Augury once as an action, requiring no material components. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).

Chaos: You gain resistance to one of the following damage types (chosen by the DM): acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. This resistance lasts for 1d12 days.

Coin: Five pieces of jewelry, each worth 100 gp, or ten gemstones, each worth 50 gp, appear at your feet.

Crown: You learn the Friends cantrip. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice). If you already know this cantrip, the card has no effect.

Dawn: This card invigorates you. For the next 8 hours, you can add your proficiency bonus to your initiative rolls.

Day: You gain a +1 bonus to saving throws. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest.

Destiny: This card protects you against an untimely demise. The first time after drawing this card that you would drop to 0 hit points from taking damage, you instead drop to 1 hit point.

Dusk: This card supernaturally saps your energy. You have disadvantage on initiative rolls. This effect lasts until you finish a long rest, but it can be ended early by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic.

End: This card is an omen of death. You take 2d10 necrotic damage, and your hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This effect can't reduce your hit point maximum below 10 hit points. This reduction lasts until you finish a long rest, but it can be ended early by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic.

Isolation: You disappear, along with anything you are wearing or carrying, and become trapped in a harmless extradimensional space for 1d4 minutes. You draw no more cards. You then reappear in the space you left or the nearest unoccupied space. When you reappear, you must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or have the poisoned condition for 1 hour as your body reels from the extradimensional travel.

Justice: You momentarily gain the ability to balance the scales of fate. For the next 8 hours, whenever you or a creature within 60 feet of you is about to roll a d20 with advantage or disadvantage, you can use your reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by advantage or disadvantage.

Knife: An uncommon magic weapon you're proficient with appears in your hands. The DM chooses the weapon.

Lock: You gain the ability to cast Knock 1d3 times. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).

Mischief: You receive an uncommon wondrous item (chosen by the DM), or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.

Monster: This card's monstrous visage curses you. While cursed in this way, whenever you make a saving throw, you must roll 1d4 and subtract the number rolled from the total. The curse lasts until you finish a long rest, but it can be ended early with a Remove Curse spell or similar magic.

Mystery: You have disadvantage on Intelligence saving throws for 1 hour. Discard this card and draw from the deck again; together, the two draws count as one of your declared draws.

Night: You gain darkvision within a range of 300 feet. This darkvision lasts for 8 hours.

Order: You gain resistance to one of the following damage types (chosen by the DM): force, necrotic, poison, psychic, or radiant. This resistance lasts for 1d12 days.

Student: You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).

Vulture: One nonmagical item or piece of equipment in your possession (chosen by the DM) disappears. The item remains nearby but concealed for a short time, so it can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. If the item isn't recovered within 1 hour, it disappears forever.

    <text>This marble-size crystal sphere glows with extraplanar energy.
	As part of attuning to this item, you press the crystal sphere to the hilt of a nonmagical melee weapon of your choice, magically attaching the sphere to the weapon. The weapon becomes a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls. While wielding this weapon, you gain the following benefits:

Dimensional Anchor: You have advantage on saving throws against spells or effects that would send you to an extradimensional space, a demiplane, or another plane of existence against your will.

Isolating Smite: When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force the creature to make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is banished to a harmless demiplane until the end of its next turn. When the banished creature returns, it reappears in the space it left or the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

When you end your attunement to the sphere, the sphere harmlessly detaches from the weapon, and the weapon reverts to a nonmagical piece of equipment.

	While wielding this shield, you gain the following benefits:

Blessing of Euryale: You have resistance to poison damage and are immune to the petrified condition.

Petrifying Heraldry: As a bonus action, you can make the front of the shield flare with a medusa's petrifying magic, causing the relief's eyes to glow brightly. Choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, or it has the restrained condition as its body turns to stone. The restrained creature must make another DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the start of its next turn. On a failed save, the creature has the petrified condition for 24 hours. On a successful save, the restrained condition ends. Once this bonus action is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Spellcasting: While wielding the shield, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: Lesser Restoration, Locate Creature, Transport via Plants. Once you use the shield to cast a spell, the shield can't cast that spell again until the next dawn.

The pile must appear on a surface that can support it. After 1 hour, the coins vanish, regardless of where they are. Once this action is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Illusory Fashion: As a bonus action, you can magically change the appearance of your clothing and armor. You can change the style, color, and apparent quality of what you're wearing, or you can make it appear as if you were wearing different garments entirely. In either case, the changes wrought by this magic fail to pass physical inspection.

    <text>The blades of these pruning shears bear many nicks and dents but still cut cleanly. The shears function as a magic dagger. The weapon has the following properties:

Ever Sharp: When you hit with an attack using the shears, the target takes an extra 1d6 force damage.

Sever Threads: When you hit a creature with the shears, you can cut that creature's fate. Until the target finishes a long rest, attack rolls against it score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Light. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Proficiency: simple, dagger

    <text>This magic hammer has 3 charges. As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge and slam this hammer on the ground, creating a 15-foot-radius circle of glowing runes centered on the point of impact. While you're inside that area, your hammer glows with matching runes, and you gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this hammer. The rune circle disappears after 1 minute, when you create another rune circle, or when you dismiss the rune circle as a bonus action. This hammer regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>This deck of cards is decorated with geometric shapes that have a protective motif. While you're holding the deck, you can use an action to shuffle it and cause the cards to deal themselves out and transform into a shelter made of cards. The shelter can be shaped however you desire, but it must fit in a 40-foot cube centered on a point within 30 feet of you. The shelter has one door and up to four windows, and only you can open or close them. It has a floor and a roof, and it maintains a comfortable temperature inside.
	The shelter has AC 15, 50 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The shelter lasts for 24 hours, until you dismiss it as an action, or until it is reduced to 0 hit points. When the shelter's duration ends, it transforms back into a deck of cards and appears in your hand. Once the deck has transformed into a shelter, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

    <text>This gleaming set of silver-and-gold plate armor never tarnishes.
	While wearing this armor, you can use a bonus action to summon the spirit of a warrior to your aid. The spirit's corporeal form manifests in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of you, and it uses the knight stat block. The spirit disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or after 1 minute, whichever comes first.
	The spirit is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count but takes its turn immediately after yours. The spirit obeys your commands (no action required by you); if you don't issue any commands, the spirit takes the Dodge action and uses its movement to avoid danger.
	Once this bonus action is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.

The wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

If the wearer has a Strength score lower than 15, their speed is reduced by 10 feet.

    <text>Ammo: sling bullet

When you hit a Giant creature with a ranged attack roll using this magic sling, the creature must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or have the prone condition.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons"). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Battle Foreknowledge: When you roll initiative, you can expend 1 charge to add or subtract your proficiency bonus from the total roll.

Doom Foretold: As an action, you can expend 2 charges to target a creature within 30 feet of yourself and invoke that creature's doom. While the target is on the same plane of existence as you, you can sense the direction to its location, and you know the direction of its movement if it's in motion. Additionally, once per turn when you deal damage to the doomed creature, you can roll 1d6 and add the number rolled to the damage roll. These benefits persist for 1 hour or until you target another creature with this effect.

Twist of Fate: When a creature within 60 feet of you makes a saving throw or an attack roll, you can use your reaction to expend 3 charges and alter the outcome, turning a failed saving throw into a successful one, a missed attack roll into a hit, or vice versa.

The wand regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.

On a failed save, the creature has the petrified condition for 8 hours. When the war pick has no charges remaining, it loses this property.

While holding the staff, you can reroll a number of damage dice up to your proficiency bonus when you use a spell slot to cast a spell that deals fire or radiant damage. You must use the new rolls.

Sunny Glow: As a bonus action, you can cause the staff to glow with sunlight. While glowing, the staff sheds bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. The light lasts until you use another bonus action to extinguish it.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

	After spending 1 hour calibrating the telescope, you can attempt to travel to the planet or celestial body at which the telescope is currently pointed.

On a successful check, you and eight other willing creatures touching the telescope, along with everything all travelers are wearing and carrying, safely teleport to unoccupied spaces at the intended destination. On a failed check, a mishap occurs instead. The DM rolls on the Telescope Travel Mishaps table to determine the mishap or chooses a mishap that's good for the campaign.

Telescope Travel Mishaps:

1 | The travelers appear adrift in the Astral Sea.
2 | The travelers appear on a different plane of existence, determined randomly or chosen by the DM.
3 | Excess cosmic energy overloads the telescope, causing it to explode. Each creature within 60 feet of the telescope takes 8d6 necrotic damage. Any Humanoid who survives this damage is transformed into a different kind of creature, as if it had been subject to the Reincarnate spell.
4 | A creature from the Astral Sea (such as a githyanki knight) appears within 60 feet of the telescope. The DM decides its attitude.
5 | The travelers appear on a different planet or celestial body in the Wildspace system nearest to their target destination.
6 | The travelers arrive at their intended destination, but they each appear coated in harmless slime.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

The projection disappears at the end of your turn. Once you use this bonus action, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Curse: This armor is cursed, and attuning to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you're unwilling to part with the armor. Taking it off fails to end the curse. While cursed in this way, you feel disconnected from your body, continuously hearing whispers that call for you to join them. Whenever you finish a long rest while cursed, you must make a DC 11 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, your soul is drawn from your body and trapped in an object on a different plane of existence. The object and location of this object are chosen by the DM (but might be the House of Cards; see chapter 18). While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is inert and doesn't age or require sustenance. Destroying the object frees your soul; otherwise, only a Wish spell can restore your soul to your body.

Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.

    <text>This silver skeleton key is warm to the touch. While holding the key in its key form, you can use an action to cast the Knock spell from the key.

Transforming the Key: While holding the key, you can use a bonus action to transform it into a magic longsword. You are considered proficient with the sword, and you have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. On a hit, the sword deals 1d10 force damage. The item remains in its sword form until it leaves your grasp or you use another bonus action to revert it to its key form.
	If you end your attunement to the item while it's in its sword form, it automatically reverts to its key form.
