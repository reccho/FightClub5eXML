      <text>"Let me know when you're all done talking."
— Tordek

Of all the adventurers in the worlds of D&amp;D, the fighter is perhaps the greatest paradox. On the one hand, a singular feature of the class is that no two fighters ply their craft in quite the same way; their weapons, armor, and tactics differ across a vast spectrum. On the other hand, regardless of the tools and methods one uses, at the heart of every fighter's motivation lies the same basic truth: it is better to wound than to be wounded.
	Although some adventuring fighters risk their lives fighting for glory or treasure, others are primarily concerned with the welfare of others. They put more value on the well-being of the society, the village, or the group than on their own safety. Even if there's gold in the offing, the true reward for most fighters comes from sending enemies to their doom.
	The sections below offer ways to add a little depth and a few personal touches to your fighter character.

      <name>Heraldic Sign</name>
      <text>Fighters typically do battle for a cause. Some fight on behalf of kingdoms besieged by monsters, while others quest only for personal glory. In either case, a fighter often displays a heraldic sign that represents that cause, either adopting the symbol of a nation or a royal line, or creating a crest to represent one's self-interest.
	Your character could be affiliated with an organization or a cause, and thus might already travel under a banner of some sort. If that's not the case, consider devising a heraldic sign that symbolizes an aspect of your nature or speaks to what you see as your purpose in the world.

Heraldic Signs:
d6 | Heraldic Signs
1 | A rampant golden dragon on a green field, representing valor and a quest for wealth
2 | The fist of a storm giant clutching lightning before a storm cloud, symbolizing wrath and power
3 | Crossed greatswords in front of a castle gate, signifying the defense of a city or kingdom
4 | A skull with a dagger through it, representing the doom you bring to your enemies
5 | A phoenix in a ring of fire, an expression of an indomitable spirit
6 | Three drops of blood beneath a horizontal sword blade on a black background, symbolizing three foes you have sworn to kill</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Instructor</name>
      <text>Some fighters are natural-born combatants who have a talent for surviving in battle. Others learned the basics of their combat prowess in their formative years from spending time in a military or some other martial organization, when they were taught by the leaders of the group.
	A third type of fighter comes from the ranks of those who received one-on-one instruction from an accomplished veteran of the craft. That instructor was, or perhaps still is, well versed in a certain aspect of combat that relates to the student's background.
	If you decide that your character had an individual instructor, what is that person's specialty? Do you emulate your instructor in how you fight, or did you take the instructor's teachings and adapt them to your own purposes?

Instructor:
d6 | Instructor
1 | Gladiator. Your instructor was a slave who fought for freedom in the arena, or one who willingly chose the gladiator's life to earn money and fame.
2 | Military. Your trainer served with a group of soldiers and knows much about working as a team.
3 | City Watch. Crowd control and peacekeeping are your instructor's specialties.
4 | Tribal Warrior. Your instructor grew up in a tribe, where fighting for one's life was practically an everyday occurrence.
5 | Street Fighter. Your trainer excels at urban combat, combining close-quarters work with silence and efficiency.
6 | Weapon Master. Your mentor helped you to become one with your chosen weapon, by imparting highly specialized knowledge of how to wield it most effectively.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Style</name>
      <text>Many fighters distinguish themselves from their peers by adopting and perfecting a particular style or method of waging combat. Although this style might be a natural outgrowth of a fighter's personality, that's not always the case—someone's approach to the world in general does not necessarily dictate how that person operates when lives are on the line.
	Do you have a combat style that mirrors your outlook on life, or is something else inside you unleashed when weapons are drawn?

Style:
d6 | Style
1 | Elegant. You move with precise grace and total control, never using more energy than you need.
2 | Brutal. Your attacks rain down like hammer blows, meant to splinter bone or send blood flying.
3 | Cunning. You dart in to attack at just the right moment and use small-scale tactics to tilt the odds in your favor.
4 | Effortless. You rarely perspire or display anything other than a stoic expression in battle.
5 | Energetic. You sing and laugh during combat as your spirit soars. You are happiest when you have a foe in front of you and a weapon in hand.
6 | Sinister. You scowl and sneer while fighting, and you enjoy mocking your foes as you defeat them.</text>

    <!-- Martial Archetype: Arcane Archer -->

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Martial Archetype: Arcane Archer</name>
        <text>An Arcane Archer studies a unique elven method of archery that weaves magic into attacks to produce supernatural effects. Arcane Archers are some of the most elite warriors among the elves. They stand watch over the fringes of elven domains, keeping a keen eye out for trespassers and using magic-infused arrows to defeat monsters and invaders before they can reach elven settlements. Over the centuries, the methods of these elf archers have been learned by members of other races who can also balance arcane aptitude with archery.

        <text>At 3rd level, you learn magical theory or some of the secrets of nature—typical for practitioners of this elven martial tradition. You choose to gain proficiency in either the Arcana or the Nature skill, and you choose to learn either the prestidigitation or the druidcraft cantrip.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Arcane Shot (Arcane Archer)</name>
        <text>At 3rd level, you learn to unleash special magical effects with some of your shots. When you gain this feature, you learn two Arcane Shot options of your choice (see the "Fighter (Arcane Archer): Arcane Shot" spell list).
	Once per turn when you fire an arrow from a shortbow or longbow as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Arcane Shot options to that arrow. You decide to use the option when the arrow hits a creature, unless the option doesn't involve an attack roll. You have two uses of this ability, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.
	You gain an additional Arcane Shot option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each option also improves when you become an 18th-level fighter.

If an option requires a saving throw, your Arcane Shot save DC is calculated as follows:

	Arcane Shot save DC = 8 + Intelligence modifier + Proficiency Bonus

        <name>Martial Archetype: Cavalier</name>
        <text>The archetypal Cavalier excels at mounted combat. Usually born among the nobility and raised at court, a Cavalier is equally at home leading a cavalry charge or exchanging repartee at a state dinner. Cavaliers also learn how to guard those in their charge from harm, often serving as the protectors of their superiors and of the weak. Compelled to right wrongs or earn prestige, many of these fighters leave their lives of comfort to embark on glorious adventure.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Born to the Saddle (Cavalier)</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, your mastery as a rider becomes apparent. You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off your mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if you're not incapacitated.
	Finally, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Unwavering Mark (Cavalier)</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, you can menace your foes, foiling their attacks and punishing them for harming others. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can mark the creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or you die, or if someone else marks the creature.
	While it is within 5 feet of you, a creature marked by you has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't target you.
	In addition, if a creature marked by you deals damage to anyone other than you, you can make a special melee weapon attack against the marked creature as a bonus action on your next turn. You have advantage on the attack roll, and if it hits, the attack's weapon deals extra damage to the target equal to half your fighter level.
	Regardless of the number of creatures you mark, you can make this special attack a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

        <name>Warding Maneuver (Cavalier)</name>
        <text>At 7th level, you learn to fend off strikes directed at you, your mount, or other creatures nearby. If you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can roll 1d8 as a reaction if you're wielding a melee weapon or a shield. Roll the die, and add the number rolled to the target's AC against that attack. If the attack still hits, the target has resistance against the attack's damage.
	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

        <text>At 10th level, you become a master of locking down your enemies. Creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they move 5 feet or more while within your reach, and if you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, the target's speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the current turn.

If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line right before attacking a creature and you hit it with the attack, that target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.

        <text>Starting at 18th level, you respond to danger with extraordinary vigilance. In combat, you get a special reaction that you can take once on every creature's turn, except your turn. You can use this special reaction only to make an opportunity attack, and you can't use it on the same turn that you take your normal reaction.
