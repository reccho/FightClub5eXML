  <description>A Manual of Mammoth Marvels!

Bigby the Great recounts his journeys into the history, myth, and society of giants in this guide to their realms in the worlds of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Here Bigby and the demigod Diancastra, child of the giants' All-Father, Annam, unveil the secrets of Annam's mighty descendants.

Players will find a wealth of giant-themed character options: a subclass for barbarians, two backgrounds related to giants and their runic magic, and feat options that evoke the strength and primal magic of the giants. Dungeon Masters will gain inspiration for bringing giants to life, from maps of giant-built sites to tremendous treasures and intriguing trinkets in a giant's bagâ€”as well as dozens of big new monsters!

Let Bigby teach you everything about the iconic giants of D&amp;D!</description>
