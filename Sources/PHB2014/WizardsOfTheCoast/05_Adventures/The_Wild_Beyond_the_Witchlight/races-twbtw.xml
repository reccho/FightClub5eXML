      <text>The Feywild is home to many fantastic peoples, including fairies. Fairies are a wee folk, but not nearly as much so as their pixie and sprite friends. The first fairies spoke Elvish, Goblin, or Sylvan, and encounters with human visitors prompted many of them to learn Common as well.

      <name>Fey Characteristics</name>
      <text>Infused with the magic of the Feywild, fairies share a few commonalities with one another but can differ widely in appearance, behavior, and attitude. Many fairies have a special physical characteristic that sets them apart from other creatures of their kind. For your fairy, roll on the Fey Characteristic table or choose an option from it. The Feywild is a wild place, so come up with your own characteristic if none of these fit your character.

Fey Characteristics:
d8 | Characteristic
1 | Your wings are like those of a bird.
2 | You have shimmering, multicolored skin.
3 | You have exceptionally large ears.
4 | A glittering mist constantly surrounds you.
5 | You have a small spectral horn on your forehead, like a little unicorn horn.
6 | Your legs are insectile.
7 | You smell like fresh brownies.
8 | A noticeable, harmless chill surrounds you</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Harengons originated in the Feywild, where they spoke Sylvan and embodied the spirit of freedom and travel. In time, these rabbitfolk hopped into other worlds, bringing the fey realm's exuberance with them and learning new languages as they went.
	Harengons are bipedal, with the characteristic long feet of the rabbits they resemble and fur in a variety of colors. They share the keen senses and powerful legs of leporine creatures and are full of energy, like a wound-up spring. Harengons are blessed with a little fey luck, and they often find themselves a few fortunate feet away from dangers during adventures.
