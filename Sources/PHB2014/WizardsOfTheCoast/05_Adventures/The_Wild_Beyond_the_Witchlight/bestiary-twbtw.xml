On a failed saving throw, the creature can't take reactions until the start of its next turn, and it rolls a d4 to determine what it does during its current turn:

1-2. The creature does nothing.
3. The creature does nothing except use all its movement to move in a random direction.
4. The creature either makes one melee attack against a random creature it can see or does nothing if no visible creature is within its reach.</text>

    <description>A redcap is a homicidal fey creature born of blood lust. Although small, redcaps have formidable strength.

In the Feywild, or in places where that plane touches another plane at a fey crossing, one or more redcaps might appear where fresh blood soaks the ground. At first, new redcaps look like tiny, bloodstained mushrooms just pushing their caps out of the soil. When moonlight shines on one of these caps, a creature that looks like a wizened and undersized gnome with a hunched back and a sinewy frame springs from the earth. The creature has a pointed leather cap, pants of similar material, heavy iron boots, and a heavy bladed weapon. From the moment it awakens, a redcap desires only murder and carnage, and it sets out to satisfy these cravings. Even if a redcap wanted to be stealthy, its iron boots force it to take ponderous, thunderous steps.

To sustain its unnatural existence, a redcap must soak its hat in the fresh blood of its victims. If the blood isn't replenished at least once every three days, the redcap vanishes as if it had never been. A redcap's desire to slay is rooted in its will to survive.

      <text>A 20-foot radius of spores extends from the swarm. These spores can go around corners, and they have no effect on Constructs, Elementals, Plants, or Undead. Each other creature in the area must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is incapacitated and its speed is halved, both for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>

      <text>Zargash casts one of the following spells, using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 13):

	• At will: light, thaumaturgy
	• 1/Day each: command, gaseous form, hold person, silence, speak with dead</text>

      <text>Zargash targets the lifeless corpse of one Humanoid he can see within 30 feet of him and commands it to rise, transforming it into a zombie under his control. The zombie takes its turn immediately after Zargash. Animating the zombie requires Zargash's concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). The zombie reverts to an inanimate corpse after 10 minutes, when it drops to 0 hit points, or when Zargash's concentration ends.</text>
