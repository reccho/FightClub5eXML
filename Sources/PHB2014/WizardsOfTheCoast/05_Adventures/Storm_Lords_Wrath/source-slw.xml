  <description>Defend the Settlement of Leilon in the 1st adventure of the three-part follow-up to Dragon of Icespire Peak for the World's Greatest Roleplaying Game.

Abandoned for many years, Leilon was once a fortified settlement midway along the High Road from Waterdeep to Neverwinter.

Under the paid service of the Lord Protector Dagult Neverember, citizens of Neverwinter have returned, intent on reestablishing Leilon as a safe waypoint once more.

Unfortunately, followers of Talos have also arrived, and they've brought the weather with them.</description>
