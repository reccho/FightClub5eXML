    <text>A yklwa (pronounced YICK-ul-wah) is a simple melee weapon that is the traditional weapon of Chultan warriors. A yklwa consists of a 3-foot wooden shaft with a steel or stone blade up to 18 inches long. Although it has the thrown weapon property, the yklwa is not well balanced for throwing.

This magic weapon has a dull, rusty color or has veins of ruidium running through it. While this weapon is on your person, you gain the following benefits:

	• You can breathe water.
	• You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

Ruidium Strike: A creature you hit with this weapon takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage.

Ruidium Corruption: When you roll a 1 on an attack roll made with this weapon, you must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you gain 1 level of exhaustion. If you are not already suffering from ruidium corruption, you become corrupted when you fail this save.

If Ruidium Is Destroyed: If the Apotheon is killed or redeemed, all the ruidium in Exandria is destroyed instantly, and a ruidium weapon becomes a +2 weapon.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Proficiency: simple, Yklwa
