  <description>The ghosts of the Swords of Leilon have returned to bring warning so you might protect their beloved town and prevent two great evils, both competing for the same prize, from wiping it from the Sword Coast once more.

You must enter the Ethereal Plane, prevent the followers of Talos and Myrkul from gaining possession of an artifact of great evil, and putdown the forces of not one, but two vile deities.</description>
