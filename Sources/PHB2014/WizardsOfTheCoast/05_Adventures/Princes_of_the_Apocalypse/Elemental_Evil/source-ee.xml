  <description>In the adventure Princes of the Apocalypse, the cosmic threat of Elemental Evil reaches the Forgotten Realms. This supplement provides new options for player characters in that epic campaign.

Create Heroic Characters to Conquer the Elements!

Not inherently evil, elemental power can be mastered by those with both malevolent and benign intentions. The Elemental Evil Player's Companion provides everything players need to build a character that is tied directly into the Elemental Evil storyline.

New race options include the aarakocra, deep gnome, genasi, and goliath. Additionally, a plethora of new spells put the elements directly at your command.
