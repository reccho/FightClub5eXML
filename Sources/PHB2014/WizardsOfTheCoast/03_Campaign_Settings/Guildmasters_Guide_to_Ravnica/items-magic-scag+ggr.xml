    <text>Spiked armor is a rare type of medium armor made by dwarves. It consists of a leather coat and leggings covered with spikes that are usually made of metal.

This suit of armor is reinforced with a magically enhanced metal alloy called mizzium, which is made in Izzet foundries. While you're wearing the armor, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit. In addition, when you are subjected to a magical effect that allows you to make a Strength or Constitution saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw.

The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (Dexterity) checks.

Barding is armor designed to protect an animal's head, neck, chest, and body.

Spiked barding provides a mount with an AC equal to 14 + the mount's Dexterity modifier (max 2). The mount makes Dexterity (Stealth) checks with disadvantage.
