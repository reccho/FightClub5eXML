    <text>Spiked armor is a rare type of medium armor made by dwarves. It consists of a leather coat and leggings covered with spikes that are usually made of metal.

This magic armor has a dull, rusty color or has veins of ruidium running through it. While you wear this armor, you gain the following benefits:

	• You have resistance to psychic damage.
	• You can breathe water.
	• You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

Ruidium Corruption: When you roll a 1 on a saving throw while wearing this armor, you must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you gain 1 level of exhaustion. If you are not already suffering from ruidium corruption, you become corrupted when you fail this save.

If Ruidium Is Destroyed: If the Apotheon is killed or redeemed, all the ruidium in Exandria is destroyed instantly, and ruidium armor becomes +1 armor.

The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (Dexterity) checks.

Barding is armor designed to protect an animal's head, neck, chest, and body.

Spiked barding provides a mount with an AC equal to 14 + the mount's Dexterity modifier (max 2). The mount makes Dexterity (Stealth) checks with disadvantage.
