    <description>The Alyxian Aboleth is a unique creature that believes it carries the soul of the Apotheon within its body, trapped in this aberrant form as divine punishment for his failure to save the world during the Calamity. Veins of ruidium crisscross the aboleth's body, and a secondary face has emerged from its pale green hide. The second face is a mutation that has no effect on the creature's game statistics.

    <description>Emotional State:
Alyxian the Callous is cold and distant, disregarding words he doesn't care to hear. He sees himself as a perfect, "holy" being and believes that the world should be condemned for its crimes against him.
	The following bits of dialogue are examples of what he might say in this emotional state:

	• "What crime have I committed other than craving freedom? Why do you not condemn those who left me to rot?"
	• "It is as I thought: you are imperfect judges. You have not known my suffering. No one can know it;
I am my only judge."
	• "I have lived a thousand lifetimes and felt a million sorrows. I am the judge this world deserves- and mine will be the final decree."

    <description>Emotional State:
Alyxian the Dispossessed is tired. The weariness that has built up in him over the centuries has begun to overcome his anger and bitterness. Now he needs to be guided back into the light.
	The following bits of dialogue are examples of what he might say in this emotional state:

	• "This world has moved beyond me. There is no place in it for a bitter man such as I."
	• "How could the gods ever forgive me for what I have done? I'm too old for redemption."
	• "Your naivete shows itself. The omens of Ruidus haunt me now as they did many moons ago."

    <description>Ayojabe is a water genasi and a natural-born leader who was born to ore parents during a fierce storm at sea.

As the de facto leader of a new, unnamed adventuring party, Ayo Jabe has a lot of responsibility on her shoulders. She and her companions have worked odd jobs around the town of Jigow for a few weeks now, and she's starting to feel confident that they're ready for real adventure.
	Ayo is a water genasi who was born to orc parents during a terrible storm in the Emerald Gulch. Her family has lived in Jigow for generations, and she's eager to leave home and see the world.
	Ayo picked up her combat skills while working as a hunter for the town of Jigow. She recently joined up with her childhood friend Dermot, as well as Maggie Keeneyes, a mercenary who came to town several weeks ago. Despite Maggie's brusque demeanor, she became a loyal friend of Ayo and Dermot, and the three of them have become inseparable, even as more adventurers have joined their party.
	Ayo is hotheaded and appreciates people who make decisions as impulsively as she does. Nevertheless, she respects Dermot's even-tempered advice and dutifully plays the role of the wise leader. She has no patience for people who are indecisive, and she is infuriated by people who don't say what they really mean.

    <description>Ayojabe is a water genasi and a natural-born leader who was born to ore parents during a fierce storm at sea.

As the de facto leader of a new, unnamed adventuring party, Ayo Jabe has a lot of responsibility on her shoulders. She and her companions have worked odd jobs around the town of Jigow for a few weeks now, and she's starting to feel confident that they're ready for real adventure.
	Ayo is a water genasi who was born to orc parents during a terrible storm in the Emerald Gulch. Her family has lived in Jigow for generations, and she's eager to leave home and see the world.
	Ayo picked up her combat skills while working as a hunter for the town of Jigow. She recently joined up with her childhood friend Dermot, as well as Maggie Keeneyes, a mercenary who came to town several weeks ago. Despite Maggie's brusque demeanor, she became a loyal friend of Ayo and Dermot, and the three of them have become inseparable, even as more adventurers have joined their party.
	Ayo is hotheaded and appreciates people who make decisions as impulsively as she does. Nevertheless, she respects Dermot's even-tempered advice and dutifully plays the role of the wise leader. She has no patience for people who are indecisive, and she is infuriated by people who don't say what they really mean.

    <description>Priests bring the teachings of their gods to the common folk. They are the spiritual leaders of temples and shrines and often hold positions of influence in their communities. Evil priests might work openly under a tyrant, or they might be the leaders of religious sects hidden in the shadows of good society, overseeing depraved rites. A priest typically has one or more acolytes to help with religious ceremonies and other sacred duties.

    <description>A weird and deadly offshoot of the moorbounder has rows of long, bladelike bristles covering its sleek body. The creature uses these blades to slash nearby creatures to ribbons. However, these blades make the bristled moorbounder less suitable as a mount.

Moorbounders:
Predators that stalk the marshlands and muddy foothills of Xhorhas, moorbounders are regarded as dangerous killers by those who try to avoid them on their travels- and as prized mounts by those willing to capture and train them. Though the process of domesticating a moorbounder is fraught with peril, these creatures can become favored hunting companions and powerful war mounts.
	Moorbounders hunt with elongated tusks and retractable claws. With a vague resemblance to large hunting cats, their muscular bodies are built for combat, granting them incredible prowess at leaping and a running speed that makes them dominant carnivores.

    <description>Drifting through the dark waters of the Netherdeep, the death embrace is an ominous sight. Beneath its bell hangs a lacy, tendrilous mass that thrums with magic, surrounded by six 60-foot-long, barbed tentacles. The death embrace uses these tentacles to grasp and petrify its prey.
	Despite its foreboding name, the death embrace is not an overly aggressive creature. It prefers to bide its time, using creatures it has caught in its tentacles as shields to absorb attacks.

    <description>Dermot Wurder is a goblin priest who worships the Luxon, a divine entity of light and rebirth.

When you're the twelfth son of a poor goblin family in Jigow, the only way to make a name for yourself is to become a great champion—someone who can win bragging contests in the local taverns night after night. Young Dermot Wurder, however, wasn't interested in performing feats of strength or agility that would win him a boast-worthy epithet. Fame wasn't for him, nor was the aggressiveness that becoming famous required. He was more interested in cooking, planting flowers, and sewing clothes- doing the work that kept his family together while his carefree siblings dove off waterfalls and wrestled stray dogs.
	Dermot and Ayo Jabe have known each other long enough that their first meeting has vanished into the haze of youthful pre-memory. Dermot accompanied Ayo whenever he could, packing herbs and medicines when they went exploring in the woods. When Ayo recently told him of her dream to form an adventuring party, he started training to wear heavy armor and threw himself into studying the faith of the Luxon so he could wield the blessings of the light to protect those he cares about.
	Dermot is fiercely protective of his friends and furiously rebukes anyone who disparages or threatens them. His deepest need-one even he doesn't know he has-is to make a friend who will help him realize what he wants for himself.

    <description>Galeokaerda has long posed as a professor of the Allegiance of Allsight and has become Insight's friend.
	Unknown to Professor Acuere, Galeokaerda is the Consortium spy.

Occultists of the Vermilion Dream:
The Consortium of the Vermilion Dream is viewed as an esoteric, profit-driven, but ultimately harmless cabal of ghost hunters and perpetuators of urban legends. This perception isn't inaccurate, but the consortium's leadership is obsessed with one set of legends in particular: those involving the Moon of Ill Omen, Ruidus, and the ancient figures cursed by exposure to its alien influence.
	The cruelest desires and predilections of the consortium's most obsessive agents have been enhanced by contact with ruidium-tainted items.

Occult Extollant:
Occult extollants delve deep into ancient legends and seek to solve mysteries that have led other investigators to their doom, driven by an unquenchable yearning to know the unknown.

    <description>Ayojabe is a water genasi and a natural-born leader who was born to ore parents during a fierce storm at sea.

Beautiful, ethereal, deathly, shadowy—all accurately describe Galsariad Ardyth, a drow in his two-hundredth year of life. He's recently taken up the study of arcane magic, and he's pursuing the life of an adventurer in hopes of improving his reputation within the Kryn Dynasty. Loquacious, snarky, and sarcastic to a fault, he's ready with a barb for any occasion—usually to mask his own insecurities.
	A city-dweller from the Kryn capital of Rosohna, Galsariad is blessed with sharp aesthetic sensibilities and an interest in ancient lore, especially history concerning the Age of Arcanum, Exandria's long-lost magical golden age. He's also the newest member of the rival party, and both Ayo and Irvan are impressed by his ethereal elegance—and have a bit of a crush on him, even if he does talk too much.
	Galsariad appreciates people who share his interests and are willing to spend time studying with him, though he also likes it when people treat him with respect even if they don't care about magic. He dislikes people who keep secrets from him, and hates when people judge him for being a novice at magic even though he's centuries old.

    <description>A gloomstalker is a winged predator resembling a wyvern composed of twisting shadows, with glowing eyes and dagger-like teeth.
	Hailing from the cursed lands of the Shadowfell, these nightmarish creatures hunt the barrens of that desolate plane, freezing prey in their tracks with their woeful shrieks before pulling them into the sky with their talons to be ripped apart and devoured.
	A gloomstalker's proclivity for darkness makes it extremely dangerous at night or in heavily shaded places where it can blend in with the shadowed surroundings. Much more dangerous than the lone hunter is a pack of gloomstalkers. Small packs of three to six are common. Larger packs of ten or more, called frenzies, are often harbingers of a greater evil yet to be seen.
	Gloomstalkers were employed by arcanists and the followers of the Betrayer Gods as mounts in the ancient battles of the Calamity. A respectable number of gloomstalkers, now free of their burden, still occupy hidden lairs scattered across the wastes of Xhorhas.

    <description>Desolate badlands and soggy marshes are home to the ancient and massive horizonback tortoises of Xhorhas. Nearly fifty feet long from nose to tail, and with a habit of remaining stationary for extended periods, a horizonback tortoise is easy to mistake for a low hill at a distance. But when these impressive creatures rise to begin their march, the sight inspires fear and awe in equal parts. Omnivores of incredible size, these scavengers prefer to feed on dead vegetation but devour whatever edible matter they come across.
	Referred to as "kinespaji" by the goblins of the east, these majestic and slow-moving beasts have long enjoyed a symbiotic relationship with the denizens of Xhorhas. Horizon back tortoises provide mobile homesteads and can act as siege weapons in times of crisis.

Scholars of Allsight:
The Allegiance of Allsight is a scholarly faction that operates primarily within the Marquesian metropolis of Ank'Harel.

Scholarly Mastermind:
Scholarly masterminds are the formidable leaders of academic research organizations, responsible for planning and carrying out operations that delve into the secrets of the past. Some masterminds are headmasters at academies or universities. Others operate individually and in secret, pursuing agendas that might diverge wildly from those of the rest of their organization.

    <description>Irvan Wastewalker is a young man who has experienced a previous life as a bugbear of the Kryn Dynasty. He was reborn as a nomadic human through the power of the Luxon.

The name "Wastewalker" conjures fear on the plains of Xhorhas, as the name of a clan of Xhorhasian nomads. Irvan- Irv to his friends- was born into that clan, but he hates the name. He left his family when he was a teenager, struck out on his own across the wastes, and made his way to the city of Asarius. Even though the "City of Beasts" is renowned for danger, Irv felt at home there in a way he'd never felt with his clan.
	He earned a reputation for being a party animal who could put down a dozen drinks in a night and still dance with the vigor and elegance of an archfey. Irv is young- just a few weeks past his nineteenth birthday- and he is secretly ashamed of his patchy beard and scrawny, human body. He has a bigger secret related to that feeling: he was consecuted in another life. The act of consecution is a sacred Kryn ritual of rebirth through the mystical power of the Luxon. Irvan has memories of his previous life as a bugbear of Den Hythenos, and he hopes to prove to himself that he can do great things without the aid of his powerful "family" in the Kryn Dynasty.
	He met Ayo and her friends when he traveled to Jigow to experience its contests of strength and skill. He sticks with the group in part because he's interested in what adventures they'll get into, and also because he's smitten with the group's newest addition, a drow arcanist named Galsariad.

    <description>People might laugh when a 12-foot-tall ogre orders a drink at a bar and says her name is Maggie, but they don't laugh for long. Some people fixate on her name, her enormous size, her muscles, or the weapon at her side. Wiser folk take notice of Maggie's bright blue eyes. All her life, people have considered Maggie a stupid meathead because of her size, but her eyes betray her intelligence. She can read others with a glance, whether in conversation or in a duel. When her eyes dart back and forth across a battlefield, they take in enough information to give her allies an advantage in the fight.
	Things changed for Maggie when she first arrived in Jigow and met Ayo Jabe three weeks ago. She came looking for mercenary work to make ends meet but found a true friend instead. Ayo saw the intelligence in Maggie's eyes and was keen to hear Maggie's thoughts. They became fast friends, and Maggie would sooner die than let harm come to her new companion.
	Maggie loves poetry and music with profound lyrics, as well as matching wits with people as clever as she is. She hates being stereotyped and has a dim view of those who are too quick to judge others.

    <description>Marisa's ghost smells faintly of sugar and cinnamon. On her first turn in combat, she wails, "Our home, defiled!" If a character addresses Marisa's ghost by name and apologizes to her on Alyxian's behalf, the ghost says, "Alyxian! When they came for us, I feared they would kill you, too. It is good to hear your voice. Be well, and do not mourn. No one can harm us anymore." After speaking these words, the ghost fades away.

    <description>Moorbounders:
Predators that stalk the marshlands and muddy foothills of Xhorhas, moorbounders are regarded as dangerous killers by those who try to avoid them on their travels- and as prized mounts by those willing to capture and train them. Though the process of domesticating a moorbounder is fraught with peril, these creatures can become favored hunting companions and powerful war mounts.
	Moorbounders hunt with elongated tusks and retractable claws. With a vague resemblance to large hunting cats, their muscular bodies are built for combat, granting them incredible prowess at leaping and a running speed that makes them dominant carnivores.

    <description>Occult extollants delve deep into ancient legends and seek to solve mysteries that have led other investigators to their doom, driven by an unquenchable yearning to know the unknown.

Occultists Of The Vermilion Dream:
The Consortium of the Vermilion Dream is viewed as an esoteric, profit-driven, but ultimately harmless cabal of ghost hunters and perpetuators of urban legends. This perception isn't inaccurate, but the consortium's leadership is obsessed with one set of legends in particular: those involving the Moon of Ill Omen, Ruidus, and the ancient figures cursed by exposure to its alien influence.
	The cruelest desires and predilections of the consortium's most obsessive agents have been enhanced by contact with ruidium-tainted items.

    <description>Olara speaks an ancient dialect that formed the basis for both Elvish and Orc, and any character who speaks and understands either of those languages can converse with her. This is a trait she shares with some of the ghosts of her kinfolk that still haunt the ruins of Cael Morrow, but Olara is no ghost; she is one of the few mortals who survived Gruumsh's attack centuries ago. She subsists on the kelp growing throughout the Drowned City.

    <description>Scholarly agents are low-ranking members of an academic organization. They know a few tricks to help them avoid danger, and they study magic that enables them to decipher secrets of the past and identify magical relics.

Scholars of Allsight:
The Allegiance of Allsight is a scholarly faction that operates primarily within the Marquesian metropolis of Ank'Harel. Though most members of the allegiance are academics unfamiliar with combat, the faction's field agents are skilled archaeologists who are also trained to contend with and overcome the threats that lurk in the depths of Exandria.

    <description>Scholarly masterminds are the formidable leaders of academic research organizations, responsible for planning and carrying out operations that delve into the secrets of the past. Some masterminds are headmasters at academies or universities. Others operate individually and in secret, pursuing agendas that might diverge wildly from those of the rest of their organization.

    <description>A scuttling serpentmaw looks like an unusually large crab with a sleek black shell. It lurks in crevasses and deep underwater canyons. Once spotted, it scuttles toward its prey and reveals its most formidable feature: an armored maw concealed on the back of its shell. This serpentine appendage can extend out from the shell to tear into prey.
	Though they inhabit water, serpentmaws can't swim. They move along the sea floor in small mobs, working together to tear apart much larger creatures they come across.

    <description>Sorrowfish dwell in deep underwater trenches and thus are rarely encountered by surface-dwelling creatures. Some say sorrowfish get their name from their flavor, which is distasteful enough to put the creatures that eat them in a dismal mood. The true sorrow for other creatures comes when the sorrowfish gather in swarms. The malevolent presences that lurk in the abysses of the ocean exert their influence on these fish, transforming their swarms into vicious hordes.
	A single sorrowfish has the game statistics of a quipper (see the Monster Manual), except that it is an Aberration that has immunity to psychic damage.

The effect ends on a creature if the swarm moves out of the creature's space or if another creature within 5 feet of the swarm uses an action to make a DC 14 Strength check, pulling the affected creature out of the swarm on a successful check. On a successful saving throw, a creature takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects.</text>

    <description>A swarm of sorrowfish attacks out of hunger. Although sorrowfish have no sense of fear, they often adopt the tactic of lurking among the petrifying tendrils of a death embrace (described earlier in this appendix), using the tendrils for protection against other predators.

Sorrowfish:
Sorrowfish dwell in deep underwater trenches and thus are rarely encountered by surface-dwelling creatures. Some say sorrowfish get their name from their flavor, which is distasteful enough to put the creatures that eat them in a dismal mood. The true sorrow for other creatures comes when the sorrowfish gather in swarms. The malevolent presences that lurk in the abysses of the ocean exert their influence on these fish, transforming their swarms into vicious hordes.
	A single sorrowfish has the game statistics of a quipper (see the Monster Manual), except that it is an Aberration that has immunity to psychic damage.

      <text>Verin magically creates an echo—a translucent, gray object that looks like him. The echo appears in an unoccupied space Verin can see within 15 feet of himself. While the echo exists, Verin chooses whether each of his attacks originates from his space or the echo's space. On Verin's turn, the echo can move in accordance with Verin's wishes. The echo has AC 17 and 1 hit point. It otherwise uses Verin's statistics. The echo lasts for 1 minute or until it is destroyed, until Verin ends his turn more than 30 feet away from it, until Verin manifests another echo, or until Verin is incapacitated.</text>

    <description>To the people of Bazzoxan, Verin is a beacon of hope amid the darkness that shrouds the town. But the weight of responsibility colors Verin's otherwise bright and youthful demeanor with melancholy. He cares about the town he has sworn to protect, but he is weary of the incessant threat posed by the denizens of the Betrayers' Rise.
