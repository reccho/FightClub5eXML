      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Humanoid elephants, loxodons are often oases of calm in the busy streets of Ravnica. They hum or chant in their sonorous tones and move slowly or sit in perfect stillness. Provoked to action, loxodons are holy terrors—bellowing with rage, trumpeting and flapping their ears. Their still wisdom and their furious strength—as well as their fierce loyalty and unwavering conviction—are tremendous assets to their guilds.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Lumbering Giants</name>
      <text>Loxodons tower above most other humanoids, standing over seven feet tall. They have the heads—trunks, tusks, ears, and faces—of elephants, and hulking humanoid bodies covered by thick, leathery skin. Their hands have four thick digits, and their feet are the flat, ovalshaped feet of elephants.
	Like that of an elephant, a loxodon's trunk is a useful appendage that supplements the hands. In addition to providing a keen sense of smell, the trunk can be used to lift and carry even heavy objects, and the two finger-like protrusions at the tip are capable of delicate manipulation. The trunk can be used to carry both food and liquid to the mouth and can even act as a snorkel.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Gifted Stoneworkers</name>
      <text>Loxodons are tireless, patient artisans, with an unrivaled intuition about their craft. While they make nurturing spiritual leaders, their gift at stonework is so natural that they are often at a loss when it comes to imparting their knowledge to others. Among the Selesnya, it primarily falls to them to build the guild's magnificent cathedral-like arboretum structures.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Relentlessly Loyal</name>
      <text>Loxodons believe in the value of community and life, and thus are most often found in the Selesnya Conclave. Some who stress the benefits of order have been known to join the Orzhov Syndicate or the Azorius Senate.
	Loxodons believe that the members of a group have a responsibility to look out for each other. Once they have joined a guild or bonded with other individuals in any capacity, they devote themselves to maintaining that bond. They coordinate their efforts and are often willing to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the group. They expect the same loyalty and commitment from the other members of their communities and can be severe in their disappointment when their trust is betrayed.
	The primary difference among loxodons who join different guilds is their sense of the size of the communities they belong to. For loxodons in the Selesnya Conclave, the community is the world and all living beings in it, all valuable, all meant to live in harmony, and all interdependent. For Azorius loxodons, community primarily means the society of sentient races, who need law and order in order to function together. For those in the Orzhov Syndicate, community means the syndicate, with its interests taking priority over those of any other group.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Loxodon Names</name>
      <text>A loxodon's name includes overtones of sound, produced in a loxodon's resonant nasal chambers, that indicate status, family connection, and community role. Since most members of other races can't hear or distinguish these tones, let alone produce them, loxodons often translate them into titles, such as Hierarch, Revered, Grandmother, Healer, or Saint.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Description</name>
      <text>The Simic Combine uses magic to fuse different life forms together. In recent years, they have extended this research to humanoid subjects, magically transferring the traits of various animals into humans, elves, and vedalken. The goal of the so-called Guardian Project is to build a Simic army of superior soldiers, perfectly adapted to a variety of combat situations. These hyper-evolved specimens are called Simic hybrids, though they sometimes call themselves guardians.

Source:	Unearthed Arcana: Races Of Ravnica p. 2</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Extensive Adaptation</name>
      <text>Simic hybrids share many of the characteristics of their original race, including their basic physical form. Human hybrids are the most versatile, filling a variety of roles. Agile elf hybrids retain the ability to see in darkness, making them ideal as spies, scouts, and infiltrators. And vedalken hybrids possess the same calculating intellect as other vedalken, making them superior tacticians, strategists, and spellcasters.
	Hybrids' biological enhancements can change their appearance drastically. All hybrids possess some physical characteristics of animals, mostly aquatic and reptilian creatures. These include crab claws, squid tentacles, wings that look like mays or fins, translucent or camouflaged skin, or sharklike maws filled with sharp teeth.
	Hybrids are the product of Simic magic. It's not impossible for a hybrid to leave the Simic Combine and join another guild, but the Simic would consider the hybrid a deserter and the new guild might never fully welcome a hybrid who could easily be a Simic spy.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Hybrid Names</name>
      <text>A hybrid usually bears the name given by their human, elf, or vedalken parents. But some hybrids assume a new name after their transformation, a name chosen by themselves or by those who transformed them.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Age</name>
      <text>Hybrids begin their lives as adult humans, elves, or vedalken. They exhibit signs of slightly accelerated aging, so their maximum lifespans are probably reduced somewhat, but the Guardian Project has not been operating long enough to observe the full effect of this phenomenon.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Alignment</name>
      <text>Most hybrids share the generally neutral outlook of the Simic Combine as a whole. They are more interested in scientific research and the standing of their guild than in moral or ethical questions. However, those who leave the Combine often do so because their philosophical outlook and alignment are more in line with a different guild's.</text>

    <trait category="species">
      <name>Animal Enhancement</name>
      <text>Your body has been altered to incorporate certain animal characteristics. You choose one animal enhancement now and a second enhancement at 5th level.
	At 1st level, choose one of the following options:

	• Manta Glide. Your ray-like wings can slow your fall and allow you to glide. When you fall and aren't incapacitated, you can subtract up to 100 feet from the fall when calculating falling damage, and you can move up to 2 feet horizontally for every 1 foot you descend.

	• Nimble Climber. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.

	• Underwater Adaptation. You can breathe air and water, and you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

At 5th level, choose one of the following options, or choose one of the options you didn't take at 1st level:

	• Grappling Appendage. You have two special appendages growing alongside your arms. Choose whether they're both claws or tentacles. Each of these appendages is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Immediately after hitting, you can try to grapple the target as a bonus action. These appendages can't precisely manipulate anything and can't wield weapons, magic items, or other specialized equipment.

	• Carapace. Your skin in places is covered by a thick shell. You gain a +1 bonus to AC when you're not wearing heavy armor.

	• Acid Spit. As an action, you can spray a stream of acid from glands in your mouth, targeting one creature or object you can see within 30 feet of you. The target takes 2d10 acid damage unless it succeeds on a Dexterity saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 11th level (3d10) and 17th level (4d10).</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Nothing is perfect. Vedalken not only believe this fact, they rejoice in it. Every imperfection is a chance for improvement, and progress is an endless march toward a state of perfection that can never be reached. This viewpoint leads vedalken to pursue their work with delighted enthusiasm, never deterred by setbacks and excited by every opportunity for improvement.

    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Cool Rationality</name>
      <text>Vedalken are tall and slender, standing almost a head taller than humans on average but weighing about the same. Their hairless skin covers a range of shades of blue, from pale sky blue through bright azure to deep indigo, almost purple. Their eyes are darker shades of blue or violet. They lack external ears, and their noses are broad and flat.
	As a rule, vedalken are gregarious in conversation. However, they are private concerning their personal lives, and they tend to engage more with ideas than with people. They form close friendships based on mutual interests or compelling disagreements, and their interactions focus on their thoughts about those issues rather than their feelings about them.
	To members of other races, vedalken often appear cold, even emotionless. That assessment isn't fair—they feel emotion every bit as vividly as other races, but they are skilled at not displaying it. Cool rationality guides their actions, they make and follow careful plans, and they are patient enough to do nothing at all when the ideal outcome relies on inaction.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Reasoning toward Perfection</name>
      <text>Reasoning toward Perfection Their curious intellects and rational minds incline vedalken strongly toward membership in the Azorius Senate, the Simic Combine, and (less often) the Izzet League. Whatever their guild affiliation, they put their intelligence to use in crafting and improving things: laws, procedures, and magical sciences.
	Vedalken believe that the path toward the impossible goal of perfection is built with bricks of education, careful deliberation, and controlled experimentation. (Their desire for close control to prevent disastrous mistakes makes them generally less inclined toward the Izzet League, where explosive mistakes are celebrated.) Some vedalken direct their energy toward perfecting themselves, including by means of Simic bioengineering or through extensive study, while others focus on perfecting society through the careful crafting and application of laws.</text>

      <text>Many reptiles derive their body warmth and energy from the sun, but the humanoid viashino are fueled by an inner fire of zeal. Open with their emotions, viashino can be hot-tempered, but they are also quick to their hissing laughter, and they easily form close bonds of friendship. They are fierce warriors and passionate advocates for their guilds and causes.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Scaled Skin and Tail Blades</name>
      <text>Viashino resemble humanoid lizards covered in green, scaled skin and spiky protrusions. Their heads jut forward from their slender necks and bear huge mouths full of sharp teeth. Long, whiplike tails extend from their spines, lashing behind them—faster and faster as they grow more agitated. Their tails are tipped with bony blades they can use as weapons.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Fervent and Fiery</name>
      <text>Viashino are fiercely emotional and often violent, and their wizards and sorcerers favor fire spells that reflect their inner fire. They are most common among the Gruul Clans, especially the Slizt clan. Occasionally they put their zealous fire to use in the service of higher ideals, joining the Boros Legion. Other viashino instead pursue careers in the Izzet League, where they find a special role wielding Izzet-designed flamespewing scorchbringers.
	Like fire itself, viashino are quick to leap from one situation to another, and they are frequently destructive in the process. They enjoy brawling and often cause more injury than intended, thanks to their teeth and bladed tails.
	They're also easily distracted, jumping from one idea to another in an instant. Likewise, they're easily bored, and if nothing captures their attention, they'll do something interesting.</text>
