  <description>Many of the character concepts that were once prestige classes or paragon paths in earlier editions of D&amp;D are now options available to 1st-level characters. In general, the game's design aims for maximum flexibility, making options available to all characters. As such, prestige classes build on the game's broad range of basic options to represent specialized options and unique training.</description>
