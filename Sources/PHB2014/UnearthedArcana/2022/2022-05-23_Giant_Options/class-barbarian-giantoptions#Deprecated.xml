        <name>Primal Path: Path Of The Giant (UA)</name>
        <text>Barbarians who walk the Path of the Giant draw strength from the primal forces that are the Giants and their elemental ilk. Their rages surge with elemental power and cause these barbarians to grow in size, transforming them into avatars of primordial might.
	During their rage, a barbarian may take after a legendary storm giant, hair turning white and eyes crackling with lightning. Others adopt the monstrous features of apocalyptic titans, rending the world around them so that it may be made anew.

        <name>Giant Power (Path Of The Giant (UA))</name>
        <text>When you choose this path at 3rd level, you learn to speak, read, and write Giant or one other language of your choice if you already know Giant. Additionally, you learn either the druidcraft or thaumaturgy cantrip (your choice). Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

        <name>Giant's Havoc (Path Of The Giant (UA))</name>
        <text>Also at 3rd level, your rages pull strength from the primal might of giants, transforming you into a hulking force of destruction. While raging, you gain the following benefits:

Crushing Hurl. When you make a successful ranged attack with a thrown weapon using Strength, you can add your Rage Damage bonus to the attack's damage roll.

Giant Stature. Your reach increases by 5 feet, and if you are smaller than Large, you become Large, along with anything you are wearing. If there isn't enough room for you to become Large, your size doesn't change.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Elemental Cleaver (Path Of The Giant (UA))</name>
        <text>At 6th level, your bond with the elemental might of giants and their ilk grows, and you learn to infuse weapons with primordial energy.
	When you enter your rage, you can infuse one weapon of your choice that you are holding with one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, thunder, or lightning. While you wield the infused weapon during your rage, the weapon's damage type changes to the chosen type, it deals an extra 1d6 damage of the chosen type when it hits, and it gains the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If you throw the weapon, it reappears in your hand the instant after it hits or misses a target. The infused weapon's benefits are suppressed while a creature other than you wields it.
	While raging and holding the infused weapon, you can use a bonus action to change the infused weapon's current damage type to a different one from the above damage types.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Mighty Impel (Path Of The Giant (UA))</name>
        <text>Beginning at 10th level, your connection to giant strength now allows you to hurl both allies and enemies on the battlefield. As a bonus action while raging, you can choose one Medium or smaller creature within your reach and move it to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of yourself. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) to avoid the effect.
	If, at the end of this movement, the thrown creature isn't on a surface or liquid that can support it, the creature falls, taking damage as normal and landing prone.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Demiurgic Colossus (Path Of The Giant (UA))</name>
        <text>At 24th level, the primordial power of your rage intensifies. When you rage, your reach now increases by 10 feet, your size can increase to Huge, and you can now use your Mighty Impel to move creatures that are Large or smaller.
	In addition, the extra damage dealt by your Elemental Cleaver feature increases to 2d6.
