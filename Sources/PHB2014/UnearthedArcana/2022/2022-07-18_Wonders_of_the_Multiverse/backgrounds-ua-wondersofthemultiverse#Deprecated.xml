	• Languages: Two of your choice (Abyssal, Celestial, or Infernal recommended)
	• Equipment: A ring of keys to unknown locks, a blank book, an ink pen or quill, a bottle of black ink, a set of traveler's clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp

d6 | Personality Trait
1 | Strange events and otherworldly creatures don't phase me.
2 | I think in terms of exchange; something for something, nothing for nothing.
3 | I speak with an unusual cadence.
4 | I pepper my speech with borrowed words or curses from planar languages.
5 | I've seen enough to know that you can't take anyone at face value, so I scrutinize everyone I deal with.
6 | I have a superstitious habit I picked up, such as touching iron when I'm nervous or arranging objects in a specific order.

d6 | Trinket
1 | A tiny vial pendant, filled with a drip of honey that glows faintly
2 | A small lead ingot with a strange thumbprint pressed into it that whispers when held tightly

    <trait>
      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Though you aren't a Giant, you grew up among giants. Maybe you were an orphan taken in by a sympathetic family of stone giants who raised you as one of their own. Or perhaps you lived in a lost prehistoric pocket of the world, surrounded by giants and fearsome behemoths or hulking dinosaurs.
	Something about your environment—perhaps the food or water that sustained you through childhood, elemental magic inherent in the site of your home, or some verdant blessing of growth placed on you—ensured that you grew to a remarkable size. With the aid of this magic, you have learned how to embody the titanic might of giants. You are used to moving through a world much bigger than you, and that is reflected in your skills, attitude, and perspective on life.

	• Skill Proficiencies: Intimidation, Survival
	• Languages: Two of your choice
	• Equipment: A backpack, a set of traveler's clothes, a small stone or sprig that reminds you of home, and a pouch containing 10 gp

      <text>How you came to live among colossal creatures is up to you to determine, but the Foundling Origin table suggests a variety of possibilities.

Origin Stories:
d6 | Origin
1 | You were found as a baby by a family of nomadic giants who raised you as one of their own.
2 | A family of stone giants rescued you when you fell into a mountain crag, and you have lived with them underground ever since.
3 | You were lost or abandoned as a child in a jungle that teemed with ravenous dinosaurs. There, you found an equally lost frost giant and together, you survived.
4 | Your farm was crushed and your family killed in a battle between warring groups of giants. Racked with guilt over the destruction, a sympathetic giant soldier promised to care for you.
5 | After you had a series of strange dreams as a child, your superstitious parents sent you to study with a powerful but aloof storm giant oracle.
6 | While playing hide-and-seek with your friends, you stumbled into the castle of a cloud giant matriarch, who immediately adopted you.</text>

d6 | Personality Trait
1 | What I lack in stature, I make up for with sheer spite.
2 | Sometimes size does matter, okay? If I see a beast bigger than me, I'm immediately running away.
3 | Crowded spaces make me uncomfortable. I'd much rather be in a wide-open field than a bustling tavern.
4 | I like being small. It helps me stay unnoticed—and underestimated.
5 | Size is just half the story. Every avalanche begins as a single pebble.
6 | The world always feels too big, and I'm afraid I'll never find my place in it.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Description</name>
      <text>You've dedicated your life to studying the practice of runecraft. Whether you were personally taught by a master rune carver or learned by poring over engravings in ancient ruins, you understand how to tap into the supernatural power held within runes.
	The art of runecraft was initially created by the giants of yore, but over time, the practice has been adopted by individuals of all races and backgrounds. As such, though Giant runes are the most common, many rune carvers incorporate symbols from their native languages into the craft.

	• Skill Proficiencies: History, Perception
	• Languages: Giant and one other language of your choice
	• Equipment: A set of artisan's tools (one of your choice), a small knife, a whetstone, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp

5 | You carve runes on a set of animal bones you can throw in different formations.
6 | You draw your runes into candles, melting the wax to smooth over the engravings.</text>

d6 | Personality Trait
1 | Is it practical to learn an ancient language that is rarely used in everyday speech? No. But is it fun? Very.
2 | I learned one of my ancestors was a lauded rune carver whose story was lost to time. I seek to rekindle that legacy.
3 | The old, traditional markings of runecraft look so boring. Why not give your runes some flair?
4 | In my studies of runes, I strive to understand how great civilizations of the past fell, so that I may prevent it from happening to societies of the present.
5 | Life may be a whirlwind of chaos around me, but whenever I create my runes, I feel at peace.
6 | My brain struggles to process ink words written on paper, but the tactile feeling of carved runes makes my mind sing.</text>
