    <prerequisite>4th Level, Scion of the Outer Planes (Lawful Outer Plane) Feat</prerequisite>
    <text>You can channel cosmic forces of order that lock the multiverse into patterns. Your actions are your own to choose, but these forces grant you the following benefits:

Ability Score Increase. Increase an ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.

Stasis Strike. Once per turn when you damage a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself, you can deal an extra 1d8 force damage to the target, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + the modifier of the ability score increased by this feat) or be restrained by spectral bindings until the start of your next turn. These bindings manifest as chains, gears, encasing stone, or some other symbol of stasis. You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

    <prerequisite>4th Level, Scion of the Outer Planes (Chaotic Outer Plane) Feat</prerequisite>
    <text>You can channel the cosmic forces of chaos that drive the multiverse toward both freedom and disarray. Your actions are still yours to choose, but you gain these benefits:

Ability Score Increase. Increase an ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.

Chaotic Flare. When you roll a 1 or a 20 on an attack roll or a saving throw, the magic of chaos flows through you. Roll on the Chaotic Flares table to determine what happens. A flare lasts until the end of your next turn, and a new flare can't occur until after the first flare ends.

Chaotic Flares:
d4 | Flare
1 | Disruption Field. Waves of energy ripple in a 10-foot sphere centered on you. Every creature other than you that starts its turn in that area, or that moves into that area for the first time on a turn, takes 1d8 force damage.
2 | Battle Fury. A creature of your choice that you can see is filled with reckless fury. The creature has advantage on attack rolls and disadvantage on ability checks.
3 | Unbound. When you move, you can use some or all of your walking speed to teleport once, along with any equipment you're wearing or carrying, up to the distance used to an unoccupied space that you can see.
4 | Wailing Winds. Howling winds swirl around you in a 60-foot radius. You and any creature in that radius has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws.

You can also forcibly release a chaotic flare as a bonus action, rolling on the table as normal to determine the effects. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Frigid Retaliation. Immediately after a creature you can see within 30 feet of you hits you with an attack roll and deals damage, you can use your reaction to retaliate with a conjured blast of ice. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + the modifier of the ability increased by this feat). On a failed save, it takes 1d8 + your proficiency bonus cold damage, and its speed is halved until the end of its next turn. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Planar Adaptation. When you finish a long rest, you gain resistance to either acid, cold, or fire damage (your choice) until you finish your next long rest.

Portal Cracker. Your experience with portals allows you to operate them without the proper portal key. As an action, you can concentrate on a portal you're aware of that is within 5 feet of you and make a DC 20 Wisdom (Survival) check. On a failure, you take 3d8 force damage and you can't use this feature on that portal again until you finish a long rest. On a success, you can force the portal open or closed for 1 hour. For that duration, a portal closed in this way doesn't respond to its portal key unless a creature employing the key succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check as an action.

Portal Sense. You know the direction to the last planar portal you used while you and the portal are on the same plane. Moreover, as an action, you can detect the location of any portals within 30 feet of you that aren't behind total cover. Once you detect a portal with this action, you can't use the action again until you finish a long rest.
