    <name>Gift of the Chromatic Dragon (UA)</name>
    <text>You've manifested some of the power of chromatic dragons, granting you the following benefits:

	• As a bonus action, you can touch a simple or martial weapon and infuse it with one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. For the next minute, the weapon deals an extra 1d4 damage of the chosen type when it hits. After you use this ability, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

	• When you take acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage, you can use your reaction to give yourself resistance to that instance of damage. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

    <name>Gift of the Metallic Dragon (UA)</name>
    <text>You've manifested some of the power of metallic dragons, granting you the following benefits:

	• You learn the cure wounds spell. You can cast this spell without expending a spell slot. Once you cast this spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast this spell using spell slots you have. The spell's spellcasting ability is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma when you cast it with this feat (choose when you gain the feat).

	• You can manifest protective wings that can shield you or others from attacks. When you or another creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to manifest spectral wings from your back for a moment. Roll a d4 and grant a bonus to the target's AC equal to the number rolled against that attack roll, potentially causing it to miss. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

    <name>Gift of the Gem Dragon (UA)</name>
    <text>You've manifested some of the power of gem dragons, granting you the following benefits:

	• Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

	• When you take damage from a creature that is within 10 feet of you, you can use your reaction to emanate telekinetic energy. The creature that dealt damage to you must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + the ability modifier of the score increased by this feat) or take 2d8 force damage and be pushed 10 feet away from you. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
