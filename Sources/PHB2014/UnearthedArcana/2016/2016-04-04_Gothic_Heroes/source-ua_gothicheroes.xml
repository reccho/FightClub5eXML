  <description>If you played AD&amp;D second edition back in the 1990s, you probably remember kits. These character options were introduced in The Complete Fighter's Handbook, and became a mainstay of the rest of the books in the Player's Handbook Rules Supplement series. Though kits were notorious for providing wildly uneven benefits (some offered all-but-unnoticeable improvements, while others turned characters into walking engines of destruction), they did add depth and customization to a game that had previously offered few character choices after 1st level.

This month, Unearthed Arcana converts a few of the more popular kits from that era to new class options for the bard and fighter. If you played second edition AD&amp;D, what are some of your favorite kits that you'd like to see converted to fifth edition? Let me know on Twitter (@mikemearls). Over the course of the year, the kits that inspire the most discussion could very well end up here.</description>
