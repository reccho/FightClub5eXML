  <description>This month, Unearthed Arcana presents two new options that allow arcane casters to express their faith in the gods.

For wizards, the Theurgy arcane tradition creates a magic-user whose arcane instruction is guided by the teachings of a deity, and who gains the benefits of a divine domain.</description>
