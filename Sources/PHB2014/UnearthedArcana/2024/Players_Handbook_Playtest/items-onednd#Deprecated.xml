Mastery (Vex, Prerequisite: Ammunition, Finesse, or Light Property): If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to the creature, you have Advantage on your next attack roll against that creature before the end of your next turn.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

    <text>Mastery (Slow, Prerequisite: None): If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to the creature, you can reduce its Speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. If you hit the creature more than once with this property, the Speed reduction doesn't exceed 10 feet.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

    <text>When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with a throw of the Net at a creature within 15 feet of yourself. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Dexterity modifier. The target succeeds automatically if it's Huge or larger.

On a failed save, the target has the Restrained condition until it escapes the Net. To escape, the target must use its action to make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check, escaping on a success. A creature within 5 feet of the target can use its action to attempt the same thing. Destroying the Net (AC 10; 5 HP; immunity to Bludgeoning, Poison, and Psychic damage) also frees the target, ending the effect.

Restrained:
	â€¢ A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
	â€¢ Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.
	â€¢ The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.
