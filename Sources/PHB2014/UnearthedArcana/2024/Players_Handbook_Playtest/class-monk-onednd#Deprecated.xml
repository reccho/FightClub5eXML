        <name>Martial Arts</name>
        <text>Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use your Unarmed Strike and Monk Weapons, which are Simple Melee Weapons and Martial Weapons with the Light property.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only Monk Weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a Shield:

Bonus Unarmed Strike:
You can make one Unarmed Strike as a Bonus Action.

Dexterous Attacks:
You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your Unarmed Strikes and Monk Weapons. In addition, when you choose the Grapple or Shove option, you can use your Dexterity modifier instead of Strength to determine the saving throw DC.

Martial Arts Die:
You can roll a d6 in place of the normal damage of your Unarmed Strike or Monk Weapons. This die changes as you gain Monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table. (d8 at level 5, d10 at level 11, d12 at level 17)

        <text>Your self-discipline and martial training allow you to harness a well of extraordinary energy within yourself. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of Discipline Points. Your Monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Discipline Points column of the Monk table.

You can spend these points to fuel certain Monk features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind, each of which is detailed below.

When you spend a Discipline Point, it is unavailable until you finish a Short Rest or Long Rest, at the end of which you regain all your expended points.

Some features that use Discipline Points require your target to make a saving throw. The saving throw DC equals 8 plus your Proficiency Bonus plus your Wisdom modifier.

Flurry of Blows:
You can spend 1 Discipline Point to make two Unarmed Strikes as a Bonus Action.

Patient Defense:
You can take the Disengage action as a Bonus Action. Alternatively, you can spend 1 Discipline Point to take both the Disengage and the Dodge actions as a Bonus Action.

Step of the Wind:
You can take the Dash action as a Bonus Action. Alternatively, you can spend 1 Discipline Point to take both the Disengage and Dash actions as a Bonus Action, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can spend 1 Discipline Point to redirect some of the attack's force. If you do so, choose a creature within 5 feet of you if the attack was a melee attack or 60 feet of yourself that isn't behind Total Cover if the attack was a ranged attack. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die plus your Dexterity modifier. The damage is the same type dealt by the attack.
