    <text>The wizard Mordenkainen crafted this sleek, golden helmet. If he created other helms of disjunction, they have yet to be found.
	As an action while wearing this helm, you can use it to emit an antimagic pulse in a 300-foot-radius sphere centered on yourself. The pulse has the following effects:

Magic Item Disjunction: Potions and scrolls in the area are destroyed. All other magic items in the area have their magical properties suppressed for 1 minute. Artifacts are unaffected by this property, as are magic items on your person.

Spell Disjunction: Any ongoing spell ends if the creature, object, or area affected by it is even partly in the pulse's area.

Wave of Force: The antimagic pulse is strong enough to knock down creatures close to you. Each creature within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or have the prone condition.

Once you use the helm's property, it can't be used again until 1d4 days have passed.

    <text>This walking stick has a brilliant gemstone fitted at the top. This staff has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.
	As an action, you can expend 1 charge from the staff to create two linked teleportation portals, each one appearing on a flat surface of your choice that you can see within 1,500 feet of yourself. Alternatively, you can expend 1 charge as an action to relocate one or both portals, subject to the same limitation. The surface on which a portal appears must be big enough to accommodate it. Each portal is a two-dimensional, glowing oval ring, and together they create an open doorway up to 6 feet high and 4 feet wide. Any creature or object entering one portal exits from the other as if the two portals were a single opening that connects their locations.
	A portal can appear on a moving surface, but the effect ends when the two portals move more than 1 mile apart. As a bonus action while holding the staff, you can close both portals (ending the effect) or suppress one portal, causing it to disappear until you relocate it (see above), during which time the remaining portal can't be used. The portals otherwise last for 24 hours.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Proficiency: simple, quarterstaff

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>Resembling a small dragon's horn, this arcane device glows with a hellish internal light when held. As an action while holding this horn, you can invoke a necromantic effect called the Beckoning Death.
	The Beckoning Death arrives at the start of your next turn and manifests as a crimson cloud of smoke that fills a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the horn. The sphere doesn't move with the horn. At the start of each of your turns, the sphere's radius increases by 30 feet. The cloud disappears after 10 minutes or when your concentration on the effect ends. Any creature (including you) that has 9 or fewer hit points when it ends its turn in the cloud is slain by the Beckoning Death. A Humanoid killed in this way instantly transforms into a zombie (see the Monster Manual). The zombie obeys the commands of the horn's creator, the lich Szass Tam.
	Once you use the horn's property, it can't be used again for 1 year.

    <text>Forged by Red Wizards using a secret process known only to them, this grim steel dagger draws its power from the Negative Plane. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using this magic dagger, the target takes an extra 3d12 necrotic damage.
	A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this weapon dies and can't be raised from the dead except by a deity or by a creature using a tablet of reawakening to cast the true resurrection spell.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Proficiency: simple, dagger

    <text>Witches of Rashemen created this Tiny stone tablet to counter the necromancy of the Red Wizards. As an action, you can cast true resurrection from the tablet. Once used in this way, the tablet turns to dust and is destroyed.
