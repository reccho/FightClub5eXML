  <description>A handful of characters from the film Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves are presented here as NPCs you can include in your D&amp;D campaigns. The stat blocks in this collection use a presentation similar to that which is found in the Monster Manual. If you are unfamiliar with the stat block format, read the introduction of the Monster Manual before proceeding further. That book explains stat block terminology and gives rules for various monster traitsâ€”information that isn't repeated here.

Adventurers and villains often need legendary magic items to accomplish their goals. Such items aren't easy to acquire. They might be found in the hands of dangerous adversaries or locked away and guarded by traps in hidden places.

The items in this collection were created for the film Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves. Each one can tilt the balance of power in any D&amp;D game, so use these items with caution.</description>
