  <description>In February, we presented a revised version of a new character class: the artificer, a master of magical invention. Today we return to that class, now with even more content! Here's what's been added:

	• New subclasses—the Archivist and the Battle Smith
	• A revised spell list, including spells from Xanathar's Guide to Everything
	• New infusions—Enhanced Wand, Repeating Shot, and Repulsion Shield
	• ~~A revision to multiclassing—round up when determining spell slots~~

We're considering various changes to the class, but we'd love to hear from you before we start the remodeling. With that in mind, we invite you to give this new version of the artificer a read and to try it out in play. Soon a survey will appear on the D&amp;D website. Please let us know in that survey what you think of the artificer.</description>
