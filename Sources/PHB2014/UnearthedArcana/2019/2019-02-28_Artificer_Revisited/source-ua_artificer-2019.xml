  <description>In a previous installment of Unearthed Arcana, we presented a new character class: the artificer, a master of magical invention. Based on the feedback we received, we now offer a new look at this class. We invite you to give this new version of the artificer a read, try it out in play, and let us know what you think. Later this month, a survey will appear on the D&amp;D website. Please let us know in that survey what you think of today's Unearthed Arcana.</description>
