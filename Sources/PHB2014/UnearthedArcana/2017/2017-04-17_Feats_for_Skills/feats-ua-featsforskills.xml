    <text>Your extensive study of religion rewards you with the following benefits:

	• Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

	• You gain proficiency in the Religion skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.

	• You learn the thaumaturgy and detect evil and good spells. You can cast detect evil and good once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
