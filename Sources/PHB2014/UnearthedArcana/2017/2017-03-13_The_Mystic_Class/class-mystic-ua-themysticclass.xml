      <name>Mystic</name>
      <text>A human clad in simple robes walks along a forest path. A gang of goblins emerges from the brush, arrows trained on him, their smiles wide at their good fortune of finding such easy prey for the legion's slave pens. Their smiles turn to shrieks of terror as the traveler grows to giant size and leaps at them, his staff now a deadly cudgel.
	The militia forms in ranks to prepare for the orcs' charge. The growling brutes howl their battle cries and surge forward. To their surprise, the human rabble holds its ground and fights with surprising ferocity. Suddenly, mindless fear clings to the orcs' minds and they, despite facing a far inferior foe, turn and run, never noticing the calm half-elf standing amid the militia and directing its efforts.
	Baron von Ludwig was always proud of his grand library. Little did he know that each evening, a gnome laden with blank scrolls slipped past his guards each night and dutifully copied his most heavily guarded archives. When the duke's men arrived to arrest him for dealing with demons, he never guessed that the gnome scribe traveling with them had spent more time in his keep than he had over the past year.
	These heroes are all mystics, followers of a strange and mysterious form of power. Mystics shun the world to turn their eyes inward, mastering the full potential of their minds and exploring their psyches before turning to face the world. Mystics are incredibly rare, and most prefer to keep the nature of their abilities secret. Using their inner, psychic strength, they can read minds, fade into invisibility, transform their bodies into living iron, and seize control of the physical world and bend it to their will.

      <name>Hermits and Outcasts</name>
      <text>Mystics are loners. Most discover the secrets of their power through vague references in tomes of lore or by ingratiating themselves to a master of the power.
	In order to master their power, mystics must first master themselves. They spend months and years in quiet contemplation, exploring their minds and leaving nothing uncovered. During this time, they shun society and typically live as hermits at the edge of society. A mystic who studied under a master worked as a virtual slave, toiling away at mundane tasks in return for the occasional lesson or cryptic insight.
	When mystics finally master their power, they return to the world to broaden their horizons and practice their craft. Some mystics prefer to remain isolated, but those who become adventurers aren't content to remain on the fringe of the world.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Eccentric Minds</name>
      <text>In order to maintain the strict discipline and intense self-knowledge needed to tap into their power, mystics develop a variety of practices to keep their focus sharp.
	These practices are reflected in taboos and quirks, strange little behaviors that govern a mystic's actions. These quirks are oaths or behavioral tics that help keep mystics in the proper frame of mind while maintaining perfect control over their minds and bodies.
	While these taboos are harmless, they help cast mystics as outsiders. Few feel accepted by society, and fewer still care to become integrated with it. To mystics, the life of the mind is where they feel most at home.</text>

      <name>Selecting Quirks</name>
      <text>To add some texture to your mystic, consider the quirks your character has acquired. These behaviors have no game effect, but your character might become irritated or upset if forced to break them. They're a great roleplaying tool to add character to the game. You can roll on or pick from the table below, or create your own quirks. Aim to create two quirks, to give them more of a chance to come into play. Finally, consider why your character chose these behaviors. What do they say about your character's personality or background? Are they based on a specific incident or a belief?

Mystic Quirks:
d20 | Quirk
1 | You never cut your hair.
2 | You refuse to wear clothes of a specific color.
3 | You never say your name.
4 | You never wear footwear.
5 | You always wear a mask.
6 | You dye your hair bright blue or green.
7 | You pick a new name each day.
8 | You never immerse yourself in water.
9 | You sleep on bare earth.
10 | You never consume alcohol.
11 | You wear a veil to conceal your face.
12 | You always wear a specific piece of clothing.
13 | You refuse to light fires.
14 | You refuse to write things down, instead using pictograms.
15 | You never sit on a chair, preferring to stand or sit on the floor.
16 | You never answer to any name but your own.
17 | You write down the name of each creature you slay, and name ones that are unnamed.
18 | You consume only water and raw vegetables.
19 | You spend any money you earn within 1 week of gaining it.
20 | You often speak to an imaginary companion, and act only with its blessing.</text>

      <name>Creating a Mystic</name>
      <text>When creating a mystic, consider your character's background. How did you become a mystic? What first drew you to this practice? Are you self-taught, or did you have a master? If you had a master, what is that relationship like?
	Consider also why you returned to the world from your hermitage. Did you leave someone or something behind when you took up your studies? Are you driven by revenge or some other motivation?

Quick Build:
You can make a mystic quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity or Constitution. Second, choose the hermit background.</text>

      <feature>
        <name>Psionics</name>
        <text>As a student of psionics, you can master and use psionic talents and disciplines, the rules for which appear at the end of this document. Psionics is a special form of magic use, distinct from spellcasting.

Psionic Talents:
A psionic talent is a minor psionic effect you have mastered. At 1st level, you know one psionic talent of your choice. You learn additional talents of your choice at higher levels. The Talents Known column of the Mystic table shows the total number of talents you know at each level; when that number goes up for you, choose a new talent.

Psionic Disciplines:
A psionic discipline is a rigid set of mental exercises that allows a Mystic to manifest psionic power. A Mystic masters only a few disciplines at a time.
	At 1st level, you know one psionic discipline of your choice. The Disciplines Known column of the Mystic table shows the total number of disciplines you know at each level; when that number goes up for you, choose a new discipline.
	In addition, whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one discipline you know with a different one of your choice.

Psi Points:
You have an internal reservoir of energy that can be devoted to psionic disciplines you know. This energy is represented by psi points. Each psionic discipline describes effects you can create with it by spending a certain number of psi points. A psionic talent requires no psi points.
	The number of psi points you have is based on your Mystic level, as shown in the Psi Points column of the Mystic table. The number shown for your level is your psi point maximum. Your psi point total returns to its maximum when you finish a long rest. The number of psi points you have can't go below 0 or over your maximum.

Psi Limit:
Though you have access to a potent amount of psionic energy, it takes training and practice to channel that energy. There is a limit on the number of psi points you can spend to activate a psionic discipline. The limit is based on your Mystic level, as shown in the Psi Limit column of the Mystic table. For example, as a 3rd-level Mystic, you can spend no more than 3 psi points on a discipline each time you use it, no matter how many psi points you have.

Psychic Focus:
You can focus psionic energy on one of your psionic disciplines to draw ongoing benefits from it. As a bonus action, you can choose one of your psionic disciplines and gain its psychic focus benefit, which is detailed in that discipline's description. The benefit lasts until you are incapacitated or until you use another bonus action to choose a different focus benefit.
	You can have only one psychic focus benefit at a time, and using the psychic focus of one discipline doesn't limit your ability to use other disciplines.

Psionic Ability:
Intelligence is your psionic ability for your psionic disciplines. You use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a psionic discipline or when making an attack roll with one.

        <name>Psionic Disciplines and Talents</name>
        <text>Psionic talents and disciplines are the heart of a Mystic's craft. They are the mental exercises and psionic formulae used to forge will into tangible, magical effects.
	Psionic disciplines were each discovered by different orders and tend to reflect their creators' specialties. However, a Mystic can learn any discipline regardless of its associated order.

Source:	Unearthed Arcana: The Mystic Class p. 1</text>
      </feature>
      <feature>
        <name>Using a Discipline</name>
        <text>Each psionic discipline has several ways you can use it, all contained in its description. The discipline specifies the type of action and number of psi points it requires. It also details whether you must concentrate on its effects, how many targets it affects, what saving throws it requires, and so on.
	The following sections go into more detail on using a discipline. Psionic disciplines are magical and function similarly to spells.

Psychic Focus:
The Psychic Focus section of a discipline describes the benefit you gain when you choose that discipline for your psychic focus.

Effect Options and Psi Points:
A discipline provides different options for how to use it with your psi points. Each effect option has a name, and the psi point cost of that option appears in parentheses after its name. You must spend that number of psi points to use that option, while abiding by your psi limit. If you don't have enough psi points left, or the cost is above your psi limit, you can't use the option.
	Some options show a range of psi points, rather than a specific cost. To use that option, you must spend a number of points within that point range, still abiding by your psi limit. Some options let you spend additional psi points to increase a discipline's potency. Again, you must abide by your psi limit, and you must spend all the points when you first use the discipline; you can't decide to spend additional points once you see the discipline in action.
	Each option notes specific information about its effect, including any action required to use it and its range.

Components:
Disciplines don't require the components that many spells require. Using a discipline requires no spoken words, gestures, or materials. The power of psionics comes from the mind.

Duration:
An effect option in a discipline specifies how long its effect lasts.

Instantaneous. If no duration is specified, the effect of the option is instantaneous.

Concentration. Some options require concentration to maintain their effects. This requirement is noted with "conc." after the option's psi point cost. The "conc." notation is followed by the maximum duration of the concentration. For example, if an option says "conc., 1 min.," you can concentrate on its effect for up to 1 minute.
	Concentrating on a discipline follows the same rules as concentrating on a spell. This rule means you can't concentrate on a spell and a discipline at the same time, nor can you concentrate on two disciplines at the same time. See chapter 10, "Spellcasting," in the Player's Handbook for how concentration works.

Targets and Areas of Effect:
Psionic disciplines use the same rules as spells for determining targets and areas of effect, as presented in chapter 10, "Spellcasting," of the Player's Handbook.

Saving Throws and Attack Rolls:
If a discipline requires a saving throw, it specifies the type of save and the results of a successful or failed saving throw. The DC is determined by your psionic ability.
	Some disciplines require you to make an attack roll to determine whether the discipline's effect hits its target. The attack roll uses your psionic ability.

Combining Psionic Effects:
The effects of different psionic disciplines add together while the durations of the disciplines overlap. Likewise, different options from a psionic discipline combine if they are active at the same time. However, a specific option from a psionic discipline doesn't combine with itself if the option is used multiple times. Instead, the most potent effect—usually dependent on how many psi points were used to create the effect—applies while the durations of the effects overlap.
	Psionics and spells are separate effects, and therefore their benefits and drawbacks overlap. A psionic effect that reproduces a spell is an exception to this rule.

	As an action, you gain 9 special psi points that you can spend only on disciplines that require an action or a bonus action to use. You can use all 9 points on one discipline, or you can spread them across multiple disciplines. You can't also spend your normal psi points on these disciplines; you can spend only the special points gained from this feature. When you finish a long rest, you lose any of these special points that you haven't spent.
	If more than one of the disciplines you activate with these points require concentration, you can concentrate on all of them. Activating one of them ends any effect you were already concentrating on, and if you begin concentrating on an effect that doesn't use these special points, the disciplines end that you're concentrating on.
	At 15th level, the pool of psi points you gain from this feature increases to 11.
	You have one use of this feature, and you regain any expended use of it with a long rest. You gain one additional use of this feature at 13th, 15th, and 17th level.

If you hold an object and concentrate on it for 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a psionic discipline), you learn a few basic facts about it. You gain a mental image from the object's point of view, showing the last creature to hold the object within the past 24 hours.
	You also learn of any events that have occurred within 20 feet of the object within the past hour. The events you perceive unfold from the object's perspective. You see and hear such events as if you were there, but can't use other senses.
	Additionally, you can embed an intangible psionic sensor within the object. For the next 24 hours, you can use an action to learn the object's location relative to you (its distance and direction) and to look at the object's surroundings from its point of view as if you were there. This perception lasts until the start of your next turn.
