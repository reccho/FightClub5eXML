        <name>Aerial Artistry (Acrobat (Livestream))</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, you gain the ability [to] move with incredible speed, precision, and power. Few obstacles can prevent you from reaching your destination.

When you move, you can instead take two short movements by flying. Each movement is half your speed, and you must end each one on a solid object or [the] ground. If you do not, you fall and your movement ends.
